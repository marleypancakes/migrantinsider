The Covid-19 pandemic had forced a near-total shutdown of the state's\neconomy and Thompson-Herfurth, a part-time delivery driver for Uber, DoorDash,\nand GrubHub, couldn't work.\n\nLuckily, unemployment benefit expansion meant she could get insurance payments.\nHowever, Maryland is one of four states in the nation—like Nevada—that will not\ndo direct deposit for unemployment benefits. That meant that Thompson-Herfurth\nalso had to go through a needlessly complicated verification process, in order\nto get her benefits.\n\n\"I applied for it and initially was approved,\" Thompson-Herfurth told me.\n\"Everything went through... I could see how much I was getting paid each week\nand it was supposedly going to a debit card, which I could not access because I\ndidn't have the debit card yet.\"\n\nThe card was held up because ID.me wasn't able to verify Thompson-Herfurth's\nidentity—\"they had me living in Texas with a totally different Social Security\nnumber with my name,\" she said—and the process of getting the company to\nacknowledge she was who she said she was took four months. Thompson-Herfurth\ndescribed sending hundreds of emails, making hundreds of phone calls, and using\nevery resource at her disposal to try to get the company to verify her identity.\n\nAll that stress took a toll.\n\n\"I had to go to the doctor, I had to get put on antidepressants, anti-anxiety\npills because my anxiety was through the roof,\"she said. \"My hair was falling\nout. I was physically getting ill from the situation.\"\n\nThompson-Herfurth isn't the only person to report infuriating delays from\nID.me's processes. And as the company expands to more states and picks up new\nprivate contracts, it's worth looking at the disconnect between what they claim\nthey can do and the reality of ID.me's services for the public.\n\nMarshall Steinbaum, a professor of economics at the University of Utah, told me\nthat he sees the use of ID.me in the unemployment insurance process as part of a\ndeeper rot at the heart of American institutions.\n\n\"The idea that benefits fraud is pervasive presupposes that beneficiaries are\nmorally culpable even if they haven't committed fraud (but they probably have),\nwhich is a retrograde and inegalitarian ideology,\" Steinbaum said.\n\nA Controversial Processing System for the Unemployed\n\nFounded by former Army Ranger Blake Hall in 2010, ID.me uses proprietary\nsoftware to verify identities for a number of purposes, including, increasingly,\ndispensation of unemployment benefits. The company exploded over the past year\nas states turned to private sector solutions for identity verification to match\nan unprecedented surge in unemployment insurance applications at the height of\nthe Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNow valued at $1.5 billion, ID.me raised $100 million in capital in March. The\ncompany described its success in a contemporaneous press release:\n\nToday, ID.me has 39 million members with more than 70,000 new users signing-up\nevery day to its secure digital identity network. Major federal agencies, 22\nstates, and over 400 leading brands accept ID.me's login to streamline customer\nauthentication. ID.me's service is free to consumers while business customers\npay ID.me for trust and to streamline workflows.\n\nYet despite the increase in valuation, the company's effectiveness is a matter\nof some debate. Critics say that ID.me's processes are overly lengthy,\nunnecessarily confusing. This point of view was widespread among the people I\ntalked to who actually had to personally deal with the system. This dysfunction\nhad high stakes: it could result in months-long delays for already urgently\nneeded payments. These logistical delays have real-world effects, from economic\nhardship to anxiety-induced stress and illnesses.\n\nAxios reporter Felix Salmon, pointing to the company's numbers on unemployment\ninsurance fraud, claimed that drops in successful applicants that occur after\nthe company takes the reins is evidence that the firm's system is working.\n\nBut the company's seen bad press around the efficacy of its signature product.\nLong wait times and frustrating processes have been a marker for ID.me as the\ncompany has taken charge of identity verification in unemployment insurance\nsystems around the country. In Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, landscaper Mark\nSamuel told local affiliate Fox 43\n[https://www.fox43.com/article/news/local/cumberland-county-man-says-he-cannot-get-someone-to-verify-his-identity-for-unemployment-benefits/521-fd9f1578-2623-42c0-a1f8-54b68718fde6] \non April 29 that he had been waiting 45 days to talk to someone in the company's\nvideo chat.\n\n\"I'm extremely frustrated,\" Samuel said, \"and if I didn't have a full freezer,\nand we depended on this, and my wife got sick, and we didn't own a business,\nwe'd be in pretty bad shape, and I'm sure there are others in bad shape.\"\n\nSalmon didn't contest that there were problems in how the company does its work:\n\n\"There are, I'm sure, absolutely thousands of individuals who got caught up in\nthis who haven't been able to prove their identity, who are having a horrible\ntime dealing with it,\" he told me. \"I am not an ID.me fanboy in any way.\"\n\nDelays for the Desperate\n\nWait times at the video call center where \"Dean,\" a video support team member at\nthe company, works were \"days long\" at points over the winter in December and\nJanuary, he told me. It's hard to see how people survived, he said, given the\nway the system treated applicants—with or without ID.me verification delays.\n\n\"I talk to roughly 45 people in an 8 hour shift, and a common statement is, 'all\nthis has taken me a month, or two months, or two weeks, or three,'\" Dean said.\n\"There's obviously something going on that the system is not able to handle\nthese things quickly.\"\n\nEconomist Steinbaum pointed to the company's pervasive issues as evidence of a\ncareless approach to lifesaving benefits at the hands of a company using a\nmoment of crisis to make a quick buck.\n\n\"The tech is bad, the data can be hacked, vulnerable people are assumed not to\nhave ownership of their own data if they're applying for benefits anyway,\" he\nsaid. \"It's all just a gross concoction.\"\n\nIn comment, ID.me strenuously denied its wait times were in the days or\nweeks.CEO Hall  told me that ID.me doesn't usually have wait times exceeding 30\nminutes at the most, at least now.\n\n\"Wait times for Trusted Referee sessions have been consistently under 30 minutes\nfor the past month and are currently in the single digits,\" he said.\n\nAs far as the higher wait times reported by people frustrated with the service,\nHall put the onus for those delays on states for sending the company the\nentirety of their backlog at once.\n\n\"We had multiple states send us months, and even a full years worth, of\nclaimants to us for verification in several weeks due to the overwhelming fraud\nthat preceded our introduction in that state. The states decided they would\nrather have wait times go up for a short period of time than to pay fraudulent\nclaims out to organized crime rings. Of course, when states spiked demand for\nour services, wait times went up for several weeks, but that was not a function\nof ID.me’s capacity but rather a state choice to send their entire applicant\npool to us for processing at once. ,\" Hall said.\n\nEven if one accepts that as true, it's an irrelevant distinction to those\nwaiting on the company for identity verification, and puts the lie to Hall's\nclaim that \"no one is waiting days or weeks to verify — or even close to that.\"\nAfter all, not everyone has the time to wait hours on end to get through to\nsomeone on the other end of a video chat, assuming that their internet doesn't\ncut out and bump them back out of line. While ID.me's failures to provide\nverification in a timely manner has caused countless problems for users, the\nreal issue with unemployment insurance is a deeper, systemic one,\nThompson-Herfurth told me. A government-wide failure at the state and federal\nlevel to provide benefits to those who lost their jobs during an unprecedented\neconomic crisis is at the root of the problem.\n\n\"I think the government needs to step up and provide a better paying system for\njobs,\" said Thompson-Herfurth.\n\nOrganizing to Secure Support for the Unemployed\n\nDustin Branch, a national digital and distributed organizer with Unemployed\nWorkers United, currently located in Orlando, Florida, filed for unemployment\nlast year and entered the labyrinthine world of identity verification that ID.me\nruns as part of its contracts with state governments. Branch, who worked for the\nBernie Sanders campaign in Nevada in 2020, found himself out of work with the\npandemic bearing down after the campaign shut down.\n\nLike Maryland, Nevada's unemployment system requires people to get a Bank of\nAmerica prepaid card for their funds, which are deposited into the account. You\ncan do a check, Branch told me, but that takes months. It took him nearly a year\nto get through Nevada's unemployment insurance system and then the bank's\nidentity verification system, run by ID.me, held up his payments.\n\n\"It wasn't until March 15th of 2021 that I finally got my unemployment\nbenefits,\" Branch said. \"So almost a full year from when I first applied—and the\nsame day that I got notification that this deposit had been made, Bank of\nAmerica blocked my card for identity verification. So there is no way for me to\ntransfer it out.\"\n\nHe called the unemployment insurance system in Nevada to make sure the correct\ndocuments were in place, and the state agency assured him they were. But that\ndidn't matter, ID.me didn't have his identity verified. He would eventually, in\nMay—two months later—get the whole thing sorted out.\n\nBranch, who called the verification process \"completely absurd,\" told me that\nwhile ID.me had his information from the moment he applied last year, the holds\nwere put on anyway, evidence of the outdated system in place.\n\n\"Thousands of people have been denied and had their claims and their benefits\nput on hold because of this,\" Branch said.\n\nA California worker who dealt with ID.me in that state— who I’ll refer to as\nStephen—was one of those people. He told me that fighting to verify his identity\nwith the company was a nightmare. As well as being slow, the process almost\nresulted in him having to pay back four months of unemployment insurance\nbenefits.\n\n\"I’d only been back working for a couple of months at that point, after several\nmonths without any income,\" Stephen said. \"The idea of my wages being possibly\ngarnished and owing back all that expanded UI was extremely stressful.\"\n\nThe process Stephen had to go through to verify his identity, he told me, was \n\"needlessly stressful and a huge time suck.\"\n\nUnemployed Workers Left Without A Choice\n\n\"Because of my work here at Unemployed Workers United, I'm taken care of,\"\nBranch said. \"I don't have to worry as much about getting these funds next week\nor paying my rent or paying my car—but while I was out of work, those are the\nthings I was worrying about. I was terrified.\"\n\nDue to his work, Branch talks to people in the working class around the nation.\nThey all tell him the same thing: the jobs they were doing before aren't back. \nThat means either riding it out with governmental assistance as the pandemic\ndanger recedes — or taking a low paying job without the salary and protections\ntheir skill level should command.\n\n\"They're all saying, oh, everything's fine, we're back to the way it was, we're\nall good to go—people can go right back to work,\" Branch said. \"And that is just\nnot the reality. People have not caught up. Some people haven't even caught up\nfrom 2008.\"\n\nCompounding the problem is the unemployment benefit system, which places undue\nburdens on workers. The program's myriad hurdles are aimed at forcing people\nback to work—no matter what.\n\n\"People are really struggling and it is designed to dehumanize you and make you\nfeel as though it's you who's done something wrong, it's you who's not good\nenough,\" Branch said. \"That just can't be the narrative around worker\nprotections.\"\n\nThe socioeconomic hurdles of identity verification aren't lost on Dean. He noted\nthat access to primary documents is difficult under normal circumstances to the\npoor and working class—conditions which only worsened during the pandemic.\n\nThompson-Herfurth put it bluntly:\n\n\"It's disgusting that we have to go through this if we want to survive,\"\nThompson-Herfurth told me. \"We don't have a choice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal] \n\nPrinter Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nl0hah7HVNxb8KRmsyP0OjYU64p4HuUA/view?usp=sharing]","html":"<p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2021/08/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"885\" srcset=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/image-1.png 600w, https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/image-1.png 1600w, https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/08/image-1.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>This is a Guest Article for Notes on the Crises.
