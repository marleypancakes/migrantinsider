It's past time to examine where we’ve been, where we stand as of this writing and what it all means.\n\nFirst, I want to get the less significant issue out of the way. From the beginning of this episode I’ve treated the allegations of “mortgage fraud” against Lisa Cook to be a lazy pretext. I, of course, did not believe these allegations at any point. However, what was more important than the truth or falsity of the allegations was the clear motivations of the Trump administration itself. Nevertheless, over the last few weeks we have gotten confirmation that the charges are unfounded. \n\nReuters first broke the news on September 13th that Governor Cook’s Atlanta mortgage application explicitly marks the residence as a “vacation home”. Bloomberg news independently confirmed Reuters findings. The allegation of mortgage fraud against Lisa Cook coming from the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s head Bill Pulte is not unique. In fact, over the weekend a federal prosecutor resigned over the pressure to prosecute New York Attorney General Letitia James over mortgage fraud claims he didn’t find sufficient grounds for.\n\nNevertheless, I continue to think that the central issues in this case are about the constitution and the centralization of power in our legal system. They are neatly summarized by the September 2nd filing from Lisa Cook’s lawyers:\n\nI. The Court Has The Authority To Determine Whether The President Complied With The Fra’s “For Cause” Removal Provision\n\nII. President Trump’s Purported Basis For Firing Governor Cook Does Not Amount To “Cause.”\n\nIII. Governor Cook Had A Right To Proper Notice And A Meaningful Opportunity To Be Heard Prior To Being Fired\n\nIV. The Events Before President Trump Purportedly Fired Governor Cook Do Not Amount To Proper Notice And A Hearing\n\nIn other words, they are about the protections against removal by the president. The various arguments from the defense are about the scope and meaningfulness of this “for cause” limitation. Is the president “complying” with the limitation? Does the cited “cause” truly “amount” to cause? Did Cook receive sufficient due process and does the “for cause” provision in the Federal Reserve Act imply due process? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the questions that had, previous to the rise of “unitary executive theory”, been seen as mostly settled by the case Humphrey's Executor. Yet, the Supreme Court has been acting like that precedent was already overturned. Just yesterday they issued an emergency stay, effectively allowing Trump to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter without cause (she had just been reinstated by a Federal Judge). The brief decision is, however, quite clear on the fact that they plan to formally overturn the decision:\n\nThe parties are directed to brief and argue the following questions: (1) Whether the statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade Commission violate the separation of powers and, if so, whether Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), should be overruled. (2) Whether a federal court may prevent a person’s removal from public office, either through relief at equity or at law. The Clerk is directed to establish a briefing schedule that will allow the case to be argued in the December 2025 argument session. The stay shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court\n\nIt's worth quoting justice Kagan’s dissent (joined by Sotomayor and Jackson) because they make clear what the stakes of the Supreme Court majority’s recent behavior:\n\nYet the majority, stay order by stay order, has handed full control of all those agencies to the President. He may now remove—so says the majority, though Congress said differently—any member he wishes, for any reason or no reason at all. And he may thereby extinguish the agencies’ bipartisanship and independence.\n\nAs discussed previously, the supreme court has dangled the possibility of \"Humphrey's Executor for the Federal Reserve only” in front of the public or- more accurately- Wall Street. This is best understood as “fool’s gold”. \n\nAs an aside, I want to briefly note that I was quite happy to see that Cook’s lawyers cited the monograph I discussed in my first piece on this topic a month ago. It's always gratifying to see substantial impact from the documents one digs up:\n\nIn 1972, the Federal Reserve’s longtime General Counsel, Howard Hackley, explained that “[p]resumably, a Board member, like a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, cannot be removed by the President except for ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.’ Since the enactment of the original [Federal Reserve] Act – a period of nearly 60 years – no President has attempted to remove a member of the Board.’” Howard Hackley, The Status of the Federal Reserve System in the Federal Government, 50 (1972). The first part of Hackley’s statement—that the FRA’s “for cause” removal provision means INM—remains true. Unfortunately, the second part of his statement no longer does. \n\nMeanwhile, back at the burning court house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hackley quote is relevant to my core point insofar as it emphasizes that the core protections against the removal of Federal Reserve Board of Governors come from the general law surrounding independent agencies rather than anything specific or special about the Federal Reserve. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, in her decision ruling in Cook’s favor, commented on this at length:\n\n“It is a commonplace of statutory interpretation that ‘Congress legislates against the backdrop of existing law.’” Parker Drilling Mgmt. Servs., Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. 601, 611 (2019) (quoting McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383, 398 n.3 (2013)). Accordingly, the Court finds highly persuasive Cook’s argument that the Federal Reserve Act’s use of “for cause” should also be read in light of prior statutory removal provisions for Presidentially appointed, Senate confirmed roles. Those provisions consistently limited the grounds for presidential removal of agency heads or members to some combination of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance (referred to in shorthand as INM), which meant “cases where officials act wrongfully in office” (malfeasance), “fail to perform their statutory duties” (neglect of duty), “or perform them in such an inexpert or wasteful manner that they impair the public welfare” (inefficiency). Jane Manners & Lev Menand, The Three Permissions: Presidential Removal and the Statutory Limits of Agency Independence, 121 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 8 (2021)\n\nIt's nice to see courts engage Notes on the Crises friend Lev Menand’s scholarship on presidential removal powers. More fundamentally, the only way to substantiate the meaning of “for cause” in the Federal Reserve Act is the treatment by similar statutory schemes.\n\nJudge Cobb notes that Lisa Cook was not given a chance to confront the evidence against her nor given any ability to respond to Pulte’s allegations:\n\nThe Court is highly doubtful that Cook should have been required to piece together the evidentiary basis for a “for cause” removal from a scattered assortment of social media posts and news articles. \n\nEven if the notice provided had been sufficient, Cook’s due process rights were nevertheless likely violated because she was not given a “meaningful opportunity” to be heard. Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 543. At no point did President Trump indicate that Cook would be provided an opportunity to argue that the allegations were untrue or did not merit removal, or invite Cook to submit such evidence.[...]\n\nInstead, shortly after Director Pulte’s social media post was made public, President Trump called for Cook to resign—a far cry from inviting an opportunity to contest the allegations\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Trump administration appealed this decision on September 10th.\n\nThe Appeals Court issued a rapid decision on September 15th the following week. This three judge panel also ruled in Cook’s favor- but under “partisan” lines i.e. two Biden appointees versus one Trump appointee. This is foreboding because it could be a preview of a partisan decision by the Supreme Court. In reading these various opinions, it's clear that judges are struggling to come to conclusions with Humphrey’s Executor only half repealed and the “Federal Reserve” exception only gestured at by the Supreme Court itself. The current jurisprudence implies that Lisa Cook is one of the few officials vested with “executive power” with for cause protections on the planet. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dissenting Trump appointee in the Federal Court of Appeals case provides a significant hint at where the Supreme Court might go. The “specialness” of the Federal Reserve cuts both ways. On one hand, it may grant special protections not given to any other “principal officer”. On the other hand, its very importance and uniqueness leans towards reading the provision “for cause” narrowly and in favor of presidential discretion over its own removal powers. To wit:\n\nMoreover, the Board of Governors no doubt is important, but that only heightens the government’s interest in ensuring that its Governors are competent and capable of projecting confidence into markets. And in empowering the President to remove Governors for cause, Congress has specifically assigned that task to the President.\n\nWe are thus left with four possibilities. First, the Supreme Court will officially strike down Humphrey’s Executor for all agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Open Market Committee. Second, the Supreme Court will issue another “emergency stay” overturning lower courts decisions but without providing any reasoning justifying Lisa Cook’s firing. Third, the supreme court may leave Lisa Cook in place and eventually solidify the “unitary executive minus the Federal Reserve System theory”. Fourth, the supreme court may remove Lisa Cook while, at the same time, solidifying the “unitary executive minus …” theory while emptying it of content. In many ways using more emergency stays without any stated reasoning on the place of the Federal Reserve in the federal government would be the worst of all possible worlds.\n\nSome readers may think that, in light of the events of September, my piece last month entitled “Powell Will Hang Separately: The Federal Reserve Has Already Failed its Duty to Lisa Cook and the Constitution” was hasty and premature. I certainly took a very strong position early on in the process. It is also true that the early litigation has gone faster and more smoothly than I expected. Lisa Cook was able to vote at last week’s FOMC meeting. Yet, I will hold to my position. First, the controversy over Lisa Cook should have disrupted the appointment of Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve Board. It did not, and in fact the senate got him in in time to cast his dissenting vote last week alongside Cook. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost fundamentally, the real challenge at this stage is the Supreme Court. I’m sure Powell feels comforted that the “heat” is less intense than it was three weeks ago. But that heat, however uncomfortable, is also the Federal Reserve’s most stalwart ally. Letting the supreme court further erode the legal protections Powell and his fellow governors have will be devastating and letting the pressure subside makes that more likely. Lots of eyes were on the Federal Reserve press conference last Wednesday and Powell squandered the opportunity. When asked about whether Miran’s appointment to the Board while remaining on leave from the Council of Economic Advisors, Powell replied:\n\nWe're strongly committed to maintaining our independence and beyond that I really don't have anything to share\n\nVictoria Guida at Politico valiantly tried to keep the question at the front of the press conference and Powell simply avoided the issue:\n\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Do you see the court case around Lisa Cook as being related to questions of Fed independence? \n\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I see it as a court case that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on. \n\nIn a narrow legal sense these deflections may be wise but as the Supreme Court claims more and more power for the president, Powell’s legal capacity to object will become so small that it can be drowned in a bathtub. Powell may want federal reserve independence to remain above the muck of partisan politics, but it's too late. It's already there. The Federal Reserve can jump into the muck with a strategy and a plan to get out, or it can let itself be drowned in the muck by a Supreme Court issuing final judgment.","html":"\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Buy a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>The developments in the legal fight between the Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and the second Trump administration have evolved quite rapidly over the past three weeks.

Yet, the Supreme Court has been acting like that precedent was already overturned. Just yesterday they issued an emergency stay, effectively allowing Trump to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter without cause (she had just been reinstated by a Federal Judge). The brief decision is, however, quite clear on the fact that <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a264_o759.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>they plan to formally overturn the decision</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The parties are directed to brief and argue the following questions: (1) Whether the statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade Commission violate the separation of powers and, if so, whether Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), should be overruled. (2) Whether a federal court may prevent a person’s removal from public office, either through relief at equity or at law. The Clerk is directed to establish a briefing schedule that will allow the case to be argued in the December 2025 argument session. The stay shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court</blockquote><p>It's worth quoting justice Kagan’s dissent (joined by Sotomayor and Jackson) because they make clear what the stakes of the Supreme Court majority’s recent behavior:</p><blockquote>Yet the majority, stay order by stay order, has handed full control of all those agencies to the President. He may now remove—so says the majority, though Congress said differently—any member he wishes, for any reason or no reason at all. And he may thereby extinguish the agencies’ bipartisanship and independence.</blockquote><p>As discussed previously, the supreme court has dangled the possibility of \"Humphrey's Executor for the Federal Reserve only” in front of the public or- more accurately- Wall Street. This is best understood as “fool’s gold”.&nbsp;</p><p>As an aside, I want to briefly note that I was quite happy to see that Cook’s lawyers cited the monograph I discussed in <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/trump-vs-powell-the-big-takeaways-from-trumps-assault-on-the-federal-reserve/\"><u>my first piece on this topic a month ago</u></a>. It's always gratifying to see substantial impact from the <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.284270/gov.uscourts.dcd.284270.17.0_4.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>documents one digs up:</u></a></p><blockquote>In 1972, the Federal Reserve’s longtime General Counsel, Howard Hackley, explained that “[p]resumably, a Board member, like a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, cannot be removed by the President except for ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.’ Since the enactment of the original [Federal Reserve] Act – a period of nearly 60 years – no President has attempted to remove a member of the Board.’” Howard Hackley, The Status of the Federal Reserve System in the Federal Government, 50 (1972). The first part of Hackley’s statement—that the FRA’s “for cause” removal provision means INM—remains true. Unfortunately, the second part of his statement no longer does.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, back at the burning court house.</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Buy a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>The Hackley quote is relevant to my core point insofar as it emphasizes that the core protections against the removal of Federal Reserve Board of Governors come from the general law surrounding independent agencies rather than anything specific or special about the Federal Reserve. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, in her decision ruling in Cook’s favor, <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.284270/gov.uscourts.dcd.284270.27.0_7.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>commented on this at length:</u></a></p><blockquote>“It is a commonplace of statutory interpretation that ‘Congress legislates against the backdrop of existing law.’” Parker Drilling Mgmt. Servs., Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. 601, 611 (2019) (quoting McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383, 398 n.3 (2013)). Accordingly, the Court finds highly persuasive Cook’s argument that the Federal Reserve Act’s use of “for cause” should also be read in light of prior statutory removal provisions for Presidentially appointed, Senate confirmed roles. Those provisions consistently limited the grounds for presidential removal of agency heads or members to some combination of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance (referred to in shorthand as INM), which meant “cases where officials act wrongfully in office” (malfeasance), “fail to perform their statutory duties” (neglect of duty), “or perform them in such an inexpert or wasteful manner that they impair the public welfare” (inefficiency).

Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 543. At no point did President Trump indicate that Cook would be provided an opportunity to argue that the allegations were untrue or did not merit removal, or invite Cook to submit such evidence.[...]</blockquote><blockquote>Instead, shortly after Director Pulte’s social media post was made public, President Trump called for Cook to resign—a far cry from inviting an opportunity to contest the allegations</blockquote><p>Unsurprisingly, the Trump administration appealed this decision on September 10th.</p><p>The Appeals Court issued a rapid decision <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.42372/gov.uscourts.cadc.42372.01208775757.0.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>on September 15th the following week</u></a>.

I will have a premium piece about what he has to say about my “conventional wisdom processor” idea next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake out a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn extremely popular apocryphal anecdote in American politics claims that when the Declaration of Independence was signed Benjamin Franklin said “we must all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately”. It doesn’t seem to be true, having first surfaced more than 50 years after the signing of the declaration of independence. Yet it has had staying power. This staying power comes from a fundamental truth that it artfully expresses: opponents to a powerful force are easily picked off one by one and the only way to avoid that fate is to stand together and defend one another. \n\nSo much in our culture suggests an understanding of this. Whether it's this apocryphal Franklin quote, Niemöller’s “First They Came” poem or contempt for British prime minister Neville Chamberlain and his policy of appeasement, Americans are inculcated with a sense that solidarity- even solidarity across ideological differences and deeply felt disagreements- are the key to defeating authoritarianism. Yet despite having constantly been seeded with this fundamental lesson, the second Trump administration has been marked by a remarkable failure of spine across all the institutions in the United States. The early sign that American institutions would engage in systematic appeasement towards Trump in his second term was the eagerness for the most powerful law firms in the country to quickly concede to Trump and enter “agreements” with his administration. \n\nThe Federal Reserve System has not been the most craven of the powerful institutions who have attempted to placate Trump to defend themselves, but it has not been the bravest institution either. As I discussed last Friday, they were quick to concede to Trump on financial regulatory issues in the hopes that would get Trump off their back. They also ignored the attack on the legal architecture propping up independent administrative agencies in the hopes that other agencies would receive the brunt of Trump’s wrath. This is a choice to “hang separately” in the hopes that the Fed won’t hang at all. In short, the Federal Reserve has not had a particularly good record the past seven months.\n\nThe past two weeks are, however, something different. Trump first posted about the allegations of “mortgage fraud” against Lisa Cook Wednesday August 20th, 9 days ago. This was right on the eve of the most important central banking conference in the world, the Kansas City Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Federal Reserve chairman Powell’s speech is always the most anticipated speech at this conference and it may have been the most anticipated speech from a Federal Reserve chairperson ever. It was Powell’s final speech at this conference given his term is ending next May. It was anticipated because of what he might say about the Trump administration’s various attacks on the Federal Reserve and government data collection more generally. \n\nPowell's speech instead was entitled …“Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy”. In many respects it was a speech he could have delivered in 2019. You would never know a fundamental attack on his agency was in the works. Lisa Cook was destined to be fired in short order from the moment Powell stepped away from the podium without coming to her defense- or the defense of his own institution for that matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake out a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Trump has attempted to fire Lisa Cook. Chairman Powell has not said anything in her defense as of this writing. The Federal Reserve Board has given this statement to reporters, which I will publish in full because it is not broadly accessible- itself telling:\n\nThe Federal Reserve System was established by Congress to carry out its statutory mandates—including promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and a well-functioning financial system. \n\nCongress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only “for cause.” Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people. \n\nThe Federal Reserve will continue to carry out its duties as established by law. \n\nLisa Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. As always, the Federal Reserve will abide by any court decision. \n\nThe Federal Reserve reaffirms its commitment to transparency, accountability, and independence in the service of American families, communities, and businesses. [emphasis added]\n\nThis statement is fairly weak and anodyne. \n\nMore importantly, the language regarding Lisa Cook’s lawsuit of the Trump administration suggests that they are not treating her as a governor able to effectuate her duties. I think we would have heard reports if she was locked out of the building. But it's possible that the Federal Reserve is taking a “middle-ground path” where she can come into the building but will not have votes at Board meetings- or, crucially, Federal Open Market Committee meetings (i.e. the meetings where the Federal Reserve sets interest rates). It's notable that Powell and the Federal Reserve Board themselves are “co-defendants” in Governor Cook’s lawsuits. Part of the relief the lawsuit seeks is:\n\nAn injunction against the Non-Presidential Defendants ordering that they refrain from effectuating President Trump’s illegal attempt to fire Governor Cook and treat Governor Cook as a member of the Board of Governors\n\nIf you work in the Federal Reserve System and have knowledge of Lisa Cook’s current status at the Federal Reserve Board please contact me on signal at username NathanTankus.01 or over email at crisesnotes@gmail.com. \n\nThe Federal Reserve’s official statement doesn’t even come close to suggesting that the allegations are false or a pretext. The Trump administration has provided no evidence for its allegations of “mortgage fraud” against Lisa Cook and an individual can have multiple “principal residences”, as President Trump himself has. Recall that the allegation of “Fraud” is simply that Governor Cook took out two mortgages in a relatively short period of time for properties that were both listed as “principal” residences. In federal tax law you can only have one “primary residence” but mortgage law is not tax law and a “principal residence” is not a “primary residence”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake out a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is, of course, besides the point. Before anyone heard a single detail about the allegations it was obvious they were and are a pretext. But this isn’t going to necessarily be clear to the broad public and certainly not to Wall Street with its lackadaisical approach to the second Trump Administration. That is why I ended my Politico op ed discussing the role of leadership:\n\nThis is where the role of leaders come in. Leadership — especially leadership with widespread credibility on Wall Street — can effectively change the game. A particularly respected leader could make the rule of law a far more active part of how the stock market arrives at its conventional wisdom.\n\nThe leader I have in mind is, of course, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nIf Powell does not come to Cook’s defense and continue to treat her as a governor-in-good-standing, he will be the Fed chair who oversaw the destruction of the Federal Reserve’s prized independence. Given the financial industry’s myopic worldview about Trump’s second term so far, Powell’s willingness to defend not just the future of the economy but the rule of law in the United States might be one of the few things that could shake it awake. Powell has a duty not just to the institution he holds dear but to the United States Constitution and the American people to speak forthrightly at this very late hour.\n\nThe evidence is that Powell is unfortunately well on his way to sealing the Federal Reserve’s fate.\n\nPowell already made the critical error of “hanging separately” from the rest of the administrative state. The news this week of the attempted firing of the head of the Center for Disease Control emphasizes that there are areas more important than central banking where non-partisan expertise needs insulation from short term partisan political interference. He seems to have made the choice for each governor of the Federal Reserve to now hang separately from each other. Powell will, in turn, hang both separately and alone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake out a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnless, of course, he makes the decision to stand up for the rule of law and explain that the attack is not merely on the central bank, but democracy and the constitution. Powell should give a public, primetime television speech explaining the stakes, that the president’s order was legally invalid and that the Federal Reserve system will ignore the order. Federal Reserve Board General Counsel Mark Van Der Weide and the legal division of the Federal Reserve Board are no doubt advising Powell that any such bold action would open Powell up to the risk of a “for cause” firing from Trump himself. Their legal analysis is sound but their political instincts are wrong. \n\nWhen your opponent is Donald Trump you escalate in response to threats; you don’t try to appease him. Powell must do everything in his power to compel the conventional wisdom of market traders to more adequately “price in” the degradation of the rule of law. This must include tying the rule of law and the threats to the constitution to the credibility and standing of the Federal Reserve itself. Powell’s term expires in less than a year anyway. If defending the constitution and his own institution is not worth the risk, what would be? The Federal Reserve has already made the error of letting itself become isolated from the attacks on the rest of the administrative state. Powell can still change course, but time is running out. Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: hang together with Lisa Cook.","html":"\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive kg-cta-no-dividers   \" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                        <div class=\"kg-cta-text\">\n                            <p><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">This is a free Notes on the Crises article.

Lisa Cook was destined to be fired in short order from the moment Powell stepped away from the podium without coming to her defense- or the defense of his own institution for that matter.</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Take out a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>Now Trump has attempted to fire Lisa Cook. Chairman Powell has not said anything in her defense as of this writing. The Federal Reserve Board has given <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/peark.es/post/3lxda2tsgf22p?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>this statement to reporters</u></a>, which I will publish in full because it is not broadly accessible- itself telling:</p><blockquote>The Federal Reserve System was established by Congress to carry out its statutory mandates—including promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and a well-functioning financial system.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only “for cause.” Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>The Federal Reserve will continue to carry out its duties as established by law.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Lisa Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would <strong>confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System</strong>. As always, the Federal Reserve <strong>will abide by any court decision</strong>.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>The Federal Reserve reaffirms its commitment to transparency, accountability, and independence in the service of American families, communities, and businesses. [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>This statement is fairly weak and anodyne.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, the language regarding Lisa Cook’s lawsuit of the Trump administration suggests that they are not treating her as a governor able to effectuate her duties. I think we would have heard reports if she was locked out of the building. But it's possible that the Federal Reserve is taking a “middle-ground path” where she can come into the building but will not have votes at Board meetings- or, crucially, Federal Open Market Committee meetings (i.e. the meetings where the Federal Reserve sets interest rates). It's notable that Powell and the Federal Reserve Board themselves are “co-defendants” in Governor Cook’s lawsuits. Part of the <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.284270/gov.uscourts.dcd.284270.1.0_17.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>relief the lawsuit seeks is</u></a>:</p><blockquote>An injunction against the Non-Presidential Defendants ordering that they refrain from effectuating President Trump’s illegal attempt to fire Governor Cook and treat Governor Cook as a member of the Board of Governors</blockquote><p>If you work in the Federal Reserve System and have knowledge of Lisa Cook’s current status at the Federal Reserve Board please contact me on signal at username NathanTankus.01 or over email at <a href=\"mailto:crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><u>crisesnotes@gmail.com</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Federal Reserve’s official statement doesn’t even come close to suggesting that the allegations are false or a pretext. The Trump administration has provided no evidence for its allegations of “mortgage fraud” against Lisa Cook and an individual can have <a href=\"https://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2025/08/the-presidents-firing-of-lisa-cook-is-illegal.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>multiple “principal residences”</u></a>, as President <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/03/25/521474657/multiple-homes-mean-more-costly-protection-for-presidents?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Trump himself has</u></a>. Recall that the allegation of “Fraud” is simply that Governor Cook took out two mortgages in a relatively short period of time for properties that were both listed as “principal” residences. In federal tax law you can only have one “primary residence” but mortgage law is not tax law and a “principal residence” is not a “primary residence”.</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Take out a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>This is, of course, besides the point. Before anyone heard a single detail about the allegations it was obvious they were and are a pretext. But this isn’t going to necessarily be clear to the broad public and certainly not to Wall Street with its lackadaisical approach to the second Trump Administration. That is why I ended <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/new-politico-op-ed-on-trumps-attempted-firing-of-fed-governor-lisa-cook/\"><u>my Politico op ed</u></a> discussing the role of leadership:</p><blockquote>This is where the role of leaders come in. Leadership — especially leadership with widespread credibility on Wall Street — can effectively change the game. A particularly respected leader could make the rule of law a far more active part of how the stock market arrives at its conventional wisdom.</blockquote><blockquote>The leader I have in mind is, of course, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.</blockquote><blockquote>If Powell does not come to Cook’s defense and continue to treat her as a governor-in-good-standing, he will be the Fed chair who oversaw the destruction of the Federal Reserve’s prized independence. Given the financial industry’s myopic worldview about Trump’s second term so far, Powell’s willingness to defend not just the future of the economy but the rule of law in the United States might be one of the few things that could shake it awake. Powell has a duty not just to the institution he holds dear but to the United States Constitution and the American people to speak forthrightly at this very late hour.</blockquote><p>The evidence is that Powell is unfortunately well on his way to sealing the Federal Reserve’s fate.</p><p>Powell already made the critical error of “hanging separately” from the rest of the administrative state. The news this week of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/cdc-leaders-quit-susan-monarez-firing?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>attempted firing of the head of the Center for Disease Control</u></a> emphasizes that there are areas more important than central banking where non-partisan expertise needs insulation from short term partisan political interference. He seems to have made the choice for each governor of the Federal Reserve to now hang separately from each other. Powell will, in turn, hang both separately and alone.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Take out a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>Unless, of course, he makes the decision to stand up for the rule of law and explain that the attack is not merely on the central bank, but democracy and the constitution. Powell should give a public, primetime television speech explaining the stakes, that the president’s order was legally invalid and that the Federal Reserve system will ignore the order. Federal Reserve Board General Counsel Mark Van Der Weide and the legal division of the Federal Reserve Board are no doubt advising Powell that any such bold action would open Powell up to the risk of a “for cause” firing from Trump himself. Their legal analysis is sound but their political instincts are wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>When your opponent is Donald Trump you escalate in response to threats; you don’t try to appease him. Powell must do everything in his power to compel the conventional wisdom of market traders to more adequately “price in” the degradation of the rule of law. This must include tying the rule of law and the threats to the constitution to the credibility and standing of the Federal Reserve itself. Powell’s term expires in less than a year anyway. If defending the constitution and his own institution is not worth the risk, what would be? The Federal Reserve has already made the error of letting itself become isolated from the attacks on the rest of the administrative state. Powell can still change course, but time is running out.

Apparently I had my finger on the pulse of events. \n\nMy Op Ed develops the ideas I’ve been developing the past six months regarding exchange traded markets as “conventional wisdom processors” rather than “information processors” as a certain influential school of thought has claimed with increasing success over the past half century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn’t get to focus on Governor Lisa Cook but I do want to say a little bit about this. Lisa Cook is the first Black woman ever appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. She is only the fourth Black person ever to be appointed. Trump certainly has a disdain for Federal Reserve independence. However, he also has been purging Black people from government and it would be a mistake to think racism does not play a major role in how Lisa Cook has been targeted. I know for many readers this is a boring, uninteresting or even “ideological” point. In my view it is a fact and I think it is long past time to push through the discomfort or disdain that many people have about talking about racism and race in everyday politics. At the most basic level, you will not understand what’s going on without it. The attack on “DEI” is part of the restructuring of our government around Trump’s personal agenda.\n\nLisa Cook deserves better and it will be shameful at many different levels if Chairman Powell does not come out swinging in defense of her. Onto the Op Ed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Markets Aren’t Freaking Out Over Trump’s Attack on the Fed And why that’s a big mistake.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s campaign to dominate the Federal Reserve reached new heights with his effort to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook — and Wall Street responded with a yawn. The tepid reaction from markets is perhaps shocking, but it’s not surprising.\n\nThe second Trump administration has been consumed by two central themes. The first theme is the unprecedented pace at which this administration has attacked the rule of law and the constitutional system on which it is built. The second theme is the unprecedented weakness of the response from major institutions to the Trump administration’s actions. Wall Street’s passivity amid Trump’s unprecedented attack on the Fed is only the latest example.\n\nTo economists, the independence of the Federal Reserve is particularly sacrosanct. They think absolute independence from the president and Congress is the best result for the economy in the long term. Trump, on the other hand, views an independent Fed as his enemy; for months, he’s been browbeating Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates in order to boost the economy, despite Powell’s public views that so far, the time hasn’t been right. Trump sees the world as a real estate developer first, and to real estate developers, lower interest rates are like manna from heaven.\n\nThroughout Trump’s campaign targeting the Fed, investors have remained remarkably calm, even now.

I have continued to work full time on Notes on the Crises but the work of setting up a physical office takes significant time and energy. Among other things, I have secured a fiscal sponsor so I could take 501(c)3 donations, and continue to pursue investigative work which is taking time and effort to gestate. One small project I can publicly reveal is that, with the help of the yeowoman’s efforts of John Jay student Josie-Grace Valerius I can say that the Notes on the Crises Youtube channel is now hosting the obscure and previously inaccessible recordings of public meetings of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. I thought it was important to preserve these videos with the recent threats to FSOC.\n\nThere are other projects I have been working on as well that I am not quite ready to publicly reveal-including frankly, some unexpected but typical delays. Readers will be hearing more about all of these developments-and more- very soon. Finally, frankly, after the first five months covering Trump I also needed to slow down to prevent burnout. Now that I've worked through a large backlog of administrative tasks and project gestation, I can refocus on writing.\n\nHowever, rather than picking up some of the threads of my coverage going into the summer, I need to cover the monumental developments over the intensifying conflict between Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. In certain respects it is strange how little I’ve written about the Federal Reserve. Right up until my January 31st piece on impoundment, the Federal Reserve was the focus of almost all my writing at Notes on the Crises. I spent the last year and a half of the Biden administration intensively doing archival research related to the Federal Reserve, while issuing hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests targeting the Federal Reserve. \n\nIn fact, I issued so many FOIA requests over that period of time that the 2025 FOIA report obliquely referenced my FOIA requests to explain the increase of its backlog;\n\nIn addition, approximately twenty-two percent of the incoming requests involved complex information from five news media requesters pertaining to Board members' communications and meetings with members of the executive branch as well as various memoranda concerning a Federal Reserve System publication. [emphasis added]\n\nThose “various memoranda” were memos mentioned in the 30,000 page 1967-1973 Federal Reserve Board Minutes which I successfully acquired through FOIA last year (which are now searchable and freely available on this website). That’s without even mentioning auctioning off a book proposal about the Federal Reserve entitled Picking Losers in April 2023. \n\nSo if I’m obsessed with the Federal Reserve, why haven’t I been writing about it? Well in large part it's because I was so busy, and I found it challenging to gather all of my complicated thoughts about the Federal Reserve at this moment. Another reason is that I simply thought the other aspects of the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis mattered much more. At this point, however, I would be shirking my responsibility as a Federal Reserve expert not to comment on the situation. So here goes…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake out a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait, What’s Going On?\n\nSome readers may not really have clocked the burgeoning conflict between Trump and Powell. The bottom line is that President Trump has long criticized Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell for either raising interest rates or not lowering them. \n\nIn this respect Trump is straightforwardly bringing his intuitions from his time as a real estate developer. Real estate is an incredibly leveraged industry where relatively small variations in interest rates can raise a project’s average total costs dramatically. As no less than economist Hyman Minsky pointed out in 1990:\n\nTwo factors made Trump somewhat unique--one was that he developed a fortune in a period of high real interest rates, and the second was that the cash flows on most of Trump's properties were negative. [...] Trump was golden--he had the magic touch– as long as property prices were increasing at a more rapid rate than the interest rate on the borrowed funds. [...] In the short run Trump could make his interest payments with funds from new loans– but when the increase in property prices declined to a value below the interest rate, Trump would become short of the cash necessary to pay the interest on the outstanding loans\n\nIn this commentary Minsky anticipates Trump’s bankruptcies- and perhaps even his October 1990 default to lenders; although it is not one of his, shall we say, more impressive predictions. The point is, Trump is a man who might never have gone bankrupt at all if the Federal Reserve had cut interest rates in 1990- or raised them in 1988 and 1989. The best way to understand him is to see these moments as permanently imprinted on his consciousness.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has, of course, not been cooperating. This is both because of its views of the general macroeconomic picture and, specifically, the impact of Trump’s erratic tariff policies. Thus, inevitably, the attacks began. Trump spent the summer going back and forth over whether he was going to fire Powell, ultimately backing off- at least for now. A major part of the Trump Administration’s attack was over Federal Reserve Board building renovations and cost overruns. This led to a comic scene of Trump and Powell wearing hard hats walking through a construction site and arguing over budget numbers on a piece of paper. The point is, the pressure is clearly very much on.\n\nJust this Wednesday, a new attack emerged- this time targeting Fed governor Lisa Cook- the first Black woman (or woman of color for that matter) appointed to the Federal Reserve Board. The head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency is apparently accusing her of committing “mortgage fraud” in 2021. She has explicitly told the press that she will “not be bullied”. Trump clearly intends to bend the Federal Reserve to his will, just like he has done- or has been attempting- with every other administrative agency.\n\n\nFederal Reserve Independence is An Ideology, Not a Legal Arrangement\n\nWhich brings us to “central bank independence”. The phrase “central bank independence” gets thrown around so much that I think many readers believe that this is a reference to some statute or law. Failing that, it might seem to have a particular or precise meaning. In fact, this idea is not encoded anywhere in U.S. law. Even in places where some form of “central bank independence” is legally encoded, the ideology came well before the legal niceties. As I wrote about in my 2021 piece (that I only belatedly published earlier this year), this ideology is a crude and amateurish attempt to cover some of the core issues debated in administrative law. This is important for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, let's have a little refresher on the basics of “law”. The term “laws” is imprecise. Typically, when we think of “laws” we think of bills passed by congress. They are, as the phrase goes, “signed into law”. Passed bills are known as “statutes”. Yet, an executive order also has the “force of law”. A constitution- specifically the United States constitution- is supposed to stand above all of these. An unconstitutional statute, even if it's passed by congress and signed by the president, is overruled by the constitution itself. At least, that’s notionally how it's “supposed” to work.\n\nThen there are court decisions. Court decisions which overturn precedent are sometimes described as “reinterpreting” law. However, another way of thinking about this- which I think is more useful for people who aren’t invested in the ins and outs of the legal system- is that Courts create law. Roe v. Wade made abortion legal nationwide when it was not before.  Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in turn made it legal for states to overtly criminalize abortion. These were forms of legal creation and destruction. Now, of course, courts are “supposed” to constrain their legal creation and destruction to the ambiguities and contradictions between constitutional provisions, congressional statutes, executive orders and administrative agency guidances etc. The “symbolism” of interpretation is where courts are supposed to derive their legitimacy and ultimately, other bodies of law “should” dominate; Emphasis on should. \n\nToday, of course, it is plain that if this was ever true- it is not true today. The Supreme Court blatantly places Trump administration executive orders above statutory and constitutional provisions. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Jackson aptly summarized the current situation in a dissenting decision just yesterday: “This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.” This situation is, of course, what I’ve been fixated on from even before I became aware of the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis. As I wrote in my impoundment piece on January 31st “As a famous twentieth century statesman might have said in this situation ‘...and how many divisions does the Constitution have?’” Legitimacy is being treated as a sucker’s game and as long as no major institution responds, isn’t it a sucker’s game? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Notes on the Crises!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis “view of law from space” might seem far afield of our topic today, but it is not. It's important to have the big picture in mind because it helps us clarify what concretely protects the Federal Reserve’s “independence”. The founding moment of Federal Reserve independence known as the “Fed-Treasury Accord” happened in March 1951. Note the phrasing: “accord”. It was not a law, it wasn’t even an administrative guidance. It was a terse press release from two government agencies. In other words it's not law- it's a norm. And, as we all know, norms are not long for this world under Donald Trump. The fundamental legal basis for the Fed’s so-called independence was created not in 1951 but in 1935. \n\nSince February 2024 I have, again and again, gone back to the 7 monographs written by one of the most important General Counsels of the Federal Reserve Board- Howard Hackley- which I got from the Federal Reserve through FOIA in discussing the Fed’s legal structure. The most important monograph- “The Status Of The Federal Reserve System In The Federal Government”- is the most comprehensive publicly available legal treatise on the Federal Reserve’s independence- or lack thereof- within the Federal Government.  This book makes plain that the Federal Reserve’s independence rests on two foundations- that it is not subject to the appropriations process in determining its budget and the legal protections its leadership has against removal. The question of firing Powell- or any other member of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee- is a matter of the latter.\n\n\nPowell’s Executor\n\nThose protections against removal come from the Banking Act of 1935- which, by happenstance, was signed into law by FDR 90 years ago tomorrow. They built on a supreme court decision which had come just three months beforehand called Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. As I wrote about all the way back in February, this case ruled that FDR’s firing of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioner was unconstitutional. Its protections were clearly built atop that recent case. This means that there are no special statutory or constitutional protections for the Federal Reserve’s discretion relative to the President. It has the protection that any other independent administrative agency has- or doesn’t have.\n\nWhich brings us to the fact that Humphrey’s Executor was struck down by the current supreme court mere days before its 90th anniversary. This is, of course, the holy grail of right wing proponents of “Unitary Executive Theory” i.e. the idea that all “executive power” is under the president’s direct control. A February 18th “Fact Sheet” from the White House summarizing the executive order “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies” neatly summarizes this “theory”:\n\nTherefore, because all executive power is vested in the President, all agencies must: (1) submit draft regulations for White House review—with no carve-out for so-called independent agencies and (2) consult with the White House on their priorities and strategic plans, and the White House will set their performance standards\n\nThe category of “independent agency” is thus, in the view of the Trump administration and the Supreme Court, dead. \n\nWell, the above is a little misleading because I cut a crucial part of the “fact sheet” out. It does give an exception to its sweeping “no carve-out” position. The fact sheet, following the executive order itself, says “except for the monetary policy functions of the Federal Reserve;” [emphasis added]. This exception is, of course, completely ad-hoc. It should not be comforting to even the narrowest supporter of “central bank independence”. Yet the “conventional wisdom processor” on Wall Street did not react with alarm to this executive order the way it should have.\n\nThe Supreme Court itself took this ad-hoc exemption and ran with it. It made up an absurd and patently false legislative history for the Federal Reserve system in Trump v. Wilcox:\n\nFinally, respondents Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris contend that arguments in this case necessarily implicate the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections for members of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or other members of the Federal Open Market Committee. [...] We disagree. The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States [emphasis added]\n\nThis is simply not true. As Columbia law professor Lev Menand says in a quickly written takedown of this claim:\n\nBut the Federal Reserve Board and the FOMC are not banks, nor are they corporations, nor are they lending new money to households and businesses like the national banks (antebellum and postbellum). The Federal Reserve Board and the FOMC are government agencies designed to regulate banks\n\nThe dissenting Supreme Court justices also note this bizarre Federal Reserve carveout. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Notes on the Crises!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Elena Kagan states in her dissent:\n\nThe majority closes today’s order by stating, out of the blue, that it has no bearing on “the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections” for members of the Federal Reserve Board or Open Market Committee. Ante, at 2. I am glad to hear it, and do not doubt the majority’s intention to avoid imperiling the Fed. But then, today’s order poses a puzzle. For the Federal Reserve’s independence rests on the same constitutional and analytic foundations as that of the NLRB, MSPB, FTC, FCC, and so on—which is to say it rests largely on Humphrey’s. [...]\n\nBecause one way of making new law on the emergency docket (the deprecation of Humphrey’s) turns out to require yet another (the creation of a bespoke Federal Reserve exception). If the idea is to reassure the markets, a simpler—and more judicial—approach would have been to deny the President’s application for a stay on the continued authority of Humphrey’s\n\nThis “bespoke” Federal Reserve exemption is one reason that Trump’s attack focuses on building renovations- i.e. Federal Reserve fiscal policy. \n\nThe Fed may be independent in its “monetary functions”, whatever that is, but that implies presidential supremacy on “non-monetary” matters. The Federal Reserve itself has taken on this kind of interpretation which is why it left the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) before Trump was even inaugurated and Michael Barr stepped down as vice chair for supervision. It's hard to see why direct control of financial regulation by the president is less “dangerous” than interest rate policy and/or financial asset purchase and sale policy.\n\nOf course, the “Federal Reserve” exception will hold only as long as it is of use to the president. Powell may boldly say that firing him is “not permitted under the law” but, absent radical and bold action on his part, the battle over whether Trump can just fire him was lost when Humphrey’s Executor died in May.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Notes on the Crises!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Unitary Executive is Not a Solution to the Problems with Monetary Policy\n\nSome progressive commentators are embracing presidential supremacy over monetary policy as an outlet for “Democracy”. This has been something I’ve opposed for years. My 2021 commentary on this issue I think holds up quite well:\n\nWhile in some respects attractive, the self-styled populist perspective is a trap. By accepting the premise that monetary policy is only democratic if interest rates and credit policy decisions are directly set by legislatures or heads of state, outside critics help reinforce the choice of economists to conflate anti-democratic preferences, with issues of administrative action, and careful deliberation. In the post-Trump world, it is easy to casually dismiss such suggestions as dangerous and defend central bank independence as a kind of “lesser evil” to those who are not deeply invested in the issue. Professor Skinner’s beginning submission to this roundtable is a strong recounting of this “lesser evil” case.\n\nWe do not have to accept this dichotomy. Rejecting central bank independence doesn’t have to mean rejecting administrative discretion, or some degree of independence from short-term political considerations heads of states and legislatures face. Conversely, arguing for “democratizing” central banking doesn’t necessarily mean more legislative or executive determination of the day to day — or even year to year — decisions. Once we learn to ignore this false dichotomy, we can start to imagine a variety of administrative structures which provide ordinary people the ability to provide meaningful input into these decisions. [emphasis added]\n\nUnitary Executive Theory was on my mind when I wrote those words and the second Trump administration has illustrated my point in spades. We are in a constitutional crisis where the centralization of power under direct control of the president and the disempowerment of independent administrative agencies, congress and the courts is moving forward at a truly breathtaking pace. It's farcical to see yet more Trump capriciousness as a victory for “democracy”.\n\nI have so much more to say on this topic. I want to comment on the fascinating episode between Trump and Powell over Federal Reserve renovations more. I want to comment on the interaction between interest rate policy and government interest payments. I want to unpack whether direct control over monetary policy would even accomplish what Trump would hope to accomplish. But this piece is already very long and we need to see what Chairman Powell will say at Jackson Hole today. I’m very much looking forward to it.","html":"\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive kg-cta-no-dividers   kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Support Notes on the Crises!\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>Hello readers; I’m long overdue for major updates across a whole range of issues.

So here goes…</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive kg-cta-no-dividers   kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Take out a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<h2 id=\"wait-what%E2%80%99s-going-on\"><strong>Wait, What’s Going On?</strong></h2><p>Some readers may not really have clocked the burgeoning conflict between Trump and Powell. The bottom line is that President Trump has long criticized Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell for either raising interest rates or not lowering them.&nbsp;</p><p>In this respect Trump is straightforwardly bringing his intuitions from his time as a real estate developer. Real estate is an incredibly leveraged industry where relatively small variations in interest rates can raise a project’s average total costs dramatically. As no less than economist Hyman Minsky pointed <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1093&context=hm_archive&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>out in 1990</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Two factors made Trump somewhat unique--one was that he developed a fortune in a period of high real interest rates, and the second was that the cash flows on most of Trump's properties were negative. [...] Trump was golden--he had the magic touch– as long as property prices were increasing at a more rapid rate than the interest rate on the borrowed funds. [...] In the short run Trump could make his interest payments with funds from new loans– but when the increase in property prices declined to a value below the interest rate, Trump would become short of the cash necessary to pay the interest on the outstanding loans</blockquote><p>In this commentary Minsky anticipates Trump’s bankruptcies- and perhaps even his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-fact-checking-and-analysis-of-the-first-presidential-debate/fact-check-has-trump-declared-bankruptcy-four-or-six-times/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>October 1990 default to lenders</u></a>; although it is not one of his, shall we say, more impressive predictions. The point is, Trump is a man who might never have gone bankrupt at all if the Federal Reserve had cut interest rates in 1990- or raised them in 1988 and 1989. The best way to understand him is to see these moments as permanently imprinted on his consciousness.</p><p>The Federal Reserve has, of course, not been cooperating. This is both because of its views of the general macroeconomic picture and, specifically, the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20250730.pdf\"><u>impact of Trump’s erratic tariff policies</u></a>. Thus, inevitably, the attacks began. Trump spent the summer going back and forth over whether he was going to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/22/trump-backs-away-from-firing-powell-hes-going-to-be-out-pretty-soon-anyway.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>fire Powell</u></a>, ultimately backing off- at least for now. A major part of the Trump Administration’s attack was over Federal Reserve Board building renovations and cost overruns. This led to a comic scene of Trump and Powell <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/24/politics/video/president-trump-jerome-powell-renovation-exchange-digvid?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>wearing hard hats walking through a construction site</u></a> and arguing over budget numbers on a piece of paper. The point is, the pressure is clearly very much on.</p><p>Just this Wednesday, a new attack emerged- this time targeting Fed governor Lisa Cook- the first Black woman (or woman of color for that matter) appointed to the Federal Reserve Board. The head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency is apparently accusing her of committing <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/economy/trump-pushes-for-fed-governor-lisa-cook-resignation?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“mortgage fraud” in 2021</u></a>. She has explicitly told the press that she will <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/economy/trump-pushes-for-fed-governor-lisa-cook-resignation?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“not be bullied”</u></a>. Trump clearly intends to bend the Federal Reserve to his will, just like he has done- or has been attempting- with every other administrative agency.</p><h2 id=\"federal-reserve-independence-is-an-ideology-not-a-legal-arrangement\"><strong>Federal Reserve Independence is An Ideology, Not a Legal Arrangement</strong></h2><p>Which brings us to “central bank independence”. The phrase “central bank independence” gets thrown around so much that I think many readers believe that this is a reference to some statute or law. Failing that, it might seem to have a particular or precise meaning. In fact, this idea is <strong>not encoded anywhere</strong> in U.S. law. Even in places where some form of “central bank independence” is legally encoded, the ideology came well before the legal niceties. As I wrote about in my 2021 piece (that I only <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/just-another-administrative-agency-preserving-central-bank-discretion-without-illusions/\"><u>belatedly published earlier this year</u></a>), this ideology is a crude and amateurish attempt to cover some of the core issues debated in administrative law. This is important for a few reasons.</p><p>First, let's have a little refresher on the basics of “law”. The term “laws” is imprecise. Typically, when we think of “laws” we think of bills passed by congress. They are, as the phrase goes, “signed into law”. Passed bills are known as “statutes”. Yet, an executive order also has the “force of law”. A constitution- specifically the United States constitution- is supposed to stand above all of these. An unconstitutional statute, even if it's passed by congress and signed by the president, is overruled by the constitution itself. At least, that’s notionally how it's “supposed” to work.</p><p>Then there are court decisions. Court decisions which overturn precedent are sometimes described as “reinterpreting” law. However, another way of thinking about this- which I think is more useful for people who aren’t invested in the ins and outs of the legal system- is that Courts <em>create</em> <em>law</em>. Roe v. Wade made abortion legal nationwide when it was not before. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization</u></a> in turn made it legal for states to overtly criminalize abortion. These were forms of legal creation and destruction. Now, of course, courts are “supposed” to constrain their legal creation and destruction to the ambiguities and contradictions between constitutional provisions, congressional statutes, executive orders and administrative agency guidances etc. The “symbolism” of interpretation is where courts are supposed to derive their legitimacy and ultimately, other bodies of law “should” dominate; Emphasis on <strong>should</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, of course, it is plain that if this was ever true- it is not true today. The Supreme Court blatantly places Trump administration executive orders above statutory and constitutional provisions. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Jackson aptly summarized the current situation in a dissenting decision <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a103_kh7p.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>just yesterday</u></a>: “<em>This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules</em>. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.” This situation is, of course, what I’ve been fixated on from even before I became aware of the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis. As I wrote in <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>my impoundment piece on January 31st</u></a> “As a famous twentieth century statesman might have said in this situation ‘...and how many divisions does the Constitution have?’” Legitimacy is being treated as a sucker’s game and as long as no major institution responds, isn’t it a sucker’s game?&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive kg-cta-no-dividers   kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Support Notes on the Crises!\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>This “view of law from space” might seem far afield of our topic today, but it is not. It's important to have the big picture in mind because it helps us clarify what concretely protects the Federal Reserve’s “independence”. The founding moment of Federal Reserve independence known as the <a href=\"https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2001/winter/leachhetzel?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“Fed-Treasury Accord”</u></a> happened in March 1951. Note the phrasing: “accord”. It was not a law, it wasn’t even an administrative guidance. It was a terse press release from two government agencies. In other words it's not law- it's a <em>norm</em>. And, as we all know, norms are not long for this world under Donald Trump. The fundamental legal basis for the Fed’s so-called independence was created not in 1951 but in 1935.&nbsp;</p><p>Since February 2024 I have, again and again, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/revealed-the-seven-secret-federal-reserve-books-i-won-through-foia/\"><u>gone back to the 7 monographs</u></a> written by one of the most important General Counsels of the Federal Reserve Board- Howard Hackley- which I got from the Federal Reserve through FOIA in discussing the Fed’s legal structure. The most important monograph- <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2023/12/Hackley-1972.-The-Status-of-the-Federal-Reserve-System-in-the-Federal-Government.pdf\"><u>“The Status Of The Federal Reserve System In The Federal Government”</u></a>- is the most comprehensive publicly available legal treatise on the Federal Reserve’s independence- or lack thereof- within the Federal Government.&nbsp; This book makes plain that the Federal Reserve’s independence rests on two foundations- that it is not subject to the appropriations process in determining its budget and the legal protections its leadership has against removal. The question of firing Powell- or any other member of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee- is a matter of the latter. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdK3BOR_i6VenVg4-E6t7QKQhpRG53iRT24EE-WfhgBEc9lSbbdvXZ-T5youbgN3wVAX5lD-fC82r8chozTw-qq5OqRj6N3LHD6AoTN0Or-bnONzoXo95601i-hbABv21AhbR2x?key=7TIkr0Jw8bk7VR4zakFR2w\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"372\"></figure><h2 id=\"powell%E2%80%99s-executor\"><strong>Powell’s<em> </em>Executor</strong></h2><p>Those protections against removal come from the Banking Act of 1935- which, by happenstance, was signed into law by <a href=\"https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/banking-act-1935-983?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>FDR 90 years ago tomorrow</u></a>. They built on a supreme court decision which had come just three months beforehand called <em>Humphrey’s Executor v. United States</em>. As I wrote about <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-should-we-care-if-the-trump-administration-and-musks-doge-are-acting-unconstitutionally/\"><u>all the way back in February</u></a>, this case ruled that FDR’s firing of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioner was unconstitutional. Its protections were clearly built atop that recent case. This means that there are no special statutory or constitutional protections for the Federal Reserve’s discretion relative to the President. It has the protection that any other independent administrative agency has- or doesn’t have.</p><p>Which brings us to the fact that<em> Humphrey’s Executor </em>was struck down by the current supreme court mere days before its 90th anniversary. This is, of course, the holy grail of right wing proponents of <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-should-we-care-if-the-trump-administration-and-musks-doge-are-acting-unconstitutionally/\"><u>“Unitary Executive Theory” i.e. the idea that all “executive power”</u></a> is under the president’s direct control. A <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-reins-in-independent-agencies-to-restore-a-government-that-answers-to-the-american-people/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>February 18th “Fact Sheet” from the White House</u></a> summarizing the executive order “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies” neatly summarizes this “theory”:</p><blockquote>Therefore, because all executive power is vested in the President, all agencies must: (1) submit draft regulations for White House review—with no carve-out for so-called independent agencies and (2) consult with the White House on their priorities and strategic plans, and the White House will set their performance standards</blockquote><p>The category of “independent agency” is thus, in the view of the Trump administration and the Supreme Court, dead.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, the above is a little misleading because I cut a crucial part of the “fact sheet” out. It does give an exception to its sweeping “no carve-out” position. The fact sheet, following the executive order itself, says “<strong>except</strong> <strong>for</strong> the monetary policy functions of the Federal Reserve;” [emphasis added]. This exception is, of course, completely ad-hoc. It should not be comforting to even the narrowest supporter of “central bank independence”. Yet the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>“conventional wisdom processor”</u></a> on Wall Street did not react with alarm to this executive order the way it should have.</p><p>The Supreme Court itself took this ad-hoc exemption and ran with it. It made up an absurd and patently false legislative history for the Federal Reserve system <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a966_1b8e.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>in <em>Trump v. Wilcox:</em></u></a></p><blockquote>Finally, respondents Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris contend that arguments in this case necessarily implicate the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections for members of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or other members of the Federal Open Market Committee. [...] We disagree. The Federal Reserve is a <strong>uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States</strong> [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>This is simply not true. As Columbia law professor Lev Menand says in a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/08/Menand-2025.-The-Federal-Reserve-Board-and-the-FOMC-are-Government-Regulators-Not-Banks-A-Reply-to-Baude--Bamzai--and-Nielson.pdf\"><u>quickly written takedown of this claim</u></a>:</p><blockquote>But the Federal Reserve Board and the FOMC are not banks, nor are they corporations, nor are they lending new money to households and businesses like the national banks (antebellum and postbellum).

The Federal Reserve itself has taken on this kind of interpretation which is why it left the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) before <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/federal-reserve-announces-exit-regulatory-climate-change-group-2025-01-17/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Trump was even inaugurated </u></a>and Michael Barr stepped down as <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20250106a.htm\"><u>vice chair for supervision</u></a>. It's hard to see why direct control of financial regulation by the president is less “dangerous” than interest rate policy and/or financial asset purchase and sale policy.</p><p>Of course, the “Federal Reserve” exception will hold only as long as it is of use to the president. Powell may boldly say that firing him is <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20241107.pdf\"><u>“not permitted under the law”</u></a> but, absent radical and bold action on his part, the battle over whether Trump can just fire him was lost when <em>Humphrey’s Executor</em> died in May.</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive kg-cta-no-dividers   kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Support Notes on the Crises!\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<h2 id=\"the-unitary-executive-is-not-a-solution-to-the-problems-with-monetary-policy\"><strong>The Unitary Executive is Not a Solution to the Problems with Monetary Policy</strong></h2><p>Some progressive commentators are embracing presidential supremacy over monetary policy as an outlet for “Democracy”. This has been something I’ve opposed for years. My 2021 commentary on this issue I think holds up quite well:</p><blockquote>While in some respects attractive, the self-styled populist perspective is a trap. By accepting the premise that monetary policy is only democratic if interest rates and credit policy decisions are directly set by legislatures or heads of state, outside critics help reinforce the choice of economists to conflate anti-democratic preferences, with issues of administrative action, and careful deliberation. <strong>In the post-Trump world</strong>, it is easy to casually dismiss such suggestions as dangerous and defend central bank independence as a kind of “lesser evil” to those who are not deeply invested in the issue. <a href=\"https://justmoney.org/c-skinner-independence-executive-pressure-and-central-bank-activism/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Professor Skinner’s beginning submission to this roundtable</u></a> is a strong recounting of this “lesser evil” case.</blockquote><blockquote>We do not have to accept this dichotomy. Rejecting central bank independence d<strong>oesn’t have to mean rejecting administrative discretion, or some degree of independence from short-term political considerations heads of states and legislatures face</strong>. Conversely, arguing for “democratizing” central banking doesn’t necessarily mean more legislative or executive determination of the day to day — or even year to year — decisions. Once we learn to ignore this false dichotomy, we can start to imagine a variety of administrative structures which provide ordinary people the ability to provide meaningful input into these decisions. [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>Unitary Executive Theory was on my mind when I wrote those words and the second Trump administration has illustrated my point in spades. We are in a constitutional crisis where the centralization of power under direct control of the president and the disempowerment of independent administrative agencies, congress and the courts is moving forward at a truly breathtaking pace. It's farcical to see yet more Trump capriciousness as a victory for “democracy”.</p><p>I have so much more to say on this topic. I want to comment on the fascinating episode between Trump and Powell over Federal Reserve renovations more. I want to comment on the interaction between interest rate policy and government interest payments. I want to unpack whether direct control over monetary policy would even accomplish what Trump would hope to accomplish. But this piece is already very long and we need to see what Chairman Powell will say at Jackson Hole today.

One episode that I thought was particularly important was their April 30th episode with former BLS Commissioner Bill Beach. \n\nGiven recent events, this topic has become especially important. On Friday, in response to a “bad” Jobs report and a consequential data revision, President Trump fired the current head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As the discussion below will illustrate, the granular price and product quality data that indices like the Consumer Price Index are based on is collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Indeed, they are responsible for turning “micro-price data”, sometimes referred to as “Micro-CPI data” into the commonly used price indices that most people think of as “inflation”. The controversy over this typically sleepy area of economic policy is going to explode now that its in Trump’s crosshairs.\n\nThank you to Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway for permission to publish this. Thank you to Rabia Raziq, a college intern with Notes on the Crises for cleaning up the raw transcript.\n\nSometime this week I will have an article catching up on everything that has been happening on the Federal Reserve along with a more general update on what's been going on at Notes on the Crises this summer. \n\nRabia Raziq is a senior at John Jay studying Political Science and Economics, with hands-on experience at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, New York State Senate & Supreme Court. She is currently exploring topics at the intersection of national security and international economics at Notes on the Crises.\n\n\n\n\nSome of America’s Most Important Economic Data Is Decaying: A former head of the BLS on why gathering official statistics is getting harder\n\n\n\nJoe Weisenthal (01:14): Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.\n\nTracy Alloway (01:19): And I'm Tracy Alloway.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (01:20): Tracy, I've said this a bunch of times, and we've sort of danced around this issue on the podcast before, but I've said this a bunch of times. I'm sort of fascinated by the degree to which we sort of take numbers on the screen for granted. Like, you know we look at a price of a stock and it exists on the screen. It's like, where did that come from? How did that get there? Or like the first Friday of the month, the jobs data flashes on the screen and we just start talking about what the data said, what the unemployment rate was, et cetera. But we don't really talk enough about what had to happen behind the scenes to get that number to the screen.\n\nTracy Alloway (01:54): Right, I find this really interesting as well because obviously there's the data collection portion of this like—\n\nJoe Weisenthal: Yeah.\n\nTracy Alloway (02:01): You have to go out and talk to people for certain surveys, certain data points, but also there are so many qualitative and subjective adjustments that you can make to that data. So for instance, with CPI, I didn't know that CPI weightings are like different depending on what city you're in. [Joe: Oh, interesting.] So for instance, food at home could matter a lot more in, I don't know, Minneapolis compared to Chicago. It's really interesting and there's also qualitative adjustments, so if your fridge gets WiFi connectivity, then that gets incorporated into the price as well. So it's really interesting.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (02:38): It's super interesting and this is the issue. We don't talk about data collection, but it's obviously some of the most interesting stuff there is because of course things like food at home in one city should be different than another city if you really want to collect a basket. So it means that what you have is some of the most interesting economics work being done anywhere in a realm that virtually gets no attention. When we talk about data collection, you hear it a lot in politics, surveys have gotten, no one answers the phone, it's harder and harder to do high quality surveys. I think you've written about this response rates and just the actual cost of collection of all this data is on the rise.\n\nTracy Alloway (03:20): So I have a bunch of thoughts on this. I'll just say talking about the economic data might be timely as well because we know that Trump doesn't really respect, I guess a lot of official economic data and he's also trying to cut back on costs or funding of a bunch of different government programs. So it's clear that entities like the Bureau of Labor Statistics could potentially be in the crosshairs here. But you're right, response rates, lower response rates have been happening for a long time and it's really easy to look up just how bad things have gotten. If you look at the BLS website for instance, look at response rates on the housing portion of CPI, that's gone from about 70% back in 2015 to just 57% now.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (04:09): Wow.\n\nTracy Alloway (04:10): Response rates on JOLTS have gone from I think 67% to just 30%. So that's pretty amazing and the other interesting thing here is it's not just a U.S. problem. There's no U.S. exceptionalism here. You see the same pattern in other economies like the UK and New Zealand and actually in the UK just last month the Office of National Statistics said it wasn't going to publish PPI because of a data quality issue and also trade data had a problem because of errors in the data provided by revenue and customs. And now there's a task force to look at all of these mistakes and data problems that the ONS has, so something that goes beyond the U.S. here.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (04:52): This is a really big deal, especially when you just consider how much economic activity is based on being able to look at high quality data and make decisions from it, obviously in the market, but also in just sort of the quote, real economy, et cetera. Anyway, without further ado, we really do have the perfect guest, someone who knows a lot about how the sausage is made and why making the sausage is getting more expensive. We are going to be speaking to Bill Beach. He was most recently the commissioner of the BLS and he knows all about this. He was the 15th commissioner at the BLS, does research affiliated with the Economic Policy Innovation Center, and he's going to talk to us about all of these issues. Bill, thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots.\n\nBill Beach (05:37): Man, it is great to be with you and Tracy, thank you very much. It's a great topic right now.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (05:42): It's a great topic. I don't know when the process begins, but it's like I get this number. It says what the jobs report, it says how many jobs were created that month. How did that number get onto my screen or onto bls.gov?\n\nBill Beach (05:57): It gets there every month—\n\nJoe Weisenthal (06:00): Yeah, every month. Every month, it is never missed except maybe once in a hurricane or something. Anyway, how did it get there?\n\nBill Beach (06:05): Yeah, the first Friday report, the jobs report, which comes out at 8:30 EST on the first Friday, it consists of two surveys. So let me talk about the first one, which is the one you just mentioned, the number of jobs. That is a survey of about 400,000 firms out of 11.3 million firms in the United States. About 400,000 of them have agreed voluntarily to send in a pretty complex survey response every month. They send that survey to electronic collection centers. There's one in Chicago, there's one in Atlanta. That survey has to contain the 12th day of the month, if it is a workday or the closest workday to that 12th of November or whatever. And the reason for that is we want to get at least one pay period in the report. So they submit that data, it continues to be collected through almost the end of the month, not quite, but almost the end of the month. It goes from regional offices, these regional collection centers to the national headquarters in Washington where about 40 people, sometimes less, out of the 2,000 people that work there massage the data. This means that they take the data, which is in the survey, it's a sample, it's just a fragment of the total population and they multiply the responses by what are called weights and that gives us the national number.\n\nSo that number is all done pretty much by Tuesday night preceding the Friday and on Wednesday the commissioner gets to hear the data. The commissioner, by the way, plays no role whatsoever in massaging the data or multiplying the survey results times the weights. Then, I would brief the White House. The White House would then brief the Federal Reserve Board chairman, the Secretary of the Treasury on Thursday, that Thursday night usually. They're sworn to secrecy. Then at eight o'clock in the morning I would walk over to the Department of Labor because BLS headquarters is about a 20 minute walk from the Department of Labor. I would brief the Secretary of Labor and for an hour from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM, the Secretary of Labor and his staff had to remain quiet and then at 9:30 AM they could answer questions of the press.\n\nSo, that basically is the process for the jobs report. There's another survey there, interrupt me at any time, but that's where we get the unemployment rates. It's called the household survey. That's a survey of 60,000 households selected out of a sampling frame. We can talk about that term to be representative of the entire United States by demographic segments, how many people are in a certain age group, male, female, the racial and ethnic compositions in geographic locations. So it's a complex sample. That sample is done usually by Monday of the week prior to the release on Friday. And then again, I get to see the results, so the commissioner gets to see the results on Wednesday. So, that's kind of the calendar. Both the household survey and the employment survey cover the same two week period in the month. Now there may be a day or two switch there. Sometimes the household survey has a few more days in it than the establishment survey, but they all target that 12th of the month because we're trying to get the middle of the month. By the way, that's real important because if you have a natural disaster that happens prior to the 12th or after the surveys are closed, that does not affect the results even though you would think since it happened in the month prior that the hurricane might've affected employment results.\n\nTracy (11:30): So one thing you mentioned is companies voluntarily responding to these surveys and one thing I always wondered about is how I guess onerous, or resource intensive is responding to these surveys. So do I have to have a person who's dedicated to doing this every month? Does it consume resources? How long is this going to take me? And then also does the BLS ever try to fact check some of these self-reported data points?\n\nBill Beach (12:03): Those are great questions. So the survey is not just one or two questions. It takes about 30 minutes to fill it out completely. We do get responses that are incomplete and we accept those incomplete responses. The survey is usually filled out by someone who can access the company's data on wages, on total employment, on employment by supervisory or non-supervisory job functions. In other words, it's a person usually in the operations office of a company. Now we ask companies that are very large like the big box retailers all the way down to really small corporations or small firms and it becomes more and more of a difficulty for the smaller firms and we're very cognizant of that. So BLS has reduced the scope of the survey to get it as small as possible and as free of burdensome compliance as possible. It's also an electronic survey so they can fill it out on their computer screens and hit a submit button, which greatly improved our response rate by the way.\n\nSo that survey's not so hard now to fill out though. I think it still takes about 30 minutes, maybe more if you have to dig out the data if you're not in possession of it. The household survey is a totally different beast. It is a long survey. It consists of over 120 questions. It really is hard to fill out if you don't know the terminology. Let me just give you one. We ask the question on employment, are you working or have you looked for work in the past four weeks? That's the key question. We've been asking that question since I think 1943. If they answer I'm working, then they are considered employed. We'll have follow up questions about that, about their industry, about their tasks and so forth. If they say, no, I'm not working, then we say, well, did you look for work in the past four weeks? And they'll say, well, maybe I thought about it. Well, thinking about it's not enough. You can look for one day in the past four weeks and be considered in the labor force but unemployed. So, sometimes we have to have a verbal follow-up rather than they're just filling out a form. There has to be a conversation. That's why we don't do more than 60,000 households because it is burdensome for the person who's the questioner.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (14:36): This leads right into I think what I was about to ask you, which is we're having this conversation April 22, 2025, your term of office at the BLS ended March 2023. So you're actually under both the two recent presidents under the first Trump administration then Biden, but let's say it's March, 2023, how much costlier is that process of communicating with the households than it was say in 2013 or 2003?\n\nBill Beach (15:08): It was more costly certainly, and that's because of inflation and how inflation affected the wage bill for the survey.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (15:16): Okay.\n\nBill Beach (15:18): The survey is taken by the Census Bureau under a contract by BLS, so we pay the Census Bureau to go out in the field and conduct the survey.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (15:27): Okay.\n\nBill Beach (15:29): Here's an idea of how much more expensive it was in 2019, which is the first year of my term. I didn't have to find any additional funding for the household survey. It might've been just small amount, but nothing significant. By 2023, we were having to find almost $4 million, $5 million more. So the cost of the survey—\n\nJoe Weisenthal (15:52): Is that per year, per month?\n\nBill Beach (15:54): That would be for the entire year.\n\nThe cost of the survey went up significantly. Now your listeners will be thinking about the federal budget, which is in the trillions of dollars and say, oh, that's not very much money, but the bureau's budget has not really changed for almost a decade and our costs have gone up progressively. Especially during the period of significant inflation, which we had starting in 2021. So, finding additional money is really hard. During the pandemic, I found millions of dollars of couch money, unused conference fees, unused travel fees, so I could apply that couch money to purposes like beefing up the CPS or building a data—we built a brand-new data center out in the suburb of Washington. But once we were back in business and fully using entire budget, it was very difficult to find those dollars to fill the hole. And I think you could safely say, I've been arguing this now for over two years, our surveys, but especially the current population survey, the one that gives us the unemployment rate, the labor force data are dying, they're decaying, they're in very serious trouble and we will have, unless we modernize that survey, we will see a time when we will be like the British right, unable to publish portions of it that just don't have sufficient sample for statistical release.\n\nTracy Alloway (17:28): Okay, so I'm going to ask the obvious question here, but why have costs of conducting these surveys gathering this data actually gone up? I understand building data centers is probably an expensive process, but on the other hand, going electronic instead of mailing out thousands and thousands of surveys, in theory I would imagine maybe that saves you some money. So what exactly is causing the increase in expenses here?\n\nBill Beach (17:56): The problem is not with the electronic surveys. They will eventually be very cost-effective and there we're suffering from a different problem, which is just public support for the electronic surveys. So the jobs report that is that portion of it that's electronically captured by these collection centers in Chicago and Atlanta. I think those are going along all right for the time being. Our real problem is in the surveys, the data of which is collected by people, survey field survey people, they go out and they talk to the households and there the cost is the obvious one. It is the wage bill. These people are highly skilled interviewers. They're not high school graduates and I have nothing against high school graduates, but they're educated, very trained. Oftentimes economists who will go out and speak to people and do follow-up interviews, my gosh, and they'll spend hours and hours doing this.\n\nWell, okay, fine, that's great, but it costs a lot to keep those people employed. They have other opportunities, so we have to have competitive wages. The wage bill is driving that. Collection costs are a little bit higher. That is the processing costs, but the big part of that is the wage bill and the wage bill is not going to go away. That's just going to continue to go up. So, what we need to do with the household survey, what we have done with the establishment survey, the firm survey, and that is modernize it, so it is more electronically collected and then we also need to integrate data which can be obtained through the internet on households. Households maybe go onto a platform with a tablet or something and supply, maybe we go to a million households and they supply five or six questions and we combine that or blend it with person to person collected data. That's what we call modernization. It may not sound so innovative to your listeners, but it is very innovative for the statistical system. Unless we do that, the cost will continue to rise. The response rates, by the way, are continuing to decline. So that's public support and we be, we just won't have these surveys in the future. It's too expensive.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (20:22): I want to get to the modernization in a second, but just talk to us about, I mean I think you said the survey's dying, which is pretty dramatic given the centrality of this between the response rates, the increased wage bill, et cetera, how severe is this crisis? How much time are we talking about? Because I imagine it gets harder and harder to find that couch change to keep it going.\n\nBill Beach (20:49): Yeah, actually we're out of time. We have to cut down on the sample and I'll give you the evidence. My successor, the current commissioner of labor statistics announced at the end of last year that we would have to reduce the sample in the CPS. That's the household survey by 5,000 households in order to just publish the rest of the sample. Okay, by cutting back on the sample, you cut back on publishing details in the current report, you may not have enough to publish on teenagers anymore, on certain demographic groups. You may not be able to publish details on certain age intervals, like everyone between the ages of 55 and 60 or 65 and 75. Every time you reduce the sample, or your response rate falls, it kind of reduces it for you, we can talk about that. Next, what suffers are the details. Let's go to the CPI, which BLS also does. The CPI is a very big survey, very important survey, but it is oftentimes the case that we don't have details for certain parts of the basket of goods and so we will average across the months and publish for another month based on averages of prior months, but then we run out of the integrity of that average and we can't publish the bread price or something like that.\n\nThat happens more and more because we're getting less and less cooperation by retailers to allow our surveyors into their stores and to go around grabbing the potato chip bag and counting the number of potato chips in the bag. So, we've had to innovate on the CPI on the producer price index, on the import export price indexes. I hope you haven't noticed the innovations because you're not supposed to, but those innovations have saved, absolutely saved the import and export prices. We had response rates down in the 20 percentiles, completely unpublishable detail during the time I was commissioner. We went to using data from the commerce department that is collected by the customs officials and it's working out just great. So we completely left the surveys there. The PPI has problems just like the British are having now, not as bad, and we're using more and more data from private companies who will give us their data from the internet where we collect that data and we combine that with the survey data to keep the things alive on the CPI. It's very interesting. We get all of our retail gas prices now from a private company that aggregates gas prices for the retail gasoline industry and it's a very good source. A lot of our housing prices, now you mentioned housing, we're going to more and more to aggregators, private aggregators. So there are strategies for saving the survey by blending in private data with the survey data. That is not the case with the household survey of the labor force. Nobody really collects that data, except BLS. That's why these demographic surveys census has a bunch of them. Health, the health department, the Department of Health has a lot. They're in very serious trouble.\n\nTracy Alloway (24:24): So I take the point about innovations, but one of the things that's been happening recently is we have been seeing bigger and bigger revisions in a lot of the data. Is that because of the response issue? So more late responses mean that you're going to get revisions later on as those responses are incorporated. And the reason I ask is I remember speaking to someone at the BLS and here, shout out to the people working at the BLS because you can actually just call them and ask questions. They're really, really responsive—amazingly like the only government department that I really know where they'll just pick up the phone and talk to you about methodology. Anyway, I was asking about revisions to PPI for mayonnaise of all things, and the data there had been revised from like 5% to 10%, which is a pretty big change in the space of a couple months. And he was talking about how the PPI is subject to revision up to four months after it's published and it gets updated as new replies come in. So I imagine if response rates are going lower, then maybe that's contributing to some of the revision issue.\n\nBill Beach (25:34): By and large, our issues have to do with response rate. You're absolutely right, and before I go further, I'm very, very happy you said that about BLS because BLS prides itself in being responsive and transparent by the way. So that's a good thing. So I think there are two sources of this problem. The first is really hidden and no one talks about it. So let me just mention when we refresh a survey and you have to do this because people are asked to give their survey responses only for a few months and then they drop out and you have to find new people. The regional offices, there's six of them in the United States for the BLS, they have people who go out and do what's called initiate a new survey respondent. It's getting more and more difficult now to initiate that respondent. People are saying, we just don't have time. Oh my gosh, there's so many important things to do, or we don't want to give you our data because if we give you our data, then the IRS is going to be after us or we're going to have some kind of OSHA. BLS's data is completely protected from the law enforcement aspects of the federal government. It's absolutely only for statistical purposes. That does not prevent people saying, oh, that's going to happen. So if your initiations are dropping and it's harder and harder, no wonder the response rates are dropping because people are less enthusiastic. Even if they say, yeah, I'd love to be a part of it, they're not as enthusiastic as they were a generation ago.\n\nSo the real problem starts at the initiation level and we're seeing that not only in the household survey and in the price area, but we're also seeing that in another survey we haven't talked about, the national compensation survey. It's a wonderful survey on how much people are getting in union houses, union households, and non-union households in Northeast and the Southwest is terrific about that. The JOLTS report, the job openings and labor turnover survey that you mentioned at the opening. Its response rate has fallen dramatically and it's largely because people are less enthusiastic generally about participating in government surveys. It's going to be hard to stem that tide, and I think the only way we can do it is by going to these platform surveys. That is surveys that use the internet as the main platform, integrating a lot of private data and being highly original in the way we think about preparing a statistic for public use. We're just not going to be facing a different world overnight of really happy people wanting to give all their data to the government.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (28:20): It's really a fallen world, I'll say that. They won't let you in the store to look at the price of bread anyway. What would it take to get there? Can this be done unilaterally within the BLS, this sort of big upgrade? Would it need to be something involved with Congress? Would it need a budget allocation that would come from Congress? What would need to happen to get the sort of modernized statistical collection system you would like actually in place?\n\nBill Beach (28:45): I think we have to approach this like we might approach roads and bridges, right? Once Congress becomes aware that there's political liability in ignoring a problem, they generally focus on it until it's fixed. And that was the case with our national highway system, still is the case with our national highway system. We still have a lot of problems. When I go to Congress and I talk about the CPS and response rate, how we're going to lose the unemployment rate, I get immediate response and you know \"communist\", no one's ever said that to me. So, in the last congressional continuing resolution, which was passed few weeks ago, BLS got $6 million more in funding just to fill that hole that we've been talking about on the wage bill. And that was an amazing thing to get in a continuing resolution, an increase in funding.\n\nSo I think Congress presented with a plan or the administration, President Trump is wide open to disruption and change. I think if we develop an aggressive, bold, comprehensive plan about how to rebuild the statistical system so that we're using our resources much more efficiently, perhaps combining some agencies together, instead of having the 24 separate statistical agencies, maybe we ought to have just a handful. And then going from there to a highly innovative different way of collecting and disseminating data, then our roads and bridges, statistically speaking, won't be disintegrating or decaying. We will have new concrete, we'll have new structures, and you can see a future for the statistical system. I think right now speaking as a former director of an agency, one of the most important statistical agencies if not the most important statistical agency in the world, that future looks grim to me. And so change is required. It has to happen, and I think that's what we have to do. Present it with the plan, let Congress see what we're going to do and have them fund modernization, not continuation of the current system.\n\nTracy Alloway (30:48): This is a little out there, but if the problem is the response rates and incentivizing people to actually answer these surveys, could you potentially pay them to do it?\n\nBill Beach (31:00): Tracy, we've tried that. It has been tried a lot. Good suggestion. Yeah, pay them dollars. Okay, tried that didn't make much of a difference. Then we thought, well maybe they'd like to have these cards you can take to retailers and buy anything you want. Right? So we tried that. That's not the issue. I think you could pay people a lot of money, say a thousand dollars a month and they might participate because that's a lot of money, but we can't afford that. That's not out there for the statistical system. So inducements may help at the margin, but they don't change the trend line, which is going negative on the response rate. I think we're going to live with that response rate for a while. I do believe it's generational. I think you can see in the really young kids now, not the ones that are under five, but in the ones that are in their teens kind of a return to doing things together, having more social events, maybe I wouldn't say the bowling leagues are coming back and maybe that's a cultural change that leads to a greater sense of participation and support of public institutions. One could hope.\n\nTracy Alloway (32:17): I like the idea of all the kids coming together to answer surveys from the BLS. That's great.\n\nBill Beach (32:23): I think you'd get some interesting answers there. But yes, short of that, we have to be innovative. We have to change. We have to think outside the box. Otherwise this infrastructure, which we all need, it runs our country. There's no economy without the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the GDP numbers; they don't grow on trees. That's going to be either going to go away or become less reliable.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (34:11): Something that strikes me while listening to you talk and like, oh, you found a way to allocate unused travel spending so that you could keep the surveys going after the wage bill went up, et cetera, I keep rustling for the couch change. And I think about this in you mentioned, okay, well maybe the new president is theoretically open to shaking things up and doing things a different way, which you argue pretty persuasively is necessary. On the other hand, you have the sort of DOGE kick, which is sort of premised on this idea that every agency in the government somehow is just egregiously wasteful. That all of these agencies must be so wasteful that you could cut aggressively and you almost certainly aren't actually going to hit any bone. Seems to be a sort of premise of some of the cutting. It doesn't sound like to me when you described the BLS in 2019 through 2023 that this was an agency that was just you know larded up and plenty of fat that can be trimmed off.\n\nBill Beach (35:14): No fat, no fat at all. But this is the age old conflict, right? Between the entrepreneur and the accountant. The entrepreneur is always looking for innovation and change and higher return on investment and the accountant is always looking for waste and abuse. Are we using our pencils until they're only three inches long? I think that's a fruitful thing. I think you have to have both of those forces working all the time and overtime. Right now, I don't doubt for one second that a lot of the federal could use a thorough scrubbing on the things that DOGE is looking at. The statistical system has unfortunately, in my opinion, but fortunately now been through that scrubbing over the past 15 years. No real increase in budgets and yet an increase in responsibility. So efficiencies have been gained there just from the brutality of living year after year after year with the same dollar amount while your costs are going up while inflation is changing. Don't mind that because efficiencies can occur and we can do more with fewer dollars. That's okay. Innovation on the other hand, has to be kind of funded by your retained earnings and we don't have that in the statistical system. Congress has that, so we're not getting the dollars necessary to innovate and secure the future. That's the problem I want everybody kind of focus on.\n\nTracy Alloway (36:37): So, you mentioned earlier that you had used internet data to try to make up for the lack of a certain data point or a certain response from the surveys. And I'm curious, there is the sense nowadays that everything we do is tracked and recorded somewhere. Could you potentially use some of that type of data instead of voluntarily reported responses?\n\nBill Beach (37:02): So to an extent you can use that if you have an unambiguous signal and you can capture that unambiguous signal month after month, why not capture it? Why not capture, for example, certain pay bands or other things that are happening in the labor force or with wages or with working conditions? The restraint there is that not everything we want to know about the world is unambiguously signaled every month. And I go back to this seemingly easy question, are you working or looking for work? You would be surprised at the number of people who say, I'm working, but then we make that query. Did you work for pay? No. Okay, I did the dishes. Okay, fine. Well, that doesn't see in the mind of the respondent, work is defined differently than it needs to be defined in the statistics. Are you looking for work? Well, yeah, I'm looking for work. When did you look for work? Last year. Okay. Alright. See that doesn't count as the key determinant of whether or not you're in the labor force. You're in the labor force if you're working or looking for work in the past four weeks. So that seemingly simple question is not going to be unambiguously signaled by somebody answering an internet question because of the many different ways we think about our lives and about what work is, we find this particularly true as our country becomes, I think it's a good thing, more and more culturally diverse. People come in with very different views of what is work, of what is pay of what is a family, what is a household, and we have to work harder and harder and harder to make sure that their responses fit this continuous, since 1943, continuous stream of data that allows us to do these wonderful time series analysis. That's the issue, Tracy, with using internet data. Some of it can be used and blended in. Some of it from the private sector can be used and blended in, but some cannot. You still have to have that survey instrument out there asking the hard questions, doing the follow-ups.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (39:17): There are some people who simply do not believe the statistical agencies are honest or they do not trust when academic economists explain why data gets revised a year later or something like that. And they assume that there is political influence of some sort or they believe it and it goes back years. I remember 2012 years ago, Jack Welch, the Chicago guys will do anything, can't believe these jobs, numbers, et cetera. You were appointed in 2019 by President Trump and you crossed over to Biden. What do you say to people who do not believe that they could trust these numbers?\n\nBill Beach (39:57): Well, I can't dislodge their suspicions without going to some factual basis. So, I take 'em through the simplest revision process, which is the jobs revision. We had 818,000 preliminary estimate of a decrease in employment that was announced last August and everybody, President Trump was running for it at the time and he just said, look at this. This is totally dishonest BLS. Okay, so this happens every year. We compare our numbers to a sampling frame with all the people who work in the entire country and we say, is our estimate of total employment based on a much smaller sample than all the firms? Is it accurate? When we go up there and we compare it every March to this total universe, we sometimes find we're spot on less than one tenth of a percent off. And sometimes we find we're as much as 2% or 3% off that we're off more often when the economy is either diving into recession or growing rapidly out of a recession or has a period of really bad time happening. So when I take 'em through the revision process, they usually come out and say, I never knew that. And so the next time they think about, oh, the BLS is lying, they'll have that in their mind that really, we do this every year. It's the same way. And we're pretty good with those numbers.\n\nTracy Alloway (41:23): So I want to ask you about qualitative adjustments. I find these so interesting and the example I used was fridges that now have, I don't know, new and interesting features. And my understanding is that if a company is selling a basic refrigerator for like $1,000 and then the next year it sells this new advanced refrigerator for $1,150 and then it's also spending additional money, so like an extra $100 or whatever to make the more advanced fridge in cases like that, the BLS would use a qualitative adjustment. And then the year on year PPI would be something like, I don't know, it would be 5% instead of the 15% change in the actual price. How do you actually go about making those qualitative adjustments? And I imagine they must have been getting harder as things become more technologically complex.\n\nBill Beach (42:20): Well you're absolutely right. It is very difficult to do that. But we do a lot of training. A lot of people don't know that at the national headquarters there is a training suite, I think it's on the second floor at least before we moved out of that building. And so people from the regions who are the CPI and PPI field teams that go out and do the surveying, they come to the BLS for training. And in these training rooms are kitchens, there are grocery store aisles. We've recreated kind of the inventory you might find in a grocery store or a warehouse. And we will train people from time to time on the changes in the items in the CPI, the 200+ items in the CPI or the items that we're surveying at the producer price level. So if there is a change all the way from the number of potato chips in a bag, which is a very important thing when we will look at fast foods and potato chips and so forth, all the way to the technology involved in diamond cutting, we will be training people to observe the change and work that into their evaluation of the product when they're in the store, when they're in the warehouse.\n\nSo the field person will literally pick up a jar of, if I could say Pringles, and they'll say, well last month we had 36 Pringles in here and it's this month it's the same price, but we only have 32 Pringles in here.\n\nTracy Alloway (43:55): Wow. True granularity.\n\nBill Beach (43:56): Yeah. So that fits into now—\n\nJoe Weisenthal (44:01): PPP, the price per Pringle, keep going.\n\nBill Beach (44:05): Exactly. But it has to be that way because what will happen is the retailer or the producer will keep the price at the same level but decrease the item count in the product bag. And that means that the product has actually gone up in price, not, doesn't have the same price. Let me just say one more thing. Great question Tracy. That's the reason why we can't go to the internet and get all of our prices because when you go to the internet, you can't sometimes see the quality adjustments that are there. You can't see that the fact that hot dogs are just a little shorter than they used to be or the apple's a little smaller than they used to be. I don't know about the apple thing, but the shorter hotdog is definitely the case. So you to, we train these people, they're highly trained and they're also very expensive because they're highly trained people and they can see and know when to look and when to check for quality improvements. Electronics definitely, but a lot of times the producers of the electronics will heavily advertise the changes, make it known to everybody what you're selling new and improved. It's on these other items that it is more subtle and housing is a big deal because the house is more valuable if it has improvements in it. And some of those improvements are completely invisible. So we're very conscious of the fact that quality governs the price structure.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (45:36): Bill Beach, that was a fascinating conversation. I feel like some of these areas, even just talking about the art of actually conducting an interview to see if someone's in the labor force, really fascinating stuff. Really appreciate you coming on. That's something we, we've wanted to talk to someone about for a long time. So, appreciate you joining Odd Lots.\n\nBill Beach (45:55): It's been a pleasure. Thank you very much.\n\nPost-Interview Discussion\n\nJoe Weisenthal (46:13): Tracy. I thought that was great.\n\nTracy Alloway (46:15): I'm so glad we finally did that one. [Joe: Yeah.] A couple points, first of all I did not know that hot dogs have been getting shorter.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (46:21): Me neither.\n\nTracy Alloway (46:22): And it's being incorporated into the inflation data. So all—\n\nJoe Weisenthal (46:25): This is good to know.\n\nTracy Alloway (46:25): All the people complaining about shrinkflation, I guess it is mitigated to some—\n\nJoe Weisenthal (46:30): They're aware of it.\n\nTracy Alloway (46:32): Yeah, exactly. And then the other thing I would say is I thought the point Bill was making about the loss of granularity in the data was really important. So the idea of getting to the tails of the distribution or certain minorities, and the reason I say that is because we've been seeing a lot of regional and social variation in a lot of these consumer surveys. So obviously people who are poorer have been feeling terrible during the days of high inflation. And people who are rich feel pretty good, but, also inflation in Florida has been higher than elsewhere in the country. So I think it does become more important to get really, really specific with some of these statistics as we see those differences increase.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (47:18): It's really interesting to me to think about government, high quality government data as this public good and try to imagine—\n\nTracy Alloway (47:28): Infrastructure, right?\n\nJoe Weisenthal (47:29): Infrastructure and try to imagine the amount of economic activity that exists because this thing is offered for free that people don't have to pay for. And obviously in the investing world, there's a tremendous amount of interest in all this, but it's obviously not just the investing world. And so all of these questions, whether you're starting a business or whatever it is, on some level, you can do because there is consistent trustworthy data. And the thought of that going away and what I imagine would happen is, yeah, sure you'd have private versions of varying quality that would try to replace it and that exists today. There's private measures of inflation, et cetera. But that would start to deteriorate the idea of there being a gold standard. And so then you hear it's like, oh, oh, we needed to find a few more million dollars to pay the budget of the survey collectors. How many billions are riding on that few extra millions? How many? Hundreds of billions in activity. So it's just really interesting. And then his thing, explanation at the end, why survey collection for something like this makes sense to do as a trained job. And even the subjectivity of like, are you working and what does that mean and et cetera. It's really interesting to think about why it's not trivial to just send out a survey or send out a high schooler or send out a volunteer or something like that.\n\nTracy Alloway (48:53): Absolutely. Also, I just love the idea of someone at the BLS counting how many potato chips are in a bag? [Joe: I know.] Or a tube.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (48:59): You know what I, I'm imagining, I don't know, someone with a monocle—\n\nTracy Alloway (49:05): Yeah that's—a magnifying glass, examining the chips, seeing how big they are.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (49:10): Yeah, we're having the same image in our mind, I'm sure right now. Yeah.\n\nTracy Alloway (49:14): Alright, shall we leave it there?\n\nJoe Weisenthal (49:15): Yeah, let's leave it there.","html":"<p><em><strong>Publisher’s note (Nathan Tankus):</strong> </em>A while ago I got the permission of my friends at Bloomberg Oddlots to clean up and publish transcripts of episodes that they didn’t have the time or inclination to produce (Incidentally, you can check out the New York Times profile of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/03/business/odd-lots-podcast-bloomberg.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Oddlots published yesterday</u></a>).

I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (01:19):</strong> And I'm Tracy Alloway.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (01:20):</strong> Tracy, I've said this a bunch of times, and we've sort of danced around this issue on the podcast before, but I've said this a bunch of times. I'm sort of fascinated by the degree to which we sort of take numbers on the screen for granted. Like, you know we look at a price of a stock and it exists on the screen. It's like, where did that come from? How did that get there? Or like the first Friday of the month, the jobs data flashes on the screen and we just start talking about what the data said, what the unemployment rate was, et cetera. But we don't really talk enough about what had to happen behind the scenes to get that number to the screen.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (01:54):</strong> Right, I find this really interesting as well because obviously there's the data collection portion of this like—</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (02:01):</strong> You have to go out and talk to people for certain surveys, certain data points, but also there are so many qualitative and subjective adjustments that you can make to that data. So for instance, with CPI, I didn't know that CPI weightings are like different depending on what city you're in. [Joe: Oh, interesting.] So for instance, food at home could matter a lot more in, I don't know, Minneapolis compared to Chicago. It's really interesting and there's also qualitative adjustments, so if your fridge gets WiFi connectivity, then that gets incorporated into the price as well. So it's really interesting.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (02:38):</strong> It's super interesting and this is the issue. We don't talk about data collection, but it's obviously some of the most interesting stuff there is because of course things like food at home in one city should be different than another city if you really want to collect a basket. So it means that what you have is some of the most interesting economics work being done anywhere in a realm that virtually gets no attention. When we talk about data collection, you hear it a lot in politics, surveys have gotten, no one answers the phone, it's harder and harder to do high quality surveys. I think you've written about this response rates and just the actual cost of collection of all this data is on the rise.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (03:20):</strong> So I have a bunch of thoughts on this. I'll just say talking about the economic data might be timely as well because we know that Trump doesn't really respect, I guess a lot of official economic data and he's also trying to cut back on costs or funding of a bunch of different government programs. So it's clear that entities like the Bureau of Labor Statistics could potentially be in the crosshairs here. But you're right, response rates, lower response rates have been happening for a long time and it's really easy to look up just how bad things have gotten. If you look at the BLS website for instance, look at response rates on the housing portion of CPI, that's gone from about 70% back in 2015 to just 57% now.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (04:09):</strong> Wow.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (04:10):</strong> Response rates on JOLTS have gone from I think 67% to just 30%. So that's pretty amazing and the other interesting thing here is it's not just a U.S. problem. There's no U.S. exceptionalism here. You see the same pattern in other economies like the UK and New Zealand and actually in the UK just last month the Office of National Statistics said it wasn't going to publish PPI because of a data quality issue and also trade data had a problem because of errors in the data provided by revenue and customs. And now there's a task force to look at all of these mistakes and data problems that the ONS has, so something that goes beyond the U.S. here.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (04:52):</strong> This is a really big deal, especially when you just consider how much economic activity is based on being able to look at high quality data and make decisions from it, obviously in the market, but also in just sort of the quote, real economy, et cetera. Anyway, without further ado, we really do have the perfect guest, someone who knows a lot about how the sausage is made and why making the sausage is getting more expensive. We are going to be speaking to Bill Beach. He was most recently the commissioner of the BLS and he knows all about this. He was the 15th commissioner at the BLS, does research affiliated with the Economic Policy Innovation Center, and he's going to talk to us about all of these issues. Bill, thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (05:37):</strong> Man, it is great to be with you and Tracy, thank you very much. It's a great topic right now.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (05:42):</strong> It's a great topic. I don't know when the process begins, but it's like I get this number. It says what the jobs report, it says how many jobs were created that month. How did that number get onto my screen or onto bls.gov?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (05:57):</strong> It gets there every month—</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (06:00):</strong> Yeah, every month. Every month, it is never missed except maybe once in a hurricane or something. Anyway, how did it get there?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (06:05):</strong> Yeah, the first Friday report, the jobs report, which comes out at 8:30 EST on the first Friday, it consists of two surveys. So let me talk about the first one, which is the one you just mentioned, the number of jobs. That is a survey of about 400,000 firms out of 11.3 million firms in the United States. About 400,000 of them have agreed voluntarily to send in a pretty complex survey response every month. They send that survey to electronic collection centers. There's one in Chicago, there's one in Atlanta. That survey has to contain the 12th day of the month, if it is a workday or the closest workday to that 12th of November or whatever. And the reason for that is we want to get at least one pay period in the report. So they submit that data, it continues to be collected through almost the end of the month, not quite, but almost the end of the month. It goes from regional offices, these regional collection centers to the national headquarters in Washington where about 40 people, sometimes less, out of the 2,000 people that work there massage the data. This means that they take the data, which is in the survey, it's a sample, it's just a fragment of the total population and they multiply the responses by what are called weights and that gives us the national number.</p><p>So that number is all done pretty much by Tuesday night preceding the Friday and on Wednesday the commissioner gets to hear the data. The commissioner, by the way, plays no role whatsoever in massaging the data or multiplying the survey results times the weights. Then, I would brief the White House. The White House would then brief the Federal Reserve Board chairman, the Secretary of the Treasury on Thursday, that Thursday night usually. They're sworn to secrecy. Then at eight o'clock in the morning I would walk over to the Department of Labor because BLS headquarters is about a 20 minute walk from the Department of Labor. I would brief the Secretary of Labor and for an hour from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM, the Secretary of Labor and his staff had to remain quiet and then at 9:30 AM they could answer questions of the press.</p><p>So, that basically is the process for the jobs report. There's another survey there, interrupt me at any time, but that's where we get the unemployment rates. It's called the household survey. That's a survey of 60,000 households selected out of a sampling frame. We can talk about that term to be representative of the entire United States by demographic segments, how many people are in a certain age group, male, female, the racial and ethnic compositions in geographic locations. So it's a complex sample. That sample is done usually by Monday of the week prior to the release on Friday. And then again, I get to see the results, so the commissioner gets to see the results on Wednesday. So, that's kind of the calendar. Both the household survey and the employment survey cover the same two week period in the month. Now there may be a day or two switch there. Sometimes the household survey has a few more days in it than the establishment survey, but they all target that 12th of the month because we're trying to get the middle of the month. By the way, that's real important because if you have a natural disaster that happens prior to the 12th or after the surveys are closed, that does not affect the results even though you would think since it happened in the month prior that the hurricane might've affected employment results.</p><p><strong>Tracy (11:30):</strong> So one thing you mentioned is companies voluntarily responding to these surveys and one thing I always wondered about is how I guess onerous, or resource intensive is responding to these surveys. So do I have to have a person who's dedicated to doing this every month? Does it consume resources? How long is this going to take me? And then also does the BLS ever try to fact check some of these self-reported data points?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (12:03):</strong> Those are great questions. So the survey is not just one or two questions. It takes about 30 minutes to fill it out completely. We do get responses that are incomplete and we accept those incomplete responses. The survey is usually filled out by someone who can access the company's data on wages, on total employment, on employment by supervisory or non-supervisory job functions. In other words, it's a person usually in the operations office of a company. Now we ask companies that are very large like the big box retailers all the way down to really small corporations or small firms and it becomes more and more of a difficulty for the smaller firms and we're very cognizant of that. So BLS has reduced the scope of the survey to get it as small as possible and as free of burdensome compliance as possible. It's also an electronic survey so they can fill it out on their computer screens and hit a submit button, which greatly improved our response rate by the way.</p><p>So that survey's not so hard now to fill out though. I think it still takes about 30 minutes, maybe more if you have to dig out the data if you're not in possession of it. The household survey is a totally different beast. It is a long survey. It consists of over 120 questions. It really is hard to fill out if you don't know the terminology. Let me just give you one. We ask the question on employment, are you working or have you looked for work in the past four weeks? That's the key question. We've been asking that question since I think 1943. If they answer I'm working, then they are considered employed. We'll have follow up questions about that, about their industry, about their tasks and so forth. If they say, no, I'm not working, then we say, well, did you look for work in the past four weeks? And they'll say, well, maybe I thought about it. Well, thinking about it's not enough. You can look for one day in the past four weeks and be considered in the labor force but unemployed. So, sometimes we have to have a verbal follow-up rather than they're just filling out a form. There has to be a conversation. That's why we don't do more than 60,000 households because it is burdensome for the person who's the questioner.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (14:36):</strong> This leads right into I think what I was about to ask you, which is we're having this conversation April 22, 2025, your term of office at the BLS ended March 2023. So you're actually under both the two recent presidents under the first Trump administration then Biden, but let's say it's March, 2023, how much costlier is that process of communicating with the households than it was say in 2013 or 2003?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (15:08):</strong> It was more costly certainly, and that's because of inflation and how inflation affected the wage bill for the survey.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (15:16):</strong> Okay.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (15:18):</strong> The survey is taken by the Census Bureau under a contract by BLS, so we pay the Census Bureau to go out in the field and conduct the survey.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (15:27):</strong> Okay.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (15:29):</strong> Here's an idea of how much more expensive it was in 2019, which is the first year of my term. I didn't have to find any additional funding for the household survey. It might've been just small amount, but nothing significant. By 2023, we were having to find almost $4 million, $5 million more. So the cost of the survey—</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (15:52):</strong> Is that per year, per month?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (15:54):</strong> That would be for the entire year.</p><p>The cost of the survey went up significantly. Now your listeners will be thinking about the federal budget, which is in the trillions of dollars and say, oh, that's not very much money, but the bureau's budget has not really changed for almost a decade and our costs have gone up progressively. Especially during the period of significant inflation, which we had starting in 2021. So, finding additional money is really hard. During the pandemic, I found millions of dollars of couch money, unused conference fees, unused travel fees, so I could apply that couch money to purposes like beefing up the CPS or building a data—we built a brand-new data center out in the suburb of Washington. But once we were back in business and fully using entire budget, it was very difficult to find those dollars to fill the hole. And I think you could safely say, I've been arguing this now for over two years, our surveys, but especially the current population survey, the one that gives us the unemployment rate, the labor force data are dying, they're decaying, they're in very serious trouble and we will have, unless we modernize that survey, we will see a time when we will be like the British right, unable to publish portions of it that just don't have sufficient sample for statistical release.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (17:28):</strong> Okay, so I'm going to ask the obvious question here, but why have costs of conducting these surveys gathering this data actually gone up? I understand building data centers is probably an expensive process, but on the other hand, going electronic instead of mailing out thousands and thousands of surveys, in theory I would imagine maybe that saves you some money. So what exactly is causing the increase in expenses here?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (17:56):</strong> The problem is not with the electronic surveys. They will eventually be very cost-effective and there we're suffering from a different problem, which is just public support for the electronic surveys. So the jobs report that is that portion of it that's electronically captured by these collection centers in Chicago and Atlanta. I think those are going along all right for the time being. Our real problem is in the surveys, the data of which is collected by people, survey field survey people, they go out and they talk to the households and there the cost is the obvious one. It is the wage bill. These people are highly skilled interviewers. They're not high school graduates and I have nothing against high school graduates, but they're educated, very trained. Oftentimes economists who will go out and speak to people and do follow-up interviews, my gosh, and they'll spend hours and hours doing this.</p><p>Well, okay, fine, that's great, but it costs a lot to keep those people employed. They have other opportunities, so we have to have competitive wages. The wage bill is driving that. Collection costs are a little bit higher. That is the processing costs, but the big part of that is the wage bill and the wage bill is not going to go away. That's just going to continue to go up. So, what we need to do with the household survey, what we have done with the establishment survey, the firm survey, and that is modernize it, so it is more electronically collected and then we also need to integrate data which can be obtained through the internet on households. Households maybe go onto a platform with a tablet or something and supply, maybe we go to a million households and they supply five or six questions and we combine that or blend it with person to person collected data. That's what we call modernization. It may not sound so innovative to your listeners, but it is very innovative for the statistical system. Unless we do that, the cost will continue to rise. The response rates, by the way, are continuing to decline. So that's public support and we be, we just won't have these surveys in the future. It's too expensive.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (20:22):</strong> I want to get to the modernization in a second, but just talk to us about, I mean I think you said the survey's dying, which is pretty dramatic given the centrality of this between the response rates, the increased wage bill, et cetera, how severe is this crisis? How much time are we talking about? Because I imagine it gets harder and harder to find that couch change to keep it going.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (20:49):</strong> Yeah, actually we're out of time. We have to cut down on the sample and I'll give you the evidence. My successor, the current commissioner of labor statistics announced at the end of last year that we would have to reduce the sample in the CPS. That's the household survey by 5,000 households in order to just publish the rest of the sample. Okay, by cutting back on the sample, you cut back on publishing details in the current report, you may not have enough to publish on teenagers anymore, on certain demographic groups. You may not be able to publish details on certain age intervals, like everyone between the ages of 55 and 60 or 65 and 75. Every time you reduce the sample, or your response rate falls, it kind of reduces it for you, we can talk about that. Next, what suffers are the details. Let's go to the CPI, which BLS also does. The CPI is a very big survey, very important survey, but it is oftentimes the case that we don't have details for certain parts of the basket of goods and so we will average across the months and publish for another month based on averages of prior months, but then we run out of the integrity of that average and we can't publish the bread price or something like that.</p><p>That happens more and more because we're getting less and less cooperation by retailers to allow our surveyors into their stores and to go around grabbing the potato chip bag and counting the number of potato chips in the bag. So, we've had to innovate on the CPI on the producer price index, on the import export price indexes. I hope you haven't noticed the innovations because you're not supposed to, but those innovations have saved, absolutely saved the import and export prices. We had response rates down in the 20 percentiles, completely unpublishable detail during the time I was commissioner. We went to using data from the commerce department that is collected by the customs officials and it's working out just great. So we completely left the surveys there. The PPI has problems just like the British are having now, not as bad, and we're using more and more data from private companies who will give us their data from the internet where we collect that data and we combine that with the survey data to keep the things alive on the CPI. It's very interesting. We get all of our retail gas prices now from a private company that aggregates gas prices for the retail gasoline industry and it's a very good source. A lot of our housing prices, now you mentioned housing, we're going to more and more to aggregators, private aggregators. So there are strategies for saving the survey by blending in private data with the survey data. That is not the case with the household survey of the labor force. Nobody really collects that data, except BLS. That's why these demographic surveys census has a bunch of them. Health, the health department, the Department of Health has a lot. They're in very serious trouble.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (24:24):</strong> So I take the point about innovations, but one of the things that's been happening recently is we have been seeing bigger and bigger revisions in a lot of the data. Is that because of the response issue? So more late responses mean that you're going to get revisions later on as those responses are incorporated. And the reason I ask is I remember speaking to someone at the BLS and here, shout out to the people working at the BLS because you can actually just call them and ask questions. They're really, really responsive—amazingly like the only government department that I really know where they'll just pick up the phone and talk to you about methodology. Anyway, I was asking about revisions to PPI for mayonnaise of all things, and the data there had been revised from like 5% to 10%, which is a pretty big change in the space of a couple months. And he was talking about how the PPI is subject to revision up to four months after it's published and it gets updated as new replies come in. So I imagine if response rates are going lower, then maybe that's contributing to some of the revision issue.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (25:34):</strong> By and large, our issues have to do with response rate. You're absolutely right, and before I go further, I'm very, very happy you said that about BLS because BLS prides itself in being responsive and transparent by the way. So that's a good thing. So I think there are two sources of this problem. The first is really hidden and no one talks about it. So let me just mention when we refresh a survey and you have to do this because people are asked to give their survey responses only for a few months and then they drop out and you have to find new people. The regional offices, there's six of them in the United States for the BLS, they have people who go out and do what's called initiate a new survey respondent. It's getting more and more difficult now to initiate that respondent. People are saying, we just don't have time. Oh my gosh, there's so many important things to do, or we don't want to give you our data because if we give you our data, then the IRS is going to be after us or we're going to have some kind of OSHA. BLS's data is completely protected from the law enforcement aspects of the federal government. It's absolutely only for statistical purposes. That does not prevent people saying, oh, that's going to happen. So if your initiations are dropping and it's harder and harder, no wonder the response rates are dropping because people are less enthusiastic. Even if they say, yeah, I'd love to be a part of it, they're not as enthusiastic as they were a generation ago.</p><p>So the real problem starts at the initiation level and we're seeing that not only in the household survey and in the price area, but we're also seeing that in another survey we haven't talked about, the national compensation survey. It's a wonderful survey on how much people are getting in union houses, union households, and non-union households in Northeast and the Southwest is terrific about that. The JOLTS report, the job openings and labor turnover survey that you mentioned at the opening. Its response rate has fallen dramatically and it's largely because people are less enthusiastic generally about participating in government surveys. It's going to be hard to stem that tide, and I think the only way we can do it is by going to these platform surveys. That is surveys that use the internet as the main platform, integrating a lot of private data and being highly original in the way we think about preparing a statistic for public use. We're just not going to be facing a different world overnight of really happy people wanting to give all their data to the government.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (28:20):</strong> It's really a fallen world, I'll say that. They won't let you in the store to look at the price of bread anyway. What would it take to get there? Can this be done unilaterally within the BLS, this sort of big upgrade? Would it need to be something involved with Congress? Would it need a budget allocation that would come from Congress? What would need to happen to get the sort of modernized statistical collection system you would like actually in place?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (28:45):</strong> I think we have to approach this like we might approach roads and bridges, right? Once Congress becomes aware that there's political liability in ignoring a problem, they generally focus on it until it's fixed. And that was the case with our national highway system, still is the case with our national highway system. We still have a lot of problems. When I go to Congress and I talk about the CPS and response rate, how we're going to lose the unemployment rate, I get immediate response and you know \"communist\", no one's ever said that to me. So, in the last congressional continuing resolution, which was passed few weeks ago, BLS got $6 million more in funding just to fill that hole that we've been talking about on the wage bill. And that was an amazing thing to get in a continuing resolution, an increase in funding.</p><p>So I think Congress presented with a plan or the administration, President Trump is wide open to disruption and change. I think if we develop an aggressive, bold, comprehensive plan about how to rebuild the statistical system so that we're using our resources much more efficiently, perhaps combining some agencies together, instead of having the 24 separate statistical agencies, maybe we ought to have just a handful. And then going from there to a highly innovative different way of collecting and disseminating data, then our roads and bridges, statistically speaking, won't be disintegrating or decaying. We will have new concrete, we'll have new structures, and you can see a future for the statistical system. I think right now speaking as a former director of an agency, one of the most important statistical agencies if not the most important statistical agency in the world, that future looks grim to me. And so change is required. It has to happen, and I think that's what we have to do. Present it with the plan, let Congress see what we're going to do and have them fund modernization, not continuation of the current system.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (30:48):</strong> This is a little out there, but if the problem is the response rates and incentivizing people to actually answer these surveys, could you potentially pay them to do it?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (31:00):</strong> Tracy, we've tried that. It has been tried a lot. Good suggestion. Yeah, pay them dollars. Okay, tried that didn't make much of a difference. Then we thought, well maybe they'd like to have these cards you can take to retailers and buy anything you want. Right? So we tried that. That's not the issue. I think you could pay people a lot of money, say a thousand dollars a month and they might participate because that's a lot of money, but we can't afford that. That's not out there for the statistical system. So inducements may help at the margin, but they don't change the trend line, which is going negative on the response rate. I think we're going to live with that response rate for a while. I do believe it's generational. I think you can see in the really young kids now, not the ones that are under five, but in the ones that are in their teens kind of a return to doing things together, having more social events, maybe I wouldn't say the bowling leagues are coming back and maybe that's a cultural change that leads to a greater sense of participation and support of public institutions. One could hope.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (32:17):</strong> I like the idea of all the kids coming together to answer surveys from the BLS. That's great.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (32:23):</strong> I think you'd get some interesting answers there. But yes, short of that, we have to be innovative. We have to change. We have to think outside the box. Otherwise this infrastructure, which we all need, it runs our country. There's no economy without the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the GDP numbers; they don't grow on trees. That's going to be either going to go away or become less reliable.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (34:11):</strong> Something that strikes me while listening to you talk and like, oh, you found a way to allocate unused travel spending so that you could keep the surveys going after the wage bill went up, et cetera, I keep rustling for the couch change. And I think about this in you mentioned, okay, well maybe the new president is theoretically open to shaking things up and doing things a different way, which you argue pretty persuasively is necessary. On the other hand, you have the sort of DOGE kick, which is sort of premised on this idea that every agency in the government somehow is just egregiously wasteful. That all of these agencies must be so wasteful that you could cut aggressively and you almost certainly aren't actually going to hit any bone. Seems to be a sort of premise of some of the cutting. It doesn't sound like to me when you described the BLS in 2019 through 2023 that this was an agency that was just you know larded up and plenty of fat that can be trimmed off.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (35:14):</strong> No fat, no fat at all. But this is the age old conflict, right? Between the entrepreneur and the accountant. The entrepreneur is always looking for innovation and change and higher return on investment and the accountant is always looking for waste and abuse. Are we using our pencils until they're only three inches long? I think that's a fruitful thing. I think you have to have both of those forces working all the time and overtime. Right now, I don't doubt for one second that a lot of the federal could use a thorough scrubbing on the things that DOGE is looking at. The statistical system has unfortunately, in my opinion, but fortunately now been through that scrubbing over the past 15 years. No real increase in budgets and yet an increase in responsibility. So efficiencies have been gained there just from the brutality of living year after year after year with the same dollar amount while your costs are going up while inflation is changing. Don't mind that because efficiencies can occur and we can do more with fewer dollars. That's okay. Innovation on the other hand, has to be kind of funded by your retained earnings and we don't have that in the statistical system. Congress has that, so we're not getting the dollars necessary to innovate and secure the future. That's the problem I want everybody kind of focus on.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (36:37):</strong> So, you mentioned earlier that you had used internet data to try to make up for the lack of a certain data point or a certain response from the surveys. And I'm curious, there is the sense nowadays that everything we do is tracked and recorded somewhere. Could you potentially use some of that type of data instead of voluntarily reported responses?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (37:02):</strong> So to an extent you can use that if you have an unambiguous signal and you can capture that unambiguous signal month after month, why not capture it? Why not capture, for example, certain pay bands or other things that are happening in the labor force or with wages or with working conditions? The restraint there is that not everything we want to know about the world is unambiguously signaled every month. And I go back to this seemingly easy question, are you working or looking for work? You would be surprised at the number of people who say, I'm working, but then we make that query. Did you work for pay? No. Okay, I did the dishes. Okay, fine. Well, that doesn't see in the mind of the respondent, work is defined differently than it needs to be defined in the statistics. Are you looking for work? Well, yeah, I'm looking for work. When did you look for work? Last year. Okay. Alright. See that doesn't count as the key determinant of whether or not you're in the labor force. You're in the labor force if you're working or looking for work in the past four weeks. So that seemingly simple question is not going to be unambiguously signaled by somebody answering an internet question because of the many different ways we think about our lives and about what work is, we find this particularly true as our country becomes, I think it's a good thing, more and more culturally diverse. People come in with very different views of what is work, of what is pay of what is a family, what is a household, and we have to work harder and harder and harder to make sure that their responses fit this continuous, since 1943, continuous stream of data that allows us to do these wonderful time series analysis. That's the issue, Tracy, with using internet data. Some of it can be used and blended in. Some of it from the private sector can be used and blended in, but some cannot. You still have to have that survey instrument out there asking the hard questions, doing the follow-ups.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (39:17):</strong> There are some people who simply do not believe the statistical agencies are honest or they do not trust when academic economists explain why data gets revised a year later or something like that. And they assume that there is political influence of some sort or they believe it and it goes back years. I remember 2012 years ago, Jack Welch, the Chicago guys will do anything, can't believe these jobs, numbers, et cetera. You were appointed in 2019 by President Trump and you crossed over to Biden. What do you say to people who do not believe that they could trust these numbers?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (39:57):</strong> Well, I can't dislodge their suspicions without going to some factual basis. So, I take 'em through the simplest revision process, which is the jobs revision. We had 818,000 preliminary estimate of a decrease in employment that was announced last August and everybody, President Trump was running for it at the time and he just said, look at this. This is totally dishonest BLS. Okay, so this happens every year. We compare our numbers to a sampling frame with all the people who work in the entire country and we say, is our estimate of total employment based on a much smaller sample than all the firms? Is it accurate? When we go up there and we compare it every March to this total universe, we sometimes find we're spot on less than one tenth of a percent off. And sometimes we find we're as much as 2% or 3% off that we're off more often when the economy is either diving into recession or growing rapidly out of a recession or has a period of really bad time happening. So when I take 'em through the revision process, they usually come out and say, I never knew that. And so the next time they think about, oh, the BLS is lying, they'll have that in their mind that really, we do this every year. It's the same way. And we're pretty good with those numbers.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (41:23):</strong> So I want to ask you about qualitative adjustments. I find these so interesting and the example I used was fridges that now have, I don't know, new and interesting features. And my understanding is that if a company is selling a basic refrigerator for like $1,000 and then the next year it sells this new advanced refrigerator for $1,150 and then it's also spending additional money, so like an extra $100 or whatever to make the more advanced fridge in cases like that, the BLS would use a qualitative adjustment. And then the year on year PPI would be something like, I don't know, it would be 5% instead of the 15% change in the actual price. How do you actually go about making those qualitative adjustments? And I imagine they must have been getting harder as things become more technologically complex.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (42:20):</strong> Well you're absolutely right. It is very difficult to do that. But we do a lot of training. A lot of people don't know that at the national headquarters there is a training suite, I think it's on the second floor at least before we moved out of that building. And so people from the regions who are the CPI and PPI field teams that go out and do the surveying, they come to the BLS for training. And in these training rooms are kitchens, there are grocery store aisles. We've recreated kind of the inventory you might find in a grocery store or a warehouse. And we will train people from time to time on the changes in the items in the CPI, the 200+ items in the CPI or the items that we're surveying at the producer price level. So if there is a change all the way from the number of potato chips in a bag, which is a very important thing when we will look at fast foods and potato chips and so forth, all the way to the technology involved in diamond cutting, we will be training people to observe the change and work that into their evaluation of the product when they're in the store, when they're in the warehouse.</p><p>So the field person will literally pick up a jar of, if I could say Pringles, and they'll say, well last month we had 36 Pringles in here and it's this month it's the same price, but we only have 32 Pringles in here.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (43:55):</strong> Wow. True granularity.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (43:56):</strong> Yeah. So that fits into now—</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (44:01):</strong> PPP, the price per Pringle, keep going.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (44:05):</strong> Exactly. But it has to be that way because what will happen is the retailer or the producer will keep the price at the same level but decrease the item count in the product bag. And that means that the product has actually gone up in price, not, doesn't have the same price. Let me just say one more thing. Great question Tracy. That's the reason why we can't go to the internet and get all of our prices because when you go to the internet, you can't sometimes see the quality adjustments that are there. You can't see that the fact that hot dogs are just a little shorter than they used to be or the apple's a little smaller than they used to be. I don't know about the apple thing, but the shorter hotdog is definitely the case. So you to, we train these people, they're highly trained and they're also very expensive because they're highly trained people and they can see and know when to look and when to check for quality improvements. Electronics definitely, but a lot of times the producers of the electronics will heavily advertise the changes, make it known to everybody what you're selling new and improved. It's on these other items that it is more subtle and housing is a big deal because the house is more valuable if it has improvements in it. And some of those improvements are completely invisible. So we're very conscious of the fact that quality governs the price structure.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (45:36):</strong> Bill Beach, that was a fascinating conversation. I feel like some of these areas, even just talking about the art of actually conducting an interview to see if someone's in the labor force, really fascinating stuff. Really appreciate you coming on. That's something we, we've wanted to talk to someone about for a long time. So, appreciate you joining Odd Lots.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (45:55):</strong> It's been a pleasure. Thank you very much.</p><hr><p><strong>Post-Interview Discussion</strong></p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (46:13):</strong> Tracy. I thought that was great.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (46:15):</strong> I'm so glad we finally did that one. [Joe: Yeah.] A couple points, first of all I did not know that hot dogs have been getting shorter.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (46:21):</strong> Me neither.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (46:22):</strong> And it's being incorporated into the inflation data. So all—</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (46:25):</strong> This is good to know.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (46:25):</strong> All the people complaining about shrinkflation, I guess it is mitigated to some—</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (46:30):</strong> They're aware of it.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (46:32):</strong> Yeah, exactly. And then the other thing I would say is I thought the point Bill was making about the loss of granularity in the data was really important. So the idea of getting to the tails of the distribution or certain minorities, and the reason I say that is because we've been seeing a lot of regional and social variation in a lot of these consumer surveys. So obviously people who are poorer have been feeling terrible during the days of high inflation. And people who are rich feel pretty good, but, also inflation in Florida has been higher than elsewhere in the country. So I think it does become more important to get really, really specific with some of these statistics as we see those differences increase.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (47:18):</strong> It's really interesting to me to think about government, high quality government data as this public good and try to imagine—</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (47:28):</strong> Infrastructure, right?</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (47:29):</strong> Infrastructure and try to imagine the amount of economic activity that exists because this thing is offered for free that people don't have to pay for. And obviously in the investing world, there's a tremendous amount of interest in all this, but it's obviously not just the investing world. And so all of these questions, whether you're starting a business or whatever it is, on some level, you can do because there is consistent trustworthy data. And the thought of that going away and what I imagine would happen is, yeah, sure you'd have private versions of varying quality that would try to replace it and that exists today. There's private measures of inflation, et cetera. But that would start to deteriorate the idea of there being a gold standard. And so then you hear it's like, oh, oh, we needed to find a few more million dollars to pay the budget of the survey collectors. How many billions are riding on that few extra millions? How many? Hundreds of billions in activity. So it's just really interesting. And then his thing, explanation at the end, why survey collection for something like this makes sense to do as a trained job. And even the subjectivity of like, are you working and what does that mean and et cetera. It's really interesting to think about why it's not trivial to just send out a survey or send out a high schooler or send out a volunteer or something like that.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (48:53):</strong> Absolutely.

We are also looking for more information on access to and use of IDRS. \n\nAs we shared in the first installment in the series, in early February, DOGE officials entered the Treasury and the IRS and acquired access to some degree of sensitive information. Since then, many DOGE personnel have transitioned into formal roles within these agencies, embedded as federal employees –  some through political appointments, others via opaque hiring mechanisms. The current situation involves two prongs. First, concerns exist that DOGE is seeking access across a range of federal government data systems, including those of the Social Security Administration and the IRS, potentially using the latter not for legitimate tax enforcement, but for political purposes  Second, while IRS system modernization is promoted as a positive technical advancement, this may serve as a means to expand surveillance and violate data privacy laws and protections. While integrating federal data systems may seem efficient, those barriers exist because they prevent the weaponization of data against the public.\n\nThis investigation peels back the layers of the power of the technological infrastructure at the IRS.  In the first piece, we demonstrated the importance of the IRS within the US government system and the potential for surveillance and control. In this piece, we reveal what we know about new tech activities under the guise of modernization and how these differ from the IRS's decades-long operational history. To better appreciate the gravity of these actions, we also examine the IRS’s institutional knowledge embedded in its extremely experienced civil service employees and the agency’s historical context that DOGE has been determined to steamroll and ignore.\n\nDespite our in-depth reporting efforts, the deliberate opacity surrounding DOGE’s actions and plans may be the most disturbing aspect. To truly grasp the scope of their intervention, we need more information - most crucially, their data access and usage (if that’s you, send us a signal DM!). Yet even in this information vacuum, we already know quite a lot about these systems and the tremendous power that comes with controlling the IRS's vast infrastructure.\n\nLet's first examine what we know about DOGE's actions and motivations before exploring how they diverge from the institution's history and their potential implications.\n\nDOGE’s initial rhetoric was full of grand promises about modernization, but their immediate priority quickly revealed itself: securing unprecedented access to sensitive taxpayer data. The reality is DOGE now wields access to the Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS) - a system which enables IRS employees to have instantaneous visual access to centralized digital records that contain all tax-related information for individuals or business entities managed through the IRS's legacy systems, many of which still rely on COBOL programming (more on this later). Who is associated with DOGE and has access to this system, and whether they are political appointees or hired in the civil service, is shrouded in secrecy. There is the potential that, regardless of their employment status, DOGE staff may now have access that exceeds what most IRS career civil servants—whose roles actually require access to taxpayer information—are allowed, let alone political appointees.\n\nTreasury officials have claimed that DOGE wasn’t given “broad access” to the IDRS or that the access is \"anonymized\" or, in some cases, \"read-only.\" These claims ring hollow given the absence of verifiable security protocols or independent oversight. Besides, even if the DOGE’s access was technically limited, there are serious risks associated with this level of access. The lack of transparency regarding data handling is particularly concerning, as staff have reported to Nathan Tankus from early on in the payments crisis that they have no designated authority left within the Treasury to whom they can safely report security protocol breaches.\n\nWhile the Internal Revenue Code provides robust protections for taxpayer data through Section 6103, which establishes confidentiality with strict penalties for violations and permits access and sharing only under specific, explicit circumstances, we cannot verify that DOGE officials comply with these rules. This oversight gap is especially troubling as they prepare to undertake their next ambitious project: a complete rewrite of legacy systems written in Assembly Code and COBOL - programming languages that form the foundation of many critical government functions.\n\n\nThe COBOL Gambit\n\nIt’s important to note that IRS modernization was underway long before DOGE arrived. The agency has spent years attempting to upgrade legacy systems and gradually phase out older programming languages like COBOL. What DOGE is attempting is not modernization in principle, but modernization at reckless speed, divorced from institutional knowledge and technical prudence.\n\nWired Reporting indicates an alarmingly naive plan to convert decades of critical COBOL code to Java through a 30-day “hackathon”, yet the true scope and timeline of this risky undertaking remain opaque. While the project's exact details are murky, their messaging suggests an unprecedented urgency in modernization efforts. In a March FOX News appearance, Sam Corcos (representing DOGE), alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant, launched targeted criticisms of the IRS's legacy systems. Bessent amplified these claims, declaring on social media that the IRS modernization program lags 35 years behind schedule. Corcos is now a Treasury political appointee who serves as the agency’s Chief Information Officer. A career civil servant previously held that role. \n\nThis rushed rhetoric perfectly exemplifies DOGE's toxic combination of technical hubris and institutional recklessness. Despite repeated inquiries from oversight bodies and the press and urgent warnings from veteran civil servants, Treasury and the IRS maintain radio silence on the details of this unprecedented system overhaul, keeping taxpayers and Congress blind to changes that could potentially devastate America's tax infrastructure.\n\n\nA History of “Modernization” and What We’ve Already Tried\n\nModernizing the IRS or any current government system is not a one-time software upgrade; it’s a multiyear institutional overhaul requiring stable funding, cross-agency coordination, and continuous technical labor. It also means maintaining dual systems for extended periods to ensure continuity for internal operations and taxpayer use, which is an expensive but necessary measure. What failed in the past wasn’t the vision of modernization but the refusal to consistently fund and maintain it. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), and the National Taxpayer Advocate have all stated the same thing for years: the IRS cannot modernize without multi-year, predictable investments.\n\nGAO reports dating back to the early 2000s have flagged the absence of long-term funding as an impediment to the agency’s modernization goals. The National Taxpayer Advocate has echoed this repeatedly, noting in a 2019 report that the IRS’s Business Systems Modernization program was delayed not by poor planning, but by the piecemeal and inconsistent nature of congressional appropriations. This is not a controversial opinion by any stretch. In fact, the private sector consistently emphasizes multi-year stable funding as a necessary condition for most projects, especially large-scale IT initiatives. There are many examples of multi-year stable funding being the prerequisite for success. JP Morgan invested over $12 billion every year for many years, resulting in the successful modernization of legacy systems and the development of new digital banking platforms.\n\nThe IRS's technology investment funding has seen many ups and downs since Congress's establishment of the Information Technology Investment Account in FY 1997. These funding levels fall far short of what private companies spend on system improvements, despite government agencies serving millions more people and facing higher costs and consequences of service disruptions. The spending categories vary over the years, but we can consistently identify the Business Systems Modernization category that clearly shows fluctuating modernization spending between 2006 and 2022. Before the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding in 2023, business system modernization spending peaked at $468 million (2024 $) in 2011 and reached its lowest point at $309 million (2024 $) in 2018. Following the IRA allocation, spending increased dramatically to $926 million (2024 $) in 2023 and $1.3 billion (current $) in 2024 for system modernization, not including Direct File and certain other specific expenditures.\n\nAgency staff we interviewed recognized this need for stable multi-year funding. Many expressed appreciation for the increased IRA spending and advocated for ways to maintain higher funding levels even after the IRA funds expire, noting that this influx had been instrumental in advancing several critical projects. Despite these challenges and contrary to DOGE's positioning as pioneers in recognizing the IRS's technological needs, the reality is that the agency has been actively pursuing modernization for over six decades. As we said earlier, there have been mixed results, not because of government inertia but because of political neglect and chronic underfunding.\n\nBeyond the funding and political challenges we discuss above, there is a fundamental misunderstanding about what IRS modernization entails - specifically, which aspects need modernization, the best path forward, and which elements have already been acknowledged and are being addressed versus what new components DOGE is introducing. \n\n\nWhat does modernizing the IRS entail? \n\nAt its core, IRS modernization represents an overhaul of technical infrastructure and taxpayer services. This approach addresses both internal operations and public-facing capabilities. Like many other organizations with legacy systems, the IRS faced a major IT challenge: the Y2K project - a massive undertaking to address the problem with the year 2000. This issue stemmed from the way dates were stored in computer systems, using two digits for the year instead of four, which meant that when the calendar turned to 2000, systems might interpret \"00\" as 1900 rather than 2000. A more recent example of modernization effort on the public-facing side is the introduction of Direct File, which was launched as a pilot program in 2024 to offer eligible taxpayers a free, government-provided tax filing option that simplifies the process and eliminates the need for third-party software.\n\nBut for the most part, the IRS has focused on modernizing its core infrastructure by gradually replacing COBOL and Assembly Language Code systems, especially within the Individual Master File (IMF). The IMF is the oldest operating database in the federal government, conceptualized in 1959 and developed in 1962 using Assembly Language Code and COBOL. IMF remains the authoritative system for tracking every individual taxpayer’s account activity: income, credits, payments, and refunds. Legacy systems written in COBOL and Assembly Language—many still operational—form the backbone of tax processing infrastructure. While DOGE officials claim to be replacing Assembly code with Java, COBOL-based systems were reportedly being migrated to new compilers or systems known as RM/COBOL which was also being implemented at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. A major advantage of RM/COBOLis that it makes the code platform agnostic, allowing it to run on platforms other than large powerful computing systems such as mainframes. To be clear, the details that have come out about DOGE’s efforts are murky and contradictory while it is difficult to get clarity on what exactly they are either doing, or even claiming to do.\n\nThe IRS has been planning and implementing a transition away from the original COBOL for over 20 years. That initiative, known as the Customer Account Data Engine (CADE), was launched in 2000 to replace the IMF and deliver a faster, more flexible system that could support real-time processing. According to a 2024 Congressional Research Service Report, CADE 1 ran into early trouble - delays, vendor issues, scope creep - and was shelved in 2009. Its successor, CADE 2, showed more promise but stalled, slowed by unstable funding and shifting political priorities.  Nevertheless, progress has occurred. According to a GAO report from March 2023, the IRS had completed major components of the Individual Tax Processing Engine and was preparing CADE 2 for broader testing. \n\nThese achievements remain partial, however, as modernization requires more than a one-time software upgrade. While DOGE may present this process as merely inefficient and project that they can do this better in a much shorter time, that is likely impossible. The IRS systems involve layers of complexities that come with operating at such a scale. There are intricate issues that require years of institutional knowledge - intimate understanding of the system in the context of the IRS and not just the expert technical know-how that some DOGE staffers may possess.\n\nAs Nathan has covered in his previous reporting on the Treasury payments system, the complexity of COBOL systems is widely misunderstood in general discourse and within modern tech industries. He explains: \"The issue with understanding and grasping a COBOL system is not knowing COBOL, as a programming language, in the abstract... The issue is understanding the specific physical limitations of the system, the way that it interacts with the 'Business Logic' of the code, and a million other contextual factors.\" This shows why contextual and institutional knowledge is crucial. Modernizing these COBOL systems requires more than mere language syntax fluency. These systems have developed intricate internal business logics that constitute vital institutional knowledge. Consequently, retaining engineers and staff who possess this knowledge and can train new engineers familiar with COBOL is an integral part of any successful modernization process.\n\nWhy this contextual knowledge matters is easily exemplified by the story behind a widespread misconception about social security beneficiaries. Contrary to claims amplified by Elon Musk, thousands of deceased individuals are not receiving benefits. The reality is far more mundane: early COBOL dialects handled null values poorly, so when someone applied for social security with a missing birth date, engineers implemented a specific date as a placeholder. They chose May 20, 1875 - the anniversary of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures' creation. Thus, while records might appear to show 150-year-old people receiving payments, the reality is entirely different and far less sensational. Yet, as Notes on the Crises covered in late April, these misconceptions have had profound consequences as DOGE moved millions of people to Social Security Administration’s “Death Master File”\n\nThis context of chronic and inconsistent funding, as well as the need for institutional knowledge, matters. DOGE now positions itself as the savior of an intentionally starved system. However, they’re doing so without the humility or historical understanding that modernization requires.\n\nThe challenges of modernization are not limited to external factors. IRS career staff we spoke with described a deep internal tension: while many recognize the agency’s outdated infrastructure, they’ve also grown wary, if not defensive, about change. This defensiveness isn’t irrational. The civil service has kept the IRS running despite a decades-long war of attrition, where budget cuts and political attacks have left it operating under siege. Staff described a churn of political appointees at Treasury arriving every few years, launching ambitious reform plans, and then departing before implementation, leaving half-built systems and institutional fatigue in their wake.\n\nThis constant disruption has created a culture that prizes internal stability, process, and procedure,  sometimes to a fault. As some staff acknowledged, parts of the agency have accumulated administrative bloat and redundancies over time, not because of modernization but due to the uneven political targeting of different IRS functions. Over the past few decades, enforcement divisions, taxpayer assistance programs, and IT infrastructure have all faced rolling waves of political scrutiny and budget cuts, while other areas remained untouched. This has created a patchwork organizational structure, where some offices are understaffed, while others carry redundant roles that once served as safeguards against chronic instability. \n\nThis raises a deeper question: if the IRS is essential political infrastructure and central to the functioning of the entire fiscal state, should it be subject to annual political fights over appropriations at all? Modernization can’t succeed if it remains hostage to short-term political cycles. What’s needed is structural commitment: stable funding, institutional continuity, and governance mechanisms that treat the IRS not as a punching bag, but as core democratic infrastructure. DOGE’s narrative ignores decades of defunded effort, bureaucratic workarounds, and congressional gridlock and pretends modernization failure was solely a product of technical incompetence rather than political constraint.\n\n\nLessons from the VA, the 1985 Tax Season, and DOGE’s “MUNCHABLE” Debacle\n\nModernization done right is incremental, transparent, and cautious. One of the clearest historical lessons comes from the IRS itself. In 1985, a rushed update to its computing system caused one of the worst tax seasons in U.S. history. Refunds were delayed for months. Erroneous notices were mailed to millions of Americans. Lines at local IRS offices stretched out the door. Congress was flooded with constituent complaints, and the crisis led to a series of internal audits and public hearings. That episode became known as the “tax season from hell.” It was a cautionary tale about the risks of rushed reform - an example of how modernization without governance can backfire. \n\nRecent events at other agencies have already demonstrated the dangers of hasty implementation. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, a DOGE staffer rapidly developed an AI tool to identify supposedly \"non-essential\" private company services, labeling them as \"MUNCHABLE.\" This resulted in the termination of nearly 600 contracts. When confronted about the errors, the DOGE staffer dismissed concerns, telling ProPublica, \"I’m sure mistakes were made. Mistakes are always made.\" The consequences of this cavalier approach proved severe. Among the terminated contracts were truly essential services, including maintenance for a gene sequencing device crucial for cancer treatment research, blood sample analysis for VA research projects, and tools designed to enhance nursing care quality.\n\nWith DOGE’s entrance into the IRS, the specter of catastrophic system-wide failure certainly looms large. The cautionary tale of 1985 still haunts the IRS. Given today's exponentially more complex tax systems and transaction volumes, DOGE's aggressive timeline and contempt for institutional knowledge could trigger a meltdown that makes 1985 look like a minor glitch.  IRS staff we interviewed described the MUNCHABLE episode as a “canary in the coal mine” for what could happen if similar tools were unleashed on taxpayer data or IRS operations.\n\nThe IRS cannot afford such recklessness. A single misstep in the system that processes refunds, verifies identity, or tracks withholding could delay paychecks, trigger false audits, or compromise vast swaths of sensitive personal data. DOGE’s insistence on speed and dismissal of internal IRS expertise doesn’t just increase the risk of failure. It makes failure all but inevitable.\n\nMeanwhile, additional risks have emerged around DOGE’s broader digital ambitions. Multiple sources flagged DOGE’s parallel effort to develop a “mega API” - a centralized interface intended to integrate IRS data with other federal databases. While framed as an efficiency tool, staff expressed alarm that it could enable cross-agency data sharing without adequate safeguards, including possible tracking of migrant populations, nonprofit activity, and union operations. These concerns echo broader patterns in administrative surveillance, where modernization rhetoric has historically masked new capacities for control. There are also growing concerns from staff about undocumented system changes and the possible removal of legacy records, raising alarms about data governance, audit integrity, and long-term institutional continuity. Thus far, DOGE has declined to respond to multiple FOIA requests or provide detailed documentation of these efforts, citing national security and cybersecurity exemptions. As oversight bodies begin to take notice, the opacity itself has become a warning sign.\n\nFinally, while DOGE insists their mission is public service, several technologists and policy staff we spoke with raised red flags about the expanding role of private contractors, especially high-profile firms like Palantir. Though not formally disclosed, report  suggest Palantir may be involved in early-stage backend integration or pilot analysis projects. If true, this marks a significant shift in how IRS data is governed and who has access to the informational backbone of the American tax system.\n\n\nWhat Real Reform Requires: Governance, Continuity, and Public Infrastructure\n\nThere’s no question that the IRS needs modernization. A progressive vision of IRS reform begins with a simple premise: public systems should be built to serve the public, not to impress venture capitalists or mimic the latest private-sector trends. That means modernization must be led by public interest technologists, not external disruptors with limited institutional knowledge and no stake in long-term stewardship. It also means investing in people, not just software. One of DOGE’s most dangerous moves has been to sideline or push out experienced IRS staff, including COBOL engineers and IT veterans who understand legacy systems' logic, dependencies, and vulnerabilities. These people are not relics. They are keepers of institutional memory, and any transition plan that ignores their insight risks erasing critical knowledge that cannot be recovered.\n\nModernization must also be incremental and dual-tracked. That means running new systems alongside old ones until full interoperability is confirmed. It requires building in redundancy, not stripping it out. It requires regulatory oversight, including privacy reviews, public documentation, and congressional reporting. And yes, it requires real money - multi-year funding, not patchwork grants or short-term political windfalls. Security concerns around COBOL are real, but they’re not insurmountable. Most are not about the language itself but about hardware constraints, vendor deprecation, and decades of deferred maintenance. TIGTA has noted that while COBOL systems present challenges, many vulnerabilities stem from funding shortfalls for patching and hardware upgrades, not the language itself. These are problems of political will, not just code architecture.","html":"<p><em>This is the second installment in the Notes on the Crises series on the IRS.

Besides, even if the DOGE’s access was technically limited, there are <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/treasury-secretary-bessents-lawlessness-sorry-readers-read-and-write-code-still-seems-in-play/\"><u>serious risks associated with this level of access</u></a>. The lack of transparency regarding data handling is particularly concerning, as staff have <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>reported</u></a> to Nathan Tankus from early on in the payments crisis that they have no designated authority left within the Treasury to whom they can safely report security protocol breaches.</p><p>While the Internal Revenue Code provides robust protections for taxpayer data through<a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/government-entities/federal-state-local-governments/disclosure-laws?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> <u>Section 6103</u></a>, which establishes confidentiality with strict penalties for violations and permits access and sharing only under <strong>specific, explicit circumstances</strong>, we cannot verify that DOGE officials comply with these rules. This oversight gap is especially troubling as they prepare to undertake their next ambitious project: a complete rewrite of legacy systems written in Assembly Code and COBOL - programming languages that form the foundation of many critical government functions.</p><h2 id=\"the-cobol-gambit\"><strong>The COBOL Gambit</strong></h2><p>It’s important to note that IRS modernization was underway long before DOGE arrived. The agency has spent years attempting to upgrade legacy systems and gradually phase out older programming languages like COBOL. What DOGE is attempting is not modernization in principle, but modernization at reckless speed, divorced from institutional knowledge and technical prudence.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hackathon-irs-data-palantir/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Wired Reporting</u></a> indicates an alarmingly naive plan to convert decades of critical COBOL code to Java through a 30-day “hackathon”, yet the true scope and timeline of this risky undertaking remain opaque. While the project's exact details are murky, their messaging suggests an unprecedented urgency in modernization efforts. In a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/doge-deputy-treasury-secretary-dish-crusade-pull-irs-out-its-really-big-hole?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>March FOX News appearance,</u></a> Sam Corcos (representing DOGE), alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant, launched<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/doge-deputy-treasury-secretary-dish-crusade-pull-irs-out-its-really-big-hole?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> targeted criticisms</a> of the IRS's legacy systems. Bessent <a href=\"https://x.com/SeccScotBessent/status/1925641077932904477?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>amplified</u></a> these claims,<a href=\"https://x.com/SeccScotBessent/status/1925641077932904477?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> declaring</a> on social media that the IRS modernization program lags 35 years behind schedule. Corcos is now a Treasury political appointee who serves as the agency’s Chief Information Officer. A career civil servant previously held that role.&nbsp;</p><p>This rushed rhetoric perfectly exemplifies DOGE's toxic combination of technical hubris and institutional recklessness. Despite repeated inquiries from oversight bodies and the press and urgent warnings from veteran civil servants, Treasury and the IRS maintain radio silence on the details of this unprecedented system overhaul, keeping taxpayers and Congress blind to changes that could potentially devastate America's tax infrastructure.</p><h2 id=\"a-history-of-%E2%80%9Cmodernization%E2%80%9D-and-what-we%E2%80%99ve-already-tried\"><strong>A History of “Modernization” and What We’ve Already Tried</strong></h2><p>Modernizing the IRS or any current government system is not a one-time software upgrade; it’s a multiyear institutional overhaul requiring stable funding, cross-agency coordination, and continuous technical labor. It also means maintaining dual systems for extended periods to ensure continuity for internal operations and taxpayer use, which is an expensive but necessary measure. What failed in the past wasn’t the vision of modernization but the refusal to consistently fund and maintain it. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), and the National Taxpayer Advocate have all stated the same thing for years: the IRS cannot modernize without multi-year, predictable investments.</p><p>GAO reports dating back to the early 2000s have flagged the absence of long-term funding as an impediment to the agency’s modernization goals. The National Taxpayer Advocate has echoed this repeatedly, noting in a 2019 <a href=\"https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ARC19_Volume1.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>report</u></a> that the IRS’s Business Systems Modernization program was delayed not by poor planning, but by the piecemeal and inconsistent nature of congressional appropriations. This is not a controversial opinion by any stretch. In fact, the private sector consistently emphasizes multi-year stable funding as a necessary condition for most projects, especially large-scale IT initiatives. There are many examples of multi-year stable funding being the prerequisite for success. JP Morgan invested over<a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/payments/acquiring-and-e-commerce/digitalization-a-strategic-priority?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> $12 billion</u></a> every year for many years, resulting in the successful modernization of legacy systems and the development of new digital banking platforms.</p><p>The IRS's technology investment funding has seen many ups and downs since Congress's establishment of the Information Technology Investment Account in FY 1997. These funding levels fall far short of what private companies spend on system improvements, despite government agencies serving millions more people and facing higher costs and consequences of service disruptions. The spending categories vary over the years, but we can consistently identify the Business Systems Modernization category that clearly shows fluctuating <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-costs-incurred-by-budget-activity-irs-data-book-table-32?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>modernization spending</u></a> between 2006 and 2022. Before the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding in 2023, business system modernization spending peaked at $468 million (2024 $) in 2011 and reached its lowest point at $309 million (2024 $) in 2018. Following the IRA allocation, spending increased dramatically to $926 million (2024 $) in 2023 and $1.3 billion (current $) in 2024 for system modernization, not including Direct File and certain other specific expenditures.</p><p><strong>Agency staff we interviewed</strong> recognized this need for stable multi-year funding. Many expressed appreciation for the increased IRA spending and advocated for ways to maintain higher funding levels even after the IRA funds expire, noting that this influx had been instrumental in advancing several critical projects. Despite these challenges and contrary to DOGE's positioning as pioneers in recognizing the IRS's technological needs, the reality is that the agency has been actively pursuing modernization for over six decades. As we said earlier, there have been mixed results, not because of government inertia but because of <strong>political neglect and chronic underfunding</strong>.</p><p>Beyond the funding and political challenges we discuss above, there is a fundamental misunderstanding about what IRS modernization entails - specifically, which aspects need modernization, the best path forward, and which elements have already been acknowledged and are being addressed versus what new components DOGE is introducing.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"what-does-modernizing-the-irs-entail\"><strong>What does modernizing the IRS entail?</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>At its core, IRS modernization represents an overhaul of technical infrastructure and taxpayer services. This approach addresses both internal operations and public-facing capabilities. Like many other organizations with legacy systems, the IRS faced a major IT challenge: the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/fs-99-07.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Y2K project</u></a> - a massive undertaking to address the problem with the year 2000. This issue stemmed from the way dates were stored in computer systems, using two digits for the year instead of four, which meant that when the calendar turned to 2000, systems might interpret \"00\" as 1900 rather than 2000. A more recent example of modernization effort on the public-facing side is the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/filing/irs-direct-file-for-free?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Direct File</u></a>, which was launched as a pilot program in 2024 to offer eligible taxpayers a free, government-provided tax filing option that simplifies the process and eliminates the need for third-party software.</p><p>But for the most part, the IRS has focused on modernizing its core infrastructure by gradually replacing COBOL and Assembly Language Code systems, especially within the Individual Master File (IMF). The IMF is the oldest operating database in the federal government, conceptualized in 1959 and developed in <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/newsroom/irs-history-timeline_march-2019.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>1962</u></a> using Assembly Language Code and COBOL. IMF remains the authoritative system for tracking every individual taxpayer’s account activity: income, credits, payments, and refunds. Legacy systems written in COBOL and Assembly Language—many still operational—form the backbone of tax processing infrastructure. While DOGE officials claim to be replacing Assembly code with Java, COBOL-based systems were reportedly being migrated to new compilers or systems known as RM/COBOL which was also being implemented at the <a href=\"https://oig.treasury.gov/system/files/2024-11/oig25005%20%28508%29.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Bureau of the Fiscal Service</u></a>. A major advantage of RM/COBOLis that it makes the code platform agnostic, allowing it to run on platforms other than large powerful computing systems such as mainframes. To be clear, the details that have come out about DOGE’s efforts are murky and contradictory while it is difficult to get clarity on what exactly they are either doing, or even claiming to do.</p><p>The IRS has been <a href=\"https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF12525.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">planning and implementing</a> a transition away from the original COBOL for over 20 years. That initiative, known as the Customer Account Data Engine (CADE), was launched in 2000 to replace the IMF and deliver a faster, more flexible system that could support real-time processing. According to a <a href=\"https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF12525.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>2024 Congressional Research Service Report</u></a>, CADE 1 ran into early trouble - delays, vendor issues, scope creep - and was shelved in 2009. Its successor, CADE 2, showed more promise but stalled, slowed by unstable funding and shifting political priorities.&nbsp; Nevertheless, progress has occurred. According to a<u> </u><a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106566.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>GAO report</u></a><u> from March 2023</u>, the IRS had completed major components of the Individual Tax Processing Engine and was preparing CADE 2 for broader testing.&nbsp;</p><p>These achievements remain partial, however, as modernization requires more than a one-time software upgrade. While DOGE may present this process as merely inefficient and project that they can do this better in a much shorter time, <strong>that is likely impossible</strong>. The IRS systems involve layers of complexities that come with operating at such a scale. There are intricate issues that require years of institutional knowledge - intimate understanding of the system in the context of the IRS and not just the expert technical know-how that some DOGE staffers may possess.</p><p>As Nathan has<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"> covered</a> in his previous <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>reporting</u></a> on the Treasury payments system, the complexity of COBOL systems is widely misunderstood in general discourse and within modern tech industries. He explains: \"The issue with understanding and grasping a COBOL system is not knowing COBOL, as a programming language, in the abstract... The issue is understanding the specific physical limitations of the system, the way that it interacts with the 'Business Logic' of the code, and a million other contextual factors.\" This shows why contextual and institutional knowledge is crucial. Modernizing these COBOL systems requires more than mere language syntax fluency. These systems <strong>have developed intricate internal business logics that constitute vital institutional knowledge</strong>. Consequently, retaining engineers and staff who possess this knowledge and can train new engineers familiar with COBOL is an integral part of any successful modernization process.</p><p>Why this contextual knowledge matters is easily exemplified by the story behind a widespread misconception about social security beneficiaries. Contrary to claims<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891557463377490431?lang=en&ref=crisesnotes.com\"> <u>amplified</u></a> by Elon Musk, thousands of deceased individuals are not receiving benefits. The reality is far more mundane: early COBOL dialects handled null values poorly, so when someone applied for social security with a missing birth date, engineers implemented a specific date as a placeholder. They chose <a href=\"https://news.stthomas.edu/in-the-news-manjeet-rege-on-the-computer-programming-language-used-by-the-social-security-administration/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>May 20, 1875</u></a> - the anniversary of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures' creation. Thus, while records might appear to show 150-year-old people receiving payments, the reality is entirely different and far less sensational. Yet, as <em>Notes on the Crises</em> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-crisis-at-social-security-illustrates-elon-musk-and-doges-plan-explode-the-number-and-severity-of-improper-payments/\"><u>covered in late April</u></a>, these misconceptions have had profound consequences as DOGE moved millions of people to Social Security Administration’s “Death Master File”</p><p>This context of <strong>chronic and inconsistent funding</strong>, as well as the <strong>need for institutional knowledge</strong>, matters. DOGE now positions itself as the savior of an intentionally starved system. However, they’re doing so without the <strong>humility or historical understanding that modernization requires</strong>.</p><p>The challenges of modernization are not limited to external factors.<strong> IRS career staff we spoke with described a deep internal tension</strong>: while many recognize the agency’s outdated infrastructure, they’ve also grown wary, if not defensive, about change. This defensiveness isn’t irrational. The civil service has kept the IRS running despite a decades-long war of attrition, where budget cuts and political attacks have left it operating under siege. Staff described a churn of political appointees at Treasury arriving every few years, launching ambitious reform plans, and then departing before implementation, leaving half-built systems and institutional fatigue in their wake.</p><p>This constant disruption has created a culture that <strong>prizes internal stability, process, and procedure</strong>,&nbsp; sometimes to a fault. As some staff acknowledged, parts of the agency have accumulated administrative bloat and redundancies over time, not <strong>because of modernization but due to the uneven political targeting of different IRS functions</strong>. Over the past few decades, enforcement divisions, taxpayer assistance programs, and IT infrastructure have all faced rolling waves of political scrutiny and budget cuts, while other areas remained untouched. This has created a patchwork organizational structure, where some offices are understaffed, while others carry redundant roles that once served as safeguards against chronic instability.&nbsp;</p><p>This raises a deeper question: if the IRS is essential political infrastructure and central to the functioning of the entire fiscal state, should it be subject to annual political fights over appropriations at all? Modernization can’t succeed if it remains hostage to short-term political cycles. What’s needed is structural commitment: stable funding, institutional continuity, and governance mechanisms that treat the IRS not as a punching bag, but as core democratic infrastructure. DOGE’s narrative ignores decades of defunded effort, bureaucratic workarounds, and congressional gridlock and pretends modernization failure was solely a product of technical incompetence rather than political constraint.</p><h2 id=\"lessons-from-the-va-the-1985-tax-season-and-doge%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cmunchable%E2%80%9D-debacle\"><strong>Lessons from the VA, the 1985 Tax Season, and DOGE’s “MUNCHABLE” Debacle</strong></h2><p>Modernization done right is incremental, transparent, and cautious. One of the clearest historical lessons comes from the IRS itself. In 1985, a rushed update to its computing system caused one of the worst tax seasons in U.S. history. Refunds were delayed for months. Erroneous notices were mailed to millions of Americans. Lines at local IRS offices stretched out the door. Congress was flooded with constituent complaints, and the crisis led to a series of internal audits and public hearings. That episode became known as the <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/5248369-a-warning-from-1985-the-tax-season-from-hell/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><strong><u>tax season from hell</u></strong></a><strong>.”</strong> It was a cautionary tale about the risks of rushed reform - an example of how modernization without governance can backfire.&nbsp;</p><p>Recent events at other agencies have already demonstrated the dangers of hasty implementation. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, a DOGE staffer rapidly developed an AI tool to identify supposedly \"non-essential\" private company services, labeling them as \"MUNCHABLE.\" This resulted in the termination of nearly 600 contracts. When confronted about the errors, the DOGE staffer dismissed concerns, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-doge-veterans-affairs-ai-contracts-health-care?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>telling</u> </a>ProPublica, \"I’m sure mistakes were made. Mistakes are always made.\" The consequences of this cavalier approach proved severe. Among the terminated contracts were truly essential services, including maintenance for a gene sequencing device crucial for cancer treatment research, blood sample analysis for VA research projects, and tools designed to enhance nursing care quality.</p><p>With DOGE’s entrance into the IRS, the specter of <strong>catastrophic system-wide failure certainly looms large</strong>. The cautionary tale of 1985 still haunts the IRS. Given today's exponentially more complex tax systems and transaction volumes, DOGE's aggressive timeline and contempt for institutional knowledge could trigger a meltdown that <strong>makes 1985 look like a minor glitch</strong>.&nbsp; IRS staff <strong>we interviewed described the MUNCHABLE episode as a “canary in the coal mine”</strong> for what could happen if similar tools were unleashed on taxpayer data or IRS operations.</p><p>The IRS cannot afford such recklessness. A single misstep in the system that processes refunds, verifies identity, or tracks withholding could delay paychecks, trigger false audits, or compromise vast swaths of sensitive personal data. DOGE’s insistence on speed and dismissal of internal IRS expertise doesn’t just increase the risk of failure. It makes failure all but inevitable.</p><p>Meanwhile, additional risks have emerged around DOGE’s broader digital ambitions. Multiple sources flagged DOGE’s parallel effort to develop a “<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hackathon-irs-data-palantir/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>mega API”</u></a> - a centralized interface intended to integrate IRS data with other federal databases. While framed as an efficiency tool, staff expressed alarm that it could enable cross-agency data sharing without adequate safeguards, including possible tracking of migrant populations, nonprofit activity, and union operations. These concerns echo broader patterns in administrative surveillance, where <strong>modernization rhetoric has historically masked new capacities for control</strong>. There are also growing concerns from staff about <strong>undocumented system changes and the possible removal of legacy records</strong>, raising alarms about data governance, audit integrity, and long-term institutional continuity. Thus far, DOGE has declined to respond to multiple FOIA requests or provide detailed documentation of these efforts, citing national security and cybersecurity exemptions. As oversight bodies begin to take notice, the opacity itself has become a warning sign.</p><p>Finally, while DOGE insists their mission is public service, several technologists and policy staff we spoke with raised red flags about the expanding role of private contractors, especially high-profile firms like Palantir. Though not formally disclosed, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-doge-irs-mega-api-data/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>report</u></a>&nbsp; suggest Palantir may be involved in early-stage backend integration or pilot analysis projects. If true, this marks a significant shift in how IRS data is governed and who has access to the informational backbone of the American tax system.</p><h2 id=\"what-real-reform-requires-governance-continuity-and-public-infrastructure\"><strong>What Real Reform Requires: Governance, Continuity, and Public Infrastructure</strong></h2><p>There’s no question that the IRS needs modernization. A progressive vision of IRS reform begins with a simple premise: public systems should be built to serve the public, not to impress venture capitalists or mimic the latest private-sector trends. That means modernization must be led by public interest technologists, not external disruptors with limited institutional knowledge and no stake in long-term stewardship. It also means investing in people, not just software. One of DOGE’s most dangerous moves has been to sideline or push out experienced IRS staff, including COBOL engineers and IT veterans who understand legacy systems' logic, dependencies, and vulnerabilities. These people are not relics. They are keepers of institutional memory, and any transition plan that ignores their insight risks erasing critical knowledge that cannot be recovered.</p><p>Modernization must also be incremental and dual-tracked. That means running new systems alongside old ones until full interoperability is confirmed. It requires building in redundancy, not stripping it out. It requires regulatory oversight, including privacy reviews, public documentation, and congressional reporting. And yes, it requires real money - multi-year funding, not patchwork grants or short-term political windfalls. Security concerns around COBOL are real, but they’re not insurmountable. Most are not about the language itself but about hardware constraints, vendor deprecation, and decades of deferred maintenance. TIGTA has noted that while COBOL systems present challenges, many vulnerabilities stem from funding shortfalls for patching and hardware upgrades, not the language itself. These are problems of political will, not just code architecture.</p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/inside-doges-dangerously-hasty-irs-modernization-plan/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"b36a8bd6-4f96-4934-ab21-63ccaae0fe31","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"68648d9e1693c60001ba646e","reading_time":14}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"June 12","id":"Ghost__Post__684a7989b3542f0001f70a51","title":"The Fiscal State Under Siege: Why People Hate the IRS, and Why You Should Care","slug":"the-fiscal-state-under-siege-why-people-hate-the-irs-and-why-you-should-care","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/06/IRS-series-1.png","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b80808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/dd075/IRS-series-1.png","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/715a6/IRS-series-1.png 398w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/fc129/IRS-series-1.png 796w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/dd075/IRS-series-1.png 1592w","sizes":"(min-width: 1592px) 1592px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/530b5/IRS-series-1.webp 398w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/a621f/IRS-series-1.webp 796w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/09728/IRS-series-1.webp 1592w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1592px) 1592px, 100vw"}]},"width":1592,"height":830}}},"excerpt":"How Trump, DOGE, and Project 2025 Are Turning the IRS Into a Tool of Authoritarian Rule\n\n\n\nEditor’s Introduction: Hello readers, it's Nathan Tankus and I am very happy to bring to you the first in a long multi-part series on the IRS spearheaded by Anisha Steephen.

And I love taxes. From mid-2021 through January 2025, I worked at the U.S. Treasury. Among many roles during my time there, I spent some time in the Office of Tax Policy, where I helped implement the tax provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. This is the first in a Notes on the Crises series that I, along with others, will be tackling about the IRS and taxes. In the weeks ahead, we’ll explore the agency transformation and the House Republicans’ disastrous reconciliation package that is unfolding right now. But first, we have to understand what taxation is — and why it’s always been about power. What’s below is an overview, then we will go in depth on many aspects as the series evolves. \n\n\nProject 2025 and the Structural Takeover\n\nIf you’ve read Project 2025, you know there was a plan. The authors laid out a blueprint to bring the IRS under greater executive control by infiltrating political appointees, gutting the civil service, and pushing an ambitious slate of regressive tax policies through Congress.\n\nWell, it’s happening.\n\nThe first public signal of chaos at the IRS came on February 17 when the Associated Press reported that DOGE was seeking access to the IRS’s Integrated Data Retrieval System—one of the most sensitive (I would argue the most sensitive) databases of personal information in the federal government. Privacy experts and lawmakers immediately sounded the alarm that this was no ordinary tech integration. It was a structural takeover.\n\nSince then, the chaos has only multiplied to include leadership purges, workforce cuts, and a DOGE-hosted IRS “hackathon.” These aren’t isolated incidents. They reflect a strategic campaign to transform the IRS into a politically partisan enforcement mechanism and a lever of executive power. \n\nThis goes far beyond just administrative disorder that is expected with any administration change, which would be concerning enough on its own. This is a systematic takeover of the federal government’s fiscal core. What’s at stake is not only the architecture of how the state sees, collects, and allocates public resources, but whether a functioning democracy can survive without it.\n\n\nWhy the IRS Matters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IRS sits at the center of the federal government’s fiscal architecture. As the financial nexus between the state and its residents, it facilitates the movement of trillions of dollars through the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. It enforces tax law, detects fraud, and has the authority to audit the ultra-wealthy to crack down on tax evasion that enables them to become even richer. The IRS does not write tax law, but enforces the code passed by Congress. Confusing the IRS with the architects of tax policy lets lawmakers off the hook. Its role is administrative, not factional, and that’s precisely what makes it so powerful. \n\nBut its role goes deeper. The IRS is not merely a tool of extraction: it can be a mechanism for redistribution, stabilization, and democratic investment. In Fiscal Year 2024, the IRS collected $4.9 trillion in taxes, which comprised 96% of total government revenue and was equivalent to 17% of GDP that year. When governed with public purpose, the IRS powers the fiscal machinery that sustains democracy itself by facilitating the spending that funds housing, healthcare, climate action, education, and income support that reaches millions. For example, In 2021 the IRS delivered over $100 billion in expanded Child Tax Credit payments. \n\nAt the beginning of this piece, when I say I love the IRS and taxes, I'm referring to these core social responsibilities, not to institutional permanence or bureaucratic tradition. The IRS is a vital institution, but it is not above critique. Studying it is essential, yet we must resist the impulse toward institutional reverence. This is especially important now, as agencies like the IRS grow increasingly susceptible to authoritarian encroachment. These institutions are not immutable moral authorities; they are only as democratic as the political forces that shape and control them.\n\nTo control the IRS is to control the operating system of the American state. That is precisely what makes this moment so dangerous. DOGE isn’t simply trying to dismantle the agency. It is trying to capture and rewire the IRS into a vehicle for executive dominance, privatized tax enforcement, and algorithmic control over public infrastructure. \n\nThis is not about eliminating bureaucracy, fraud, waste, or abuse. It’s about repurposing it to serve a new model of power and breaking the chain of democratic accountability between Congress, the law, and the public.  \n\n\nWhat Taxes Actually Are (And Why They’ve Always Been About Power and Control)\n\nTaxes are often portrayed as technocratic minutiae of statecraft—matters best left to accountants, economists, and congressional scorekeepers. But in truth, they are the lifeblood of state power.\n\nIn theory, taxes facilitate the provision of public goods and services: everything from national defense and infrastructure to schools and our social safety nets. Taxes come in many forms, including income taxes (on wages, salaries, and capital gains), consumption taxes (such as sales and excise taxes), property taxes, and corporate taxes. Taxes may be direct or indirect, progressive or regressive, visible or embedded in prices. No matter how they’re designed, taxes define the boundaries between the state and its people and the contours of political life. They determine who owes what to whom, and who gets to decide.\n\nThroughout history, taxation has functioned not merely as a means to help resource the government but as an instrument of visibility and control. Political theorist James C. Scott argued that states are often more motivated to tax in order to render societies legible in order to govern. Tax systems compel individuals to make themselves known to the state: declaring income, disclosing assets, and proving eligibility for social benefits. In doing so, they map economic life and assign political meaning to it. Taxes and tax policies create the conditions under which labor is counted, whose wealth is protected, and whose lives are monitored, audited, or excluded.\n\nPolitical economists have long recognized this dual function. Adam Smith, in The Wealth of Nations, emphasized that the sovereign’s survival depended on the ability to raise taxes efficiently and equitably. Marx saw taxation as one of many battlefields where class conflict played out over the distribution of social surplus. In the turmoil of the twentieth century, John Maynard Keynes emphasized taxation was- or could be- a tool for macroeconomic stabilization.  Piketty, working in the twenty-first century, warns that progressive taxation is essential to preventing the return of entrenched oligarchies. Legal realist Robert Hale, writing in the 1920s, argued that all income and property rights are upheld through coercive legal rules—and therefore taxation is not an intrusion on freedom but a foundational mechanism by which the state structures economic life. Even libertarians, though begrudgingly, concede taxation’s necessity to facilitate minimal state functions. These views span ideological terrain, but converge on one point: taxation is not merely math. It is a political infrastructure. It is how the state exercises power, asserts authority, and signals its priorities. In short, it is governance in its most distilled form.\n\n\nThe State’s Obligation to Its People \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxation defines what the state can see and, by extension, what it can control. In a democracy, that visibility is supposed to be reciprocal. If the state can see you, you should be able to shape what the state does in return. That mutual recognition is the only viable foundation of our social contract with the State. The American Colonists in their revolution understood this intuitively. Their demand was not against taxation itself, but against taxation without representation—a refusal to cede fiscal power to distant, unaccountable authorities. The colonists clashed with their British imperial counterparts and insisted that taxation be tethered to the democratic voice.\n\nAnd yet, U.S. tax policy has long prioritized extraction over equity. In its early years, the republic relied heavily on regressive tariffs—taxes on imported goods that disproportionately burdened consumers, especially the poor, while shielding elites. For example, the 1790s federal revenue system was primarily concentrated on duties for goods like sugar, salt, and textiles, staples that made up a large share of working-class consumption. Meanwhile, wealthy landowners and merchants, who benefited from domestic production and trade, paid little by comparison.\n\nEfforts to create a more equitable fiscal order, like those proposed by Thomas Paine, were largely ignored. Paine, recognizing the dangers of concentrated wealth, advocated for what we would now call a wealth tax: a 100% marginal tax on estates above a certain threshold. In his view, taxation was not just an instrument of state power—it was a means to dismantle economic hierarchy and protect political equality. The Civil War briefly disrupted the tradition of regressive taxation. The Union introduced the first federal income tax, an extraordinary expansion of the Treasury’s infrastructure and fiscal capacity. The ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 made that authority permanent, embedding the principle that those who benefit most from the economic system should contribute proportionally to its upkeep. In theory, it marked a new democratic fiscal compact.\n\nBut in practice, that compact has always been contested by the elite. The U.S. tax system has long operated as a machine of selective visibility. Today, working-class Americans are subject to invasive scrutiny. They must document their income, family structure, and eligibility for basic social benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit. Meanwhile, the wealthy conceal assets in trusts, shell corporations, and offshore accounts. This asymmetry is not accidental: it is a structural feature of the fiscal state, built on political choices about who must be accountable and who is allowed to remain invisible. Taxation, in this system, reinforces hierarchies of obligation where the poor are tethered to bureaucratic surveillance, while the rich rig the system to float above it.\n\nThat class betrayal extends beyond the collection of taxes to how the Federal Government’s budget is designed. While working-class communities are urged to see tax paying as a civic virtue, they receive little in return. The essential services that taxes are (in theory) meant to make possible—public education, housing, and healthcare—remain systematically underinvested. At the same time, public dollars finance militarized policing, mass incarceration, and global warfare. For many Black and brown Americans, paying taxes means giving up purchasing power while governments, corporations, and the wealthy use this country’s fiscal apparatus to sustain a bureaucratic machinery of broader oppression and marginalization. The fiscal system doesn’t just deepen state control over daily life—it entangles citizens in state violence, without offering them protection in return.\n\nThis is why debates over tax policy are never just about money, and why more people should be paying attention. They are about visibility, legitimacy, and power—about who the government chooses to see, to trust, and ultimately, to protect or to punish. The IRS, then, in its role administering tax policy, is not and has never been a neutral bureaucratic entity. It is the institutional expression of political economy—a mechanism that enforces who must justify their presence in the fiscal order. Its failures reflect political choices, but so do its successes. When aligned with democratic goals, the IRS can function as a pillar of economic justice, making visible the invisible, delivering benefits directly to the people, and ensuring that those who extract the most from society contribute their fair share.\n\nTaxation is therefore not just a tool of technocratic administration; it is the terrain of democratic struggle. And while that struggle has always been fraught, today it is perilous. \n\n\nThe IRS and Its Current Political Transformation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IRS, as the institution that we know, took shape during the Civil War, but its modern incarnation grew alongside the rise of the 20th-century administrative state. As federal responsibilities expanded, so did the need for an agency capable of managing the government’s most powerful claim over its citizens: the power to tax. Over the decades, the IRS became both an indispensable and a deeply resented bureaucratic punching bag for anti-government sentiment. Though often blamed for the tax system’s outcomes, the IRS does not write the rules—it enforces the tax code passed by Congress. This administrative role makes it structurally nonpartisan, yet politically vulnerable.\n\nThe IRS is not just another federal agency. It is supposed to enforce tax laws impartially based on statutes passed by Congress. That mandate was tested—and violated—during the Nixon administration. In the early 1970s, President Nixon ordered the IRS to audit his political opponents, civil rights activists, and journalists, weaponizing the agency for personal and ideological retaliation. The resulting scandal led to the creation of Section 7217 of the Internal Revenue Code, which explicitly prohibits executive branch officials, including the president, from interfering in IRS audits or administration. This firewall was designed to safeguard the agency’s independence and, by extension, the democratic legitimacy of the tax system itself.\n\nHowever, the assault on the IRS did not end with Nixon. In the decades that followed, it became a central target of conservative movements intent on dismantling the federal state. The Reagan era marked a turning point. As the gospel of small government and supply-side economics took hold, efforts to defund, discredit, and destabilize the IRS intensified. The 1990s brought relentless anti-tax rhetoric, and the 2010s delivered defunding and institutional decline. Between 2010 and 2022, Congress slashed the IRS budget by over 20%, leading to the loss of more than 20,000 employees (including auditors, investigators, and IT specialists) as basic customer service collapsed under the weight of chronic understaffing.\n\nIn that same period, enforcement against the wealthy all but virtually disappeared. According to economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the top 1% of U.S. earners evaded roughly $160 billion in taxes annually.  Meanwhile, audits of low-income taxpayers, especially those claiming refundable credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit, surged. A 2023 Quarterly Journal of Economics study, using IRS data from 2010 to 2018, found that Black taxpayers were audited at nearly five times the rate of non-Black taxpayers. This wasn’t because they were more likely to commit fraud, but because their returns were simpler and cheaper to audit. During years of budget cuts, the IRS leaned on algorithms that prioritized efficiency over fairness. The result was a classist and racialized audit and enforcement system built for speed and to protect the wealthy. \n\nThe Biden administration hoped to reverse course by restoring the IRS’s capacity to serve the public. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 secured nearly $80 billion in new funding aimed at modernizing technology, rebuilding the workforce, and ensuring that tax enforcement was applied to the wealthy as well as the poor. The New York Times recently reported that the IRS upheld Biden’s pledge to increase audits but only on the wealthy. Those efforts have now largely been halted.\n\nThese decades of targeting the IRS weren’t just an attack on one agency. They were an attack on the state’s ability to govern fairly. A well-resourced IRS is more than a bureaucratic necessity; it is democratic infrastructure. It enables the equal enforcement of the law, the redistribution of wealth, and the delivery of public goods. Fiscal fairness becomes impossible when that capacity is gutted, and democracy becomes performative. The IRS wasn’t neglected by conservatives: it has been meticulously redesigned to concentrate power and wealth along lines of class and race. Its mission was retooled to be less a guardian of the public interest and more a servant of market discipline. \n\nAnd today, that project is entering a new and far more dangerous phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump, DOGE,  and the New Model of Fiscal Control\n\nUnder the Trump administration, DOGE has aggressively intervened in the IRS by seeking access to sensitive taxpayer data, orchestrating mass layoffs, and eliminating public-friendly programs like Direct File. They don’t want to just dismantle the IRS. They want to further rewire it, transforming a civic institution into a political instrument. In this vision, taxation is no longer a shared obligation but a mechanism of ideological enforcement. Surveillance becomes the method, and loyalty to the president the metric. This transformation is rooted in the logic of new public management—a technocratic framework that reshapes public institutions to resemble private firms: lean, automated, data-driven, and detached from democratic accountability. \n\nThis shift doesn’t just weaken the IRS. It bypasses the democratic infrastructure that’s supposed to govern it. What was once a chain of accountability—from lawmaking to enforcement to public benefit—is now being rerouted through executive command and algorithmic control. Under this model, the IRS ceases to be a steward of fiscal democracy and instead morphs into an engine of information extraction: surveilling the public, enforcing hierarchy, and concentrating power.\n\nThe consequences are already visible: the IRS’s agreement to share confidential taxpayer data with ICE has raised alarms about privacy and the agency's role in enforcement beyond taxation; and the threatened revocations of nonprofit status for universities, climate organizations, and racial justice groups—justified under the guise of fiscal scrutiny—are not neutral acts of enforcement. They are party-focused interventions, using the tax code to intimidate critics and constrain dissent. \n\nWe’ve seen this before, and it should scare us. In countries like Hungary and Rwanda, governments have turned tax authorities into instruments of repression—not by banning civil society outright, but by burying it in audits, compliance demands, and legal ambiguity. Bureaucratic coercion becomes a substitute for overt censorship. The United States is now testing the contours of that same strategy: deploying regulatory pressure to erode opposition, cloaking political retaliation in administrative form, and transforming fiscal policy into a weapon of ideological discipline.\n\nWhat’s also being lost in all of this is not just IRS institutional expertise or workforce capacity. It’s the legitimacy of the social contract: the idea that taxation is a collective democratic function. DOGE’s approach echoes a system where data is extracted not to serve the public, but to entrench private and executive power. In this framework, the IRS no longer upholds civic duty, but instead enforces obedience. Public authority remains, but democratic accountability disappears.\n\n\nIf You Control the Tax Code and the IRS, You Control the State and The People\n\nThis isn’t just bureaucratic reshuffling. It’s a battle over the very structure of American democracy. The IRS, as the engine of fiscal governance, is being gutted, rewired, and weaponized. While Congress still (in theory) formally holds the power of the purse, control over how tax laws are enforced and against whom is increasingly shifting to the executive branch. And the tax code, once a tool for potential shared investment, is being further entrenched as a shield for elite impunity.\n\nIf a sitting president can direct the IRS to investigate political enemies, revoke nonprofit status from dissenting institutions, or selectively enforce tax law to reward loyalty, the agency no longer serves the public. It serves power. The slow hollowing of the IRS through funding cuts, staff attrition, and the erosion of norms yields the same result: a weakened institution unable to enforce the law, uphold equity, or hold the powerful to account.\n\nAnd when that happens, the disparities baked into our fiscal system deepen. The rich, already shielded by armies of tax lawyers and offshore vehicles, become even more invisible to enforcement. Meanwhile, the working class, especially Black and brown taxpayers, are subject to increased scrutiny and bureaucratic punishment. When Nixon overstepped, Congress stepped in. But today, a deeply polarized legislature, decades of executive aggrandizement, and a judiciary increasingly deferential to presidential authority have eroded those checks. Now the stakes are higher, not just because of the power being wielded, but because of whom that power targets and whom it protects.\n\nWe are no longer just watching a system decay. We are watching it be consolidated to serve private power, silence dissent, and reverse the very idea of democratic taxation. It’s a constitutional breakdown. If the IRS falls, we won’t just lose an agency; we’ll lose one of the last institutional expressions of democratic obligation. Taxation is not just how we keep a number of key infrastructures running—it is how we declare what we value, who we protect, and who must answer to the public. The IRS reflects that social contract, however imperfectly, and not without deep bias. But unlike some other federal institutions, its mandate remains tenuously anchored in public law and congressional oversight. It is one of the few places where the struggle over fiscal accountability is still active and, for now, structurally possible.\n\nWe don’t need to defend what the IRS has been. We need to fight for what it could be: a mechanism of equity, not control by the elite. And accountability, not surveillance. But if we allow it to collapse—or worse, to be captured for authoritarianism—we may wake up in a country where taxation still exists, but democracy does not.","html":"<h2 id=\"how-trump-doge-and-project-2025-are-turning-the-irs-into-a-tool-of-authoritarian-rule\">How Trump, DOGE, and Project 2025 Are Turning the IRS Into a Tool of Authoritarian Rule</h2><p></p><p><em>Editor’s Introduction: Hello readers, it's Nathan Tankus and I am very happy to bring to you the first in a long multi-part series on the IRS spearheaded by Anisha Steephen.

Legal realist Robert Hale, writing in the 1920s, argued that all income and property rights are upheld through coercive legal rules—and therefore taxation is not an intrusion on freedom but a foundational mechanism by which the state structures economic life. Even libertarians, though begrudgingly, concede taxation’s necessity to facilitate minimal state functions. These views span ideological terrain, but converge on one point: taxation is not merely math. It is a political infrastructure. It is how the state exercises power, asserts authority, and signals its priorities. In short, it is governance in its most distilled form.</p><h3 id=\"the-state%E2%80%99s-obligation-to-its-people\"><strong>The State’s Obligation to Its People&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-grey kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Buy a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>Taxation defines what the state can see and, by extension, what it can control. In a democracy, that visibility is supposed to be reciprocal. If the state can see you, you should be able to shape what the state does in return. That mutual recognition is the only viable foundation of our social contract with the State. The American Colonists in their revolution understood this intuitively. Their demand was not against taxation itself, but against taxation <em>without representation</em>—a refusal to cede fiscal power to distant, unaccountable authorities. The colonists clashed with their British imperial counterparts and insisted that taxation be tethered to the democratic voice.</p><p>And yet, U.S. tax policy has long prioritized extraction over equity. In its early years, the republic relied heavily on regressive tariffs—taxes on imported goods that disproportionately burdened consumers, especially the poor, while shielding elites. For example, the 1790s federal revenue system was primarily concentrated on duties for goods like sugar, salt, and textiles, staples that made up a large share of working-class consumption. Meanwhile, wealthy landowners and merchants, who benefited from domestic production and trade, paid little by comparison.</p><p>Efforts to create a more equitable fiscal order, like those proposed by Thomas Paine, were largely ignored. Paine, recognizing the dangers of concentrated wealth, advocated for what we would now call a wealth tax: a 100% marginal tax on estates above a certain threshold. In his view, taxation was not just an instrument of state power—it was a means to dismantle economic hierarchy and protect political equality. The Civil War briefly disrupted the tradition of regressive taxation. The Union introduced the first federal income tax, an extraordinary expansion of the Treasury’s infrastructure and fiscal capacity. The ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 made that authority permanent, embedding the principle that those who benefit most from the economic system should contribute proportionally to its upkeep. In theory, it marked a new democratic fiscal compact.</p><p>But in practice, that compact has always been contested by the elite. The U.S. tax system has long operated as a machine of <em>selective visibility</em>. Today, working-class Americans are subject to invasive scrutiny. They must document their income, family structure, and eligibility for basic social benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit. Meanwhile, the wealthy conceal assets in trusts, shell corporations, and offshore accounts. This asymmetry is not accidental: it is a structural feature of the fiscal state, built on political choices about who must be accountable and who is allowed to remain invisible. Taxation, in this system, reinforces hierarchies of obligation where the poor are tethered to bureaucratic surveillance, while the rich rig the system to float above it.</p><p>That class betrayal extends beyond the collection of taxes to how the Federal Government’s budget is designed. While working-class communities are urged to see tax paying as a civic virtue, they receive little in return. The essential services that taxes are (in theory) meant to make possible—public education, housing, and healthcare—remain systematically underinvested. At the same time, public dollars finance militarized policing, mass incarceration, and global warfare. For many Black and brown Americans, paying taxes means giving up purchasing power while governments, corporations, and the wealthy use this country’s fiscal apparatus to sustain a bureaucratic machinery of broader oppression and marginalization. The fiscal system doesn’t just deepen state control over daily life—it entangles citizens in state violence, without offering them protection in return.</p><p>This is why debates over tax policy are never just about money, and why more people should be paying attention. They are about visibility, legitimacy, and power—about who the government chooses to see, to trust, and ultimately, to protect or to punish. The IRS, then, in its role administering tax policy, is not and has never been a neutral bureaucratic entity. It is the institutional expression of political economy—a mechanism that enforces who must justify their presence in the fiscal order. Its failures reflect political choices, but so do its successes. When aligned with democratic goals, the IRS can function as a pillar of economic justice, making visible the invisible, delivering benefits directly to the people, and ensuring that those who extract the most from society contribute their fair share.</p><p>Taxation is therefore not just a tool of technocratic administration; <em>it is the terrain of democratic struggle.</em> And while that struggle has always been fraught, today it is perilous.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"the-irs-and-its-current-political-transformation\"><strong>The IRS and Its Current Political Transformation</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-grey kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Buy a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>The IRS, as the institution that we know, took shape during the Civil War, but its modern incarnation grew alongside the rise of the 20th-century administrative state. As federal responsibilities expanded, so did the need for an agency capable of managing the government’s most powerful claim over its citizens: <strong>the power to tax.</strong> Over the decades, the IRS became both an indispensable and a deeply resented bureaucratic punching bag for anti-government sentiment. Though often blamed for the tax system’s outcomes, the IRS does not write the rules—it enforces the tax code passed by Congress. This administrative role makes it structurally nonpartisan, yet politically vulnerable.</p><p>The IRS is not just another federal agency. It is supposed to enforce tax laws impartially based on statutes passed by Congress. That mandate was tested—and violated—during the Nixon administration. In the early 1970s, President Nixon ordered the IRS to audit his political opponents, civil rights activists, and journalists, weaponizing the agency for personal and ideological retaliation. The resulting scandal led to the creation of Section 7217 of the Internal Revenue Code, which explicitly prohibits executive branch officials, including the president, from interfering in IRS audits or administration. This firewall was designed to safeguard the agency’s independence and, by extension, the democratic legitimacy of the tax system itself.</p><p>However, the assault on the IRS did not end with Nixon. In the decades that followed, it became a central target of conservative movements intent on dismantling the federal state. The Reagan era marked a turning point. As the gospel of small government and supply-side economics took hold, efforts to defund, discredit, and destabilize the IRS intensified. The 1990s brought relentless anti-tax rhetoric, and the 2010s delivered defunding and institutional decline. Between 2010 and 2022, Congress <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-irs-was-gutted?ref=crisesnotes.com#:~:text=administration%20of%20Barack%20Obama%2C%20the,Collections%20rebounded\"><u>slashed</u></a> the IRS budget by over 20%, leading to the loss of more than 20,000 employees (including auditors, investigators, and IT specialists) as basic customer service collapsed under the weight of chronic understaffing.</p><p>In that same period, enforcement against the wealthy all but virtually disappeared. According to economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the top 1% of U.S. earners evaded roughly $160 billion in taxes annually.&nbsp; Meanwhile, audits of low-income taxpayers, especially those claiming refundable credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit, surged. A 2023 <em>Quarterly Journal of Economics</em> study, using IRS data from 2010 to 2018, <a href=\"https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/working-paper/measuring-and-mitigating-racial-disparities-tax-audits?ref=crisesnotes.com#:~:text=novel%20partial%20identification%20strategy%20to,%282%29%20targeting%20erroneously%20claimed\"><u>found</u></a> that Black taxpayers were audited at nearly five times the rate of non-Black taxpayers. This wasn’t because they were more likely to commit fraud, but because their returns were simpler and cheaper to audit. During years of budget cuts, the IRS leaned on algorithms that prioritized efficiency over fairness. The result was a classist and racialized audit and enforcement system built for speed and to protect the wealthy.&nbsp;</p><p>The Biden administration hoped to reverse course by restoring the IRS’s capacity to serve the public. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 <a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/irs-thinks-big-about-how-spend-80-billion?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>secured nearly $80 billion</u></a> in new funding aimed at modernizing technology, rebuilding the workforce, and ensuring that tax enforcement was applied to the wealthy as well as the poor. The New York Times recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/upshot/tax-audits-wealthy-biden-trump.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>reported</u></a> that the IRS upheld Biden’s pledge to increase audits but only on the wealthy. Those efforts have now largely been halted.</p><p>These decades of targeting the IRS weren’t just an attack on one agency. They were an attack on the state’s ability to govern fairly. A well-resourced IRS is more than a bureaucratic necessity; it is democratic infrastructure. It enables the equal enforcement of the law, the redistribution of wealth, and the delivery of public goods. Fiscal fairness becomes impossible when that capacity is gutted, and democracy becomes performative. The IRS wasn’t <strong>neglected </strong>by conservatives: it has been meticulously <strong>redesigned </strong>to concentrate power and wealth along lines of class and race. Its mission was <strong>retooled </strong>to be less a guardian of the public interest and more a <strong>servant of market discipline.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>And today, that project is entering a new and far more dangerous phase.</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-grey kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Buy a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<h3 id=\"trump-doge-and-the-new-model-of-fiscal-control\"><strong>Trump, DOGE,&nbsp; and the New Model of Fiscal Control</strong></h3><p>Under the Trump administration, DOGE has aggressively intervened in the IRS by seeking access to sensitive taxpayer data, orchestrating mass layoffs, and eliminating public-friendly programs like <a href=\"https://fas.org/publication/end-of-irs-direct-file/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Direct File</u></a>. They don’t want to just dismantle the IRS. They want to further rewire it, transforming a civic institution into a political instrument. In this vision, taxation is no longer a shared obligation but a mechanism of ideological enforcement. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/opinion/musk-doge-data-ai.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Surveillance becomes the method</u></a>, and loyalty to the president the metric. This transformation is rooted in the logic of <em>new public management</em>—a technocratic framework that reshapes public institutions to resemble private firms: lean, automated, data-driven, and detached from democratic accountability.&nbsp;</p><p>This shift doesn’t just weaken the IRS. It bypasses the democratic infrastructure that’s supposed to govern it. What was once a chain of accountability—from lawmaking to enforcement to public benefit—is now being rerouted through executive command and algorithmic control. Under this model, the IRS ceases to be a steward of fiscal democracy and instead morphs into an engine of information extraction: surveilling the public, enforcing hierarchy, and concentrating power.</p><p>The consequences are already visible: the IRS’s <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/irs-ice-agreement-weakening-privacy-protections-poses-risks-for-all-taxpayers?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>agreement</u></a> to share confidential taxpayer data with ICE has raised alarms about privacy and the agency's role in enforcement beyond taxation; and the threatened revocations of nonprofit status for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-exempt-status.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>universities,</u></a> climate organizations, and racial justice groups—justified under the guise of fiscal scrutiny—are not neutral acts of enforcement. They are <strong>party-focused interventions</strong>, using the tax code to intimidate critics and constrain dissent.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve seen this before, and it should scare us. In countries like Hungary and Rwanda, governments have turned tax authorities into instruments of repression—not by banning civil society outright, but by burying it in audits, compliance demands, and legal ambiguity. Bureaucratic coercion becomes a substitute for overt censorship. The United States is now testing the contours of that same strategy: deploying regulatory pressure to erode opposition, cloaking political retaliation in administrative form, and transforming fiscal policy into a weapon of ideological discipline.</p><p>What’s also being lost in all of this is not just IRS institutional expertise or workforce capacity. It’s the legitimacy of the social contract: the idea that taxation is a collective democratic function. DOGE’s approach echoes a system where data is extracted not to serve the public, but to entrench private and executive power. In this framework, the IRS no longer upholds civic duty, but instead enforces obedience. Public authority <strong>remains</strong>, but democratic accountability <strong>disappears</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"if-you-control-the-tax-code-and-the-irs-you-control-the-state-and-the-people\"><strong>If You Control the Tax Code and the IRS, You Control the State and The People</strong></h3><p>This isn’t just bureaucratic reshuffling. It’s a battle over the very structure of American democracy. The IRS, as the engine of fiscal governance, is being gutted, rewired, and weaponized. While Congress still (in theory) formally holds the power of the purse, control over how tax laws are enforced and against whom is increasingly shifting to the executive branch. And the tax code, once a tool for potential shared investment, is being further entrenched as a shield for elite impunity.</p><p>If a sitting president can direct the IRS to investigate political enemies, revoke nonprofit status from dissenting institutions, or selectively enforce tax law to reward loyalty, the agency no longer serves the public. It serves power. The slow hollowing of the IRS through funding cuts, staff attrition, and the erosion of norms yields the same result: a weakened institution unable to enforce the law, uphold equity, or hold the powerful to account.</p><p>And when that happens, the disparities baked into our fiscal system deepen. The rich, already shielded by armies of tax lawyers and offshore vehicles, become even more invisible to enforcement. Meanwhile, the working class, especially Black and brown taxpayers, are subject to increased scrutiny and bureaucratic punishment. When Nixon overstepped, Congress stepped in. But today, a deeply polarized legislature, decades of executive aggrandizement, and a judiciary increasingly deferential to presidential authority have eroded those checks. Now the stakes are higher, not just because of the power being wielded, but because of whom that power targets and whom it protects.</p><p>We are no longer just watching a system decay. We are watching it be consolidated to serve private power, silence dissent, and reverse the very idea of democratic taxation. It’s a constitutional breakdown. If the IRS falls, we won’t just lose an agency; we’ll lose one of the last institutional expressions of democratic obligation. Taxation is not just how we keep a number of key infrastructures running—it is how we declare what we value, who we protect, and who must answer to the public. The IRS reflects that social contract, however imperfectly, and not without deep bias. But unlike some other federal institutions, its mandate remains tenuously anchored in public law and congressional oversight. It is one of the few places where the struggle over fiscal accountability is still active and, for now, structurally possible.</p><p>We don’t need to defend what the IRS has been. We need to fight for what it could be: a mechanism of equity, not control by the elite. And accountability, not surveillance. But if we allow it to collapse—or worse, to be captured for authoritarianism—we may wake up in a country where taxation still exists, <strong>but democracy does not.</strong></p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-fiscal-state-under-siege-why-people-hate-the-irs-and-why-you-should-care/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"0ee75e51-9339-4b4f-b76d-c03f4b94c0d7","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"684a7989b3542f0001f70a51","reading_time":14}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"June 10","id":"Ghost__Post__6848547bdcf72200012b9711","title":"NOTICE: I’m available for talks and other kinds of paid speaking engagements","slug":"notice-im-available-for-talks-and-other-kinds-of-paid-speaking-engagements","featured":false,"feature_image":null,"featuredImg":null,"excerpt":"email me to inquire\n\nI- Nathan Tankus- have never mentioned it to my email list, but in the fine print of my website I’ve always listed that I’m available for paid speaking engagements.

The basic idea of that piece is simply that “repo rates”- the interest rate at which you can, in essence, borrow funds with treasury securities as collateral- didn’t move outside of the Federal Reserve’s target range. In the language of Wall Street, the Federal Reserve didn’t step in because the “money market” didn’t meltdown. The Federal Reserve, as well as market participants themselves, knew the money market didn’t meltdown. But how did they know a meltdown wasn’t happening?\n\nSimply put: they had the data. Specifically they had the data, known under the name “Secured Overnight Financing Rate Data”, tracking both the volumes and prices in the repo market, published daily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Yet, under the surface, this data is less “New York Fed” than it seems. The FRBNY only collects one segment of the data. The rest comes from the Office of Financial Research, an entity within the United States Treasury created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill. \n\nWhich brings me to the main subject of this piece. On Wednesday, the Financial Times Alphaville blog did a piece entitled “Could Trump’s ‘big beautiful bill’ kill the OFR and accidentally sabotage SOFR?” This possibility was very alarming, so Thursday I put aside the other things I’ve been working on and devoted myself full time to talking to numerous sources about this important issue. There are many extremely important and concerning things going on during this still-ongoing constitutional crisis. However, the combination of the obscurity of this issue, its far-reaching importance, and the rare combination of financial, macroeconomic and legal knowledge needed to report on its various aspects adequately demanded detailed Notes on the Crises coverage.\n\nTo start then, let’s focus on Dodd-Frank. Specifically, the unique method by which the Office of Financial Research is funded. In an attempt to avoid being subject to annual appropriations—a perpetual concern here at Notes on the Crises—Dodd-Frank created a fee (referred to as an “assessment”) on the largest banks (known as “Systemically Important Financial Institutions”) as well as any banks with 250 billion dollars, or more, in assets. Collecting this leads to a positive balance in the “Financial Research Fund”. This “fund”, in turn, authorizes expenditures by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Office of Financial Research. To put things more precisely: the secretary of the Treasury (who is chairman of FSOC) proposes an FSOC budget each year. Then, if ratified by a majority of Financial Stability Oversight Council voting members, that becomes FSOC’s budget. The OFR director meanwhile determines OFR’s budget “in consultation” with the Treasury secretary (in practice they treat that “consultation” as a veto).  Both budget processes lead to expenditures that “debit” the Financial Research Fund. \n\nIn other words, we are back to the topic of accounting gimmicks. The Federal Government has all sorts of accounting gimmicks to distinguish different types of spending, even if payments ultimately flow out of the Bureau of Fiscal Service and the very same bank account. The point of this accounting gimmick is to avoid annual congressional appropriations fights. That means that for accounting purposes, the expenditures “come out” of this fund, rather than the “general fund”. But it's all public money. To be clear, I do not call this an “accounting gimmick” pejoratively. I think insulating financial regulators from annual appropriations is a good thing. It's just that trying to do so through avoiding the politics of government budgeting is self-defeating.\n\nEnter the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA if you have the stomach churning misfortune of having to work on congressional issues right now. As FT Alphaville first reported, the house legislation limits the “assessments” that can be levied. Specifically, it limits the assessments to a three year rolling average of the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s expenses. Excess sums that happen to be “in” the Financial Research Fund get “moved” to the general fund. Sweeping “money” from one “fund” to the general fund is an accounting gimmick, meant to limit the expenditures those “side funds” authorize. Thus, without ever even mentioning the Office of Financial Research, this provision implicitly moves its budget to zero. So much for avoiding annual congressional appropriations fights! Live by the accounting gimmick—die by it too.\n\nFT Alphaville was unsure whether this was an intentional move or not. The Republican Majority on the Senate Banking Committee released a press release Friday confirming that they were intentionally eliminating the “duplicative Office of Financial Research (OFR)”. According to sources I’ve talked to in the Senate, Republican committee members have shown little concern with the elimination of the Office of Financial Research. They also seem aware of the concerns over SOFR, because both their “one pager” and “section by section” documents claim their proposals are preserving financing for SOFR. Yet, this “preservation” is not in their legislative text proposal. Confusingly, the “section by section” document even claims, falsely, that their proposed legislative text “provides the Treasury Department with the necessary authority/funds to continue collecting data on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)”.\n\nThere are many reasons to doubt the Majority Senate Banking’s claims. For one thing, if they plan on replicating the OFR’s activities then the alleged budgetary savings would disappear. No one, not least the Congressional Budget Office, has estimated the cost of replicating OFR activities at “main Treasury”. Even if you took the CBO’s estimates at face value, the supposed reduction of the deficit is equivalent to 0.000001% of 2024 GDP per year. Those estimates also come from assuming that the elimination of the bank fees will lead to higher taxable bank income and thus increase corporate tax revenue (I’m not kidding). This is, to say the least, a highly questionable assumption. But let's pretend to take this seriously for a moment. Even if this were true, to call this generously estimated sum a rounding error would be too generous. This highly questionable budgetary saving is not remotely worth risking the stability of the financial system.\n\nBeyond the impracticability of replicating crucial Office of Financial Research activities while “saving money”, there are also various legal and logistical barriers to duplicating that work altogether. To understand the extreme difficulties involved I spoke to Stacey Schreft, who spent a decade as Deputy Director for Research and Analysis at the Office of Financial Research. Schreft only left OFR March 22nd of this year. This is how she summarized the various problems with transferring the OFR’s data collection efforts:\n\nThe Office of Financial Research is the only organization with the authority to collect its data on repurchase agreements from across market participants. The OFR has automated, fully audited pipelines for high-frequency data ingest, transformation, and validation from 80+ industry reporters. These connections are governed by tailored Memorandums of Understanding and interagency agreements, supported by the OFR’s statutory authorities. Transferring or modifying the authority, necessary agreements, and final rules for the OFR’s data collections would likely seriously delay or disrupt the collections. \n\nBut it gets worse. The OFR’s modern IT systems are separate from and stand in sharp contrast to the Treasury’s systems. My understanding is that Treasury could not just take over the collections tomorrow. It would need to take possession of the OFR’s infrastructure because its existing systems aren’t configured to process the kind of data the OFR collects, especially for things like the repo data intake and validation and quality checks. At a time when there has been much talk about the need to modernize federal IT systems to make the government more efficient, defunding the OFR, with its state-of-the-art systems, and moving its data collections elsewhere, especially to Treasury, seems to make little sense.\n\nFinally, the OFR’s analysts and technologists possess unique expertise in financial market structure, repo markets, counterparty risk, and systemic data modeling. These aren’t general-purpose skill sets easily transferred or replicated elsewhere. While FSOC members have technology and research units (or had research units, as many of those units have been or are slated to be eliminated or drastically reduced), none is resourced or mandated to fulfill the OFR’s statutory duties. The OFR’s data stewardship, validation, and transparency mandates are central to collecting data for FSOC and its members and monitoring systemic risk.\n\nIn other words, I am extremely skeptical that the work of the OFR will be readily replicated elsewhere. And I worry that, if this provision becomes law, crucial data about repo markets, hedge funds, short term funding, and money markets won’t be collected without interruption or made available publicly in an accessible way. [Emphasis Added]\n\nTo summarize, there are various legal, information technology and manpower reasons to think that the claims of the Republican Senate Banking Committee members that another part of the Treasury will take on this work without disruption is not credible. It's also important to emphasize that a key reason the Office of Financial Research is such an effective organization is that it is not a financial regulator. This means that agencies aren’t as averse to sharing their data with it, in a way they would be with other financial regulators. This issue applies to an even greater degree to private actors who took years to become comfortable sharing data with the Office of Financial Research, assured that that data would not be used for supervisory purposes by a regulator. This issue is especially important if the Treasury as a whole doesn’t inherit the OFR’s ability to require data reporting, and has to undertake a volunteer survey.\n\nThe Financial Stability Oversight Council is the Office of Financial Research’s main “client” within the Federal Government. Their data collection and publishing efforts are the main thing which distinguishes FSOC activities from a simple excuse for financial regulators to get together and meet in a fancy room. It's also important to emphasize that since the Treasury secretary is the one who “proposes” the FSOC’s budget, Secretary Bessent could also permanently defund FSOC. In the most extreme scenario, his next three proposed budgets could be 0 dollars—which would mean that even a hypothetical future Democratic administration could not refund the council without new congressional legislation. At the very least, he could propose budgets that reduce the FSOC to a skeleton staff, like Secretary Mnuchin did during the first Trump administration. The difference this time would be that a Democratic Treasury Secretary would be prevented by law from rebuilding the Financial Stability Oversight Council.\n\nNellie Liang, Brookings senior fellow and most recently under secretary for domestic finance at the U.S. Treasury Department in the Biden administration, told me over the weekend that:\n\nGiven the importance of market-based intermediation and that it often draws collectively on banks, securities firms, private funds, and insurers to provide credit to households and businesses, it is critical to have FSOC to improve communication and coordination across the different regulators since no individual regulator will have the visibility or ability to ensure that systemic financial risks are not building [emphasis added]\n\nEven if Treasury Secretary Bessent doesn’t gut the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s budget itself, its work will be greatly weakened if it doesn’t have OFR to support it.\n\nLet's take a step back for a moment. That was an enormous amount of detail, and I’m sure most readers are overwhelmed. The reason this issue is so important is that the Office of Financial Research provides both the federal government and Wall Street with key information about the evolution of the financial system and daily data about the state of the repo market, and short term funding markets in general (it’s worth revisiting the last interview Paul Krugman did with me on these topics). In such erratic times, having less data in a less timely manner on the various markets that have the potential to meltdown when volatility spikes too much could be the difference between a stressed but resilient financial system and a full blown financial crisis.\n\nWhich brings me to a major Office of Financial Research project that has been more than a decade in the making. In the 2008 Global Financial Crisis one factor which was seen to exacerbate the crisis was that financial derivatives were so often agreements between two parties. That meant that not only did companies risk that their bet would “go wrong”: they also risked that their bet would “go right”, but their counterparty couldn’t pay. Thus, a major part of the Dodd-Frank legislation was to try to mandate the use of central clearinghouses for derivative contracts. That way, the only counterparty uncertainty that mattered was with the clearinghouse itself. (For the basics of clearinghouses, check out this “Monetary Policy 101” piece from 2020)\n\nWhat Dodd-Frank didn’t do was mandate central clearing in government securities and repurchase agreement markets. Remember that we said some data was collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York? That data was from the “Bank of New York Mellon” (“BNY”), one of the main government securities clearinghouses. The other data that goes into the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) comes from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, another absolutely crucial clearing bank, and is collected by the Office of Financial Research. Having OFR collect data for this series was an intentional choice to prepare for the entrance of other clearing banks into these businesses, and data collection would need to reach those new clearinghouses to enter SOFR. In any case, a major part of the market had been missed by not collecting data in the dark underworld of repurchase agreements that are not centrally cleared.\n\nSo it was intuitive for the Office of Financial Research to step into the breach. After multiple data collection pilots OFR began the process of making this a permanent dataset, with mandatory reporting by various financial institutions, over the last few years. The final rule requiring institutions to report this data only came into effect July 5th 2024, while the data collection itself only began in December. More entities are required to report starting July 1st, just a few weeks from now. This data, known by the ugly acronym “NCCBR” or “Non-Centrally Cleared Bilateral Repo”, has already provided a great deal of insight. Biden Treasury Under secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang told me, in relation to this topic, that:\n\nTreasury repo markets are the anchor of US funding markets and financial market liquidity, and SOFR provides market-sensitive information each day on the cost and conditions in that market. We should not be dismantling repo data collections at this time, when Treasury market debt is growing rapidly and concerns about market liquidity are increasing.  Instead, we need to continue to improve Treasury repo data, including adding the new data from OFR on uncleared bilateral repo, which has been a key source of fire sale risks in recent years. [emphasis added]\n\nLike other quotes from former government officials I’ve published in Notes on the Crises, this statement may seem subdued. But for an on the record quote from a very senior recent United States Treasury Official, this is quite alarming language. \n\nFormer Deputy Director of the Office of Financial Research Stacey Schreft also had much to say about this, having spent so much time and energy on collecting and understanding this data:\n\nVisibility into the huge NCCBR segment of the repo market matters for two reasons in particular. First, NCCBR activity can affect liquidity in Treasury markets and money markets. The OFR has a pulse on this through its NCCBR data collection. In the global financial crisis of 2008-09, disruptions in the repo market played a pivotal role, spreading stress across the financial system more widely. The NCCBR market segment is also proving to be much larger than expected, accounting for more than 40% of all repos. Should the collection of these data vanish, or be disrupted, forces like those observed in the 2008-09 crisis could build without the public or the government being aware of them. [Emphasis added]\n\nThis is already bad enough, but as we’ve discussed previously, the institutions that are likely to explode are hedge funds. The Office of Financial Research has also collated and harmonized data on hedge funds from across the federal government, providing greater insight into their leverage and vulnerabilities in what it calls its “hedge fund monitor”. Losing OFR thus costs insight and understanding from a key area of our financial system from multiple directions\n\nThe last I heard from congressional sources, defunding the Office of Financial Research was still on track to happen, as long as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act itself passes. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s office gave me this quote from Elizabeth Warren in response to my request for comment:\n\nAt a moment when most American families are worried about a potential recession, President Trump and Congressional Republicans are trying to eliminate the Office of Financial Research and destroy the Financial Stability Oversight Council with their “Big, Beautiful Bill.” These offices were created after the 2008 financial crisis to identify financial sector risks that could set off the next major financial crash, and their destruction at the hands of Republicans would leave millions of American families vulnerable to the next crisis.\n\nI think Elizabeth Warren’s assessment of the situation is both fair and accurate. \n\nDemocrats on the Senate Banking committee are looking to make their case to the senate “Parliamentarian”, the infamous interpreter of Senate rules and procedure. Their case centers around the “Byrd rule” which was aimed to stop so-called “abuse” of the legislative budgetary process to insert “non-budgetary” items that would not get past a filibuster. The senate procedure experts I’ve talked to are skeptical that this will succeed; And, in any case, Senate majority leadership can just… ignore the Parliamentarian. Thus, it will take a surprise outcry from both the public, or Wall Street, to derail killing this obscure little agency that is doing such important work.\n\nWhich brings me to my final point. Last Thursday the Financial Stability Oversight Council released its March 20th 2025 minutes, its first meeting minutes of the second Trump administration. The minutes have many interesting details, but their summation of what Treasury secretary Bessent said about FSOC is especially interesting:\n\nThe Chairperson said in conclusion that history indicates that markets will not always be calm, and this Council would likely face financial stress at some point. He said that this Council can be a critical forum for helping to evaluate the different vulnerabilities facing the financial system, so that whatever shock materializes, members have a better collective understanding of how it may impact the broader financial system. He said that this approach would also help the Council to be ready to address shocks that arise. He noted that markets and institutions are interconnected, and he said that many financial issues implicate the authorities of multiple agencies. He noted that collaboration and coordination are critical and that the Council is important.\n\nDoes Bessent still think the Council is “important”? Does he support or oppose the Funding of the Office of Financial Research? As of this writing, a Treasury spokesperson had not provided a response to my questions. Bessent, other regulators (including Fed Chairman Jay Powell) and Wall Street executives should be asked if they support, oppose or are neutral on the defunding of the Office of Financial Research, the threat to the Financial Stability Oversight Council—and the risks this attack poses for the stability of the Treasury market, as well as the overall financial system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>Early last week I started working on a piece on why the Federal Reserve didn’t step in during the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>Trump Tariff Financial Panic</u></a>.

Sweeping “money” from one “fund” to the general fund <strong>is an accounting gimmick, </strong>meant to limit the expenditures those “side funds” authorize. Thus, without ever <strong>even mentioning the Office of Financial Research</strong>, this provision implicitly moves its budget to zero. So much for avoiding annual congressional appropriations fights! Live by the accounting gimmick—die by it too.</p><p>FT Alphaville was unsure whether this was an intentional move or not. The Republican Majority on the Senate Banking Committee <a href=\"https://archive.ph/9xNab?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>released a press release Friday</u></a> confirming that they were intentionally eliminating the “duplicative Office of Financial Research (OFR)”. According to sources I’ve talked to in the Senate, Republican committee members have shown little concern with the elimination of the Office of Financial Research. They also seem aware of the concerns over SOFR, because both their <a href=\"https://archive.ph/lTt1M?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“one pager”</u></a> and <a href=\"https://archive.ph/5U4jV?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“section by section”</u></a> documents claim their proposals are preserving financing for SOFR. Yet, this “preservation” is not in their <a href=\"https://archive.ph/uWWAz?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>legislative text proposal</u></a>. Confusingly, the “section by section” document even claims, falsely, that their proposed legislative text “provides the Treasury Department with the necessary authority/funds to continue collecting data on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)”.</p><p>There are many reasons to doubt the Majority Senate Banking’s claims. For one thing, if they plan on replicating the OFR’s activities then the alleged budgetary savings would disappear. No one, <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61379?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>not least the Congressional Budget Office</u></a>, has estimated the cost of replicating OFR activities at “main Treasury”. Even if you took the CBO’s estimates at face value, the supposed reduction of the deficit is equivalent to 0.000001% of 2024 GDP per year. Those estimates also come from assuming that the elimination of the bank fees will lead to higher taxable bank income and thus increase corporate tax revenue (<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61379?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>I’m not kidding</u></a>). This is, to say the least, a highly questionable assumption. But let's pretend to take this seriously for a moment. Even if this were true, to call this generously estimated sum a rounding error would be too generous. This highly questionable budgetary saving is<strong> not remotely worth risking</strong> the stability of the financial system.</p><p>Beyond the impracticability of replicating crucial Office of Financial Research activities while “saving money”, there are also various legal and logistical barriers to duplicating that work altogether. To understand the extreme difficulties involved I spoke to Stacey Schreft, who spent a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250301125052/https://www.financialresearch.gov/staff/\"><u>decade as Deputy Director for Research and Analysis</u></a> at the Office of Financial Research. Schreft only left OFR March 22nd of this year. This is how she summarized the various problems with transferring the OFR’s data collection efforts:</p><blockquote>The Office of Financial Research is the only organization with the authority to collect its data on repurchase agreements from across market participants. The OFR has automated, fully audited pipelines for high-frequency data ingest, transformation, and validation from 80+ industry reporters. These connections are governed by <strong>tailored Memorandums of Understanding and interagency agreements, supported by the OFR’s statutory authorities</strong>. Transferring or modifying the authority, necessary agreements, and final rules for the OFR’s data collections would likely seriously delay or disrupt the collections.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>But it gets worse. The OFR’s modern IT systems are separate from and stand in sharp contrast to the Treasury’s systems. My understanding is that Treasury could not just take over the collections tomorrow. It would need to take possession of the OFR’s infrastructure because its existing systems aren’t configured to process the kind of data the OFR collects, especially for things like the repo data intake and validation and quality checks. At a time when there has been much talk about the need to modernize federal IT systems to make the government more efficient, <strong>defunding the OFR, with its state-of-the-art systems</strong>, and moving its data collections elsewhere, especially to Treasury, seems to <strong>make little sense</strong>.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally, the OFR’s analysts and technologists possess unique expertise in financial market structure, repo markets, counterparty risk, and systemic data modeling. These aren’t <strong>general-purpose skill sets easily transferred</strong> or replicated elsewhere. While FSOC members have technology and research units (or <strong>had research units, as many of those units have been or are slated to be eliminated or drastically reduced</strong>), none is resourced or mandated to fulfill the OFR’s statutory duties. The OFR’s data stewardship, validation, and transparency mandates are <strong>central to collecting data for FSOC and its members and monitoring systemic risk.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>In other words, <strong>I am extremely skeptical that the work of the OFR will be readily replicated elsewhere</strong>. And I worry that, if this provision becomes law, <strong>crucial data</strong> about repo markets, hedge funds, short term funding, and money markets won’t be collected <strong>without interruption or made available publicly in an accessible way. </strong>[Emphasis Added]</blockquote><p>To summarize, there are various legal, information technology and manpower reasons to think that the claims of the Republican Senate Banking Committee members that another part of the Treasury will take on this work without disruption <strong>is not credible. </strong>It's also important to emphasize that a key reason the Office of Financial Research is such an effective organization is that it is <strong>not a financial regulator</strong>. This means that agencies aren’t as averse to sharing their data with it, in a way they would be with other financial regulators. This issue applies to an even greater degree to private actors who took years to become comfortable sharing data with the Office of Financial Research, assured that that data would not be used for supervisory purposes by a regulator. This issue is especially important if the Treasury as a whole doesn’t inherit the OFR’s ability to require data reporting, and has to undertake a volunteer survey.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf4Tmuj0aBtghIAMUM1xyz40mXTyxye5z6RcGFp20KJ3MaU-u8W8w3YioKBbXw5hDCU-_biN3J72nC9xtIuOaQB09LHMpOgbRiG1gUqf1fzRFYmRyjpLCbE5jG-YQj8Da5H62-TLg?key=c_FXjI4NpHlmePcrajzslg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"316\"></figure><p>The Financial Stability Oversight Council is the Office of Financial Research’s main “client” within the Federal Government. Their data collection and publishing efforts are the main thing which distinguishes FSOC activities from a simple excuse for financial regulators to get together and <a href=\"https://usdotyorktel.rev.vbrick.com/?ref=crisesnotes.com#/videos/90e0b702-d70c-4966-a4ae-5eb3b37cc9a2\"><u>meet in a fancy room</u></a>. It's also important to emphasize that since the Treasury secretary is the one who “proposes” the FSOC’s budget, Secretary Bessent could also permanently defund FSOC. In the most extreme scenario, his next three proposed budgets could be 0 dollars—which would mean that even a hypothetical future Democratic administration could not refund the council without new congressional legislation. At the very least, he could propose budgets that reduce the FSOC to a skeleton staff, like Secretary Mnuchin did during the first Trump administration. The difference this time would be that a Democratic Treasury Secretary would be prevented by law from rebuilding the Financial Stability Oversight Council.</p><p>Nellie Liang, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/people/nellie-liang/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Brookings senior fellow</u></a> and most recently under secretary for domestic finance at the U.S. Treasury Department in the Biden administration, told me over the weekend that:</p><blockquote>Given the importance of market-based intermediation and that it often draws collectively on banks, securities firms, private funds, and insurers to provide credit to households and businesses, it is <strong>critical to have FSOC to improve communication and coordination</strong> across the different regulators <strong>since no individual regulator will have the visibility or ability to ensure that systemic financial risks are not building </strong>[emphasis added]</blockquote><p>Even if Treasury Secretary Bessent doesn’t gut the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s budget itself, its work will be greatly weakened if it doesn’t have OFR to support it.</p><p>Let's take a step back for a moment. That was an enormous amount of detail, and I’m sure most readers are overwhelmed. The reason this issue is so important is that the Office of Financial Research <strong>provides both the federal government and Wall Street with key information</strong> about the evolution of the financial system and daily data about the state of the repo market, and short term funding markets in general (it’s worth revisiting <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/liquidity-volatility-and-market-craziness-paul-krugman-interviews-nathan-tankus-again/\"><u>the last interview Paul Krugman did with me on these topics</u></a>). In such erratic times, having less data in a less timely manner on the various markets that have the potential to meltdown when volatility spikes too much could be the difference between a stressed but resilient financial system and <strong>a full blown financial crisis</strong>.</p><p>Which brings me to a major Office of Financial Research project that has been more than a decade in the making. In the 2008 Global Financial Crisis one factor which was seen to exacerbate the crisis was that <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>financial derivatives were so often agreements</u></a> between two parties. That meant that not only did companies risk that their bet would “go wrong”: they also risked that their bet would “go right”, but their counterparty couldn’t pay. Thus, a major part of the Dodd-Frank legislation was to try to mandate the use of central clearinghouses for derivative contracts. That way, the only counterparty uncertainty that mattered was with the clearinghouse itself. (For the basics of clearinghouses, check out this <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/payment-systems-monetary-policy-101/\"><u>“Monetary Policy 101” piece from 2020</u></a>)</p><p>What Dodd-Frank<a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/financial-stability-publications/macroprudential-bulletin/focus/2025/html/ecb.mpbu202501_focus01.en.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> didn’t do was mandate central clearing in government securities and repurchase </u></a>agreement markets. Remember that we said some data was collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York? That data was from the “Bank of New York Mellon” (“BNY”), one of the main government securities clearinghouses. The other data that goes into the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) comes from the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation, another absolutely crucial clearing bank, and is collected by the Office of Financial Research. Having OFR collect data for this series was an intentional choice to prepare for the <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC_20250320_Minutes.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>entrance of other clearing banks</u></a> into these businesses, and data collection would need to reach those new clearinghouses to enter SOFR. In any case, a major part of the market had been missed by not collecting data in the dark underworld of repurchase agreements that are not centrally cleared.</p><p>So it was intuitive for the Office of Financial Research to step into the breach. After multiple data collection pilots OFR began the process of making this a permanent dataset, with mandatory reporting by various financial institutions, over the last few years. The final rule requiring institutions to report this data <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/06/2024-08999/ongoing-data-collection-of-non-centrally-cleared-bilateral-transactions-in-the-us-repurchase?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>only came into effect July 5th 2024</u></a>, while the data collection itself only began in December. More entities are required to report starting July 1st, just a few weeks from now. This data, known by the <a href=\"https://www.financialresearch.gov/data/collections/non-centrally-cleared-bilateral-repo-data/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>ugly acronym “NCCBR” or “Non-Centrally Cleared Bilateral Repo”</u></a>, has already provided <strong>a great deal of insight. </strong>Biden Treasury Under secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang told me, in relation to this topic, that:</p><blockquote>Treasury repo markets <strong>are the anchor of US funding markets and financial market liquidity</strong>, and SOFR provides market-sensitive information each day on the cost and conditions in that market. We should not be dismantling repo data collections at this time, when Treasury market debt is growing rapidly and concerns about market liquidity are increasing.&nbsp; Instead, we need to continue to improve Treasury repo data,<strong> including adding the new data from OFR on uncleared bilateral repo, which has been a key source of fire sale risks in recent years. </strong>[emphasis added]</blockquote><p>Like other quotes from former government officials I’ve published in <em>Notes on the Crises</em>, this statement may seem subdued. But for an on the record quote from a very senior recent United States Treasury Official,<strong> this is quite alarming language.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Former Deputy Director of the Office of Financial Research Stacey Schreft also had much to say about this, having spent so much time and energy on collecting and understanding this data:</p><blockquote>Visibility into the <strong>huge NCCBR segment of the repo market</strong> matters for two reasons in particular. First, NCCBR activity can affect liquidity in Treasury markets and money markets. The OFR has a pulse on this through its NCCBR data collection. In the global financial crisis of 2008-09, <strong>disruptions in the repo market played a pivotal role, spreading stress across the financial system</strong> more widely. The NCCBR market segment is also <strong>proving to be much larger than expected, accounting for more than 40% of all repos</strong>. Should the collection of these data vanish, or be disrupted, forces like those <strong>observed in the 2008-09 crisis could build without the public or the government being aware of them</strong>. [Emphasis added]</blockquote><p>This is already bad enough, but <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/liquidity-volatility-and-market-craziness-paul-krugman-interviews-nathan-tankus-again/\"><u>as we’ve discussed previously</u></a>, <strong>the institutions that are likely to explode are hedge funds.</strong> The Office of Financial Research <strong>has also</strong> collated and harmonized data on hedge funds from across the federal government, providing greater insight into their leverage and vulnerabilities in what it <a href=\"https://www.financialresearch.gov/hedge-fund-monitor/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>calls its “hedge fund monitor”</u></a>. Losing OFR thus costs insight and understanding from a key area of our financial system from multiple directions</p><p>The last I heard from congressional sources, defunding the Office of Financial Research was still on track to happen, as long as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act itself passes. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s office gave me this quote from Elizabeth Warren in response to my request for comment:</p><blockquote>At a moment when most American families are worried about a potential recession, President Trump and Congressional Republicans are trying to eliminate the Office of Financial Research and destroy the Financial Stability Oversight Council with their “Big, Beautiful Bill.” These offices were created after the 2008 financial crisis to identify financial sector risks that could set off the next major financial crash, and their destruction at the hands of Republicans would leave millions of American families vulnerable to the next crisis.</blockquote><p>I think Elizabeth Warren’s assessment of the situation is both fair and accurate.&nbsp;</p><p>Democrats on the Senate Banking committee are looking to make their case to the senate “Parliamentarian”, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentarian_of_the_United_States_Senate?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>infamous interpreter of Senate rules and procedure</u></a>. Their case centers around the “Byrd rule” which was aimed to stop so-called “abuse” of the legislative budgetary process to insert “non-budgetary” items that would not get past a filibuster. The senate procedure experts I’ve talked to are skeptical that this will succeed; And, in any case, Senate majority leadership can just… ignore the Parliamentarian. Thus, it will take a surprise outcry from both the public, or Wall Street, to derail killing this obscure little agency that is doing such important work.</p><p>Which brings me to my final point. Last Thursday the Financial Stability Oversight Council released <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC_20250320_Minutes.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>its March 20th 2025 minutes</u></a>, its first meeting minutes of the second Trump administration. The minutes have many interesting details, but their summation of what Treasury secretary Bessent said about <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC_20250320_Minutes.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>FSOC is especially interesting</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The Chairperson said in conclusion that history indicates that markets will not always be calm, and this Council would likely face financial stress at some point. He said that this Council can be a critical forum for helping to evaluate the different vulnerabilities facing the financial system, so that whatever shock materializes, <strong>members have a better collective understanding</strong> of how it may impact the broader financial system. He said that this approach would also help the Council to be ready to address shocks that arise. He noted that markets and institutions are interconnected, and he said that many financial issues implicate the authorities of multiple agencies. He noted that <strong>collaboration and coordination are critical and that the Council is important.</strong></blockquote><p>Does Bessent still think the Council is “important”? Does he support or oppose the Funding of the Office of Financial Research? As of this writing, a Treasury spokesperson had not provided a response to my questions. Bessent, other regulators (including Fed Chairman Jay Powell) and Wall Street executives should be asked if they support, oppose or are neutral on the defunding of the Office of Financial Research, the threat to the Financial Stability Oversight Council—and the risks this attack poses for the stability of the Treasury market, as well as the overall financial system.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-eliminates-the-office-of-financial-research/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"1c5550fa-b274-46d8-adf7-57ad5afd186f","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"68478f19496bc10001f18b9c","reading_time":13}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"June 5","id":"Ghost__Post__6841b48914b8dd0001d83f67","title":"Incantations of National Emergency: The U.S. Court of International Trade Provides Crucial Historical Context","slug":"incantations-of-national-emergency-the-u-s-court-of-international-trade-provides-crucial-historical-context","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/06/Court-of-International-Trade-Background.png","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b80808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/b371a93a6d87156bc4b0a82754a1a6a6/dd075/Court-of-International-Trade-Background.png","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/b371a93a6d87156bc4b0a82754a1a6a6/715a6/Court-of-International-Trade-Background.png 398w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b371a93a6d87156bc4b0a82754a1a6a6/fc129/Court-of-International-Trade-Background.png 796w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b371a93a6d87156bc4b0a82754a1a6a6/dd075/Court-of-International-Trade-Background.png 1592w","sizes":"(min-width: 1592px) 1592px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/b371a93a6d87156bc4b0a82754a1a6a6/530b5/Court-of-International-Trade-Background.webp 398w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b371a93a6d87156bc4b0a82754a1a6a6/a621f/Court-of-International-Trade-Background.webp 796w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b371a93a6d87156bc4b0a82754a1a6a6/09728/Court-of-International-Trade-Background.webp 1592w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1592px) 1592px, 100vw"}]},"width":1592,"height":830}}},"excerpt":"This is a free piece of Notes on the Crises.

Here's my address: bc1qegxarzsfga9ycesfa7wm77sqmuqqv7083c6ss6\n\nWednesday last week the U.S. Court of International Trade took the country by surprise with a sudden decision knocking down Trump’s tariffs. Many readers have likely never heard of this institution, which is understandable. Its usual case load is obscure, well, trade issues. Before we get into the specifics of the court decision in a future piece, I want to provide extended background on the court’s history and the concurrent legislative history of executive discretion over tariffs. “Executive discretion over tariffs” is just a fancy way of talking about the president being able to change tariff rates without new legislation by congress. I’m especially interested in this since the problems at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service and the Automated Clearing House system have made me more interested in how the Federal Judiciary might, or might not, respond to what we can call “payments system-based attacks” on the Judicial system.\n\nAnyway,  some form of federal trade court has existed since 1890. That year an act of congress created the “Board of General Appraisers”, an administrative court housed in the Treasury. What that means is that legal disputes were handled by a part of the executive branch rather than a part of the judicial branch and you didn’t have the right to go to a conventional court if you lost your case. In 1926 the Board of General Appraisers was renamed the “U.S. Customs court”, but it remained substantively the same (outside of being moved out of the Treasury and into the department of Justice in 1930). \n\nSubscribe\n\nThe U.S. Customs Court only took a familiar shape (well familiar to the nerds interested in this stuff) in 1948 when it was moved out of the executive branch. At the time, its decisions could be appealed to a specialty appeals court straightforwardly named the “Court of Customs and Patent Appeals”. In 1956 it was officially made a fully fledged part of the Federal Judiciary, which involves lifetime appointments and protection against salary reductions. Finally, the Customs Court was renamed to the U.S. Court of International Trade, in legislation which elevated its position and expanded its jurisdiction. Notably, the chief judge of this court is a member of the “Judicial Conference of the United States”. This obscure body governs the Federal Judiciary itself and will become increasingly important as the attacks by the Trump administration on the Federal Judiciary escalate- especially at the payments level.\n\nWhat led to this increasing shift from 1890 to today? Simply put, international trade issues became more important and more complex. Consistent and clear decisions were seen as key to ongoing trade relations with other countries, and the judicial review of international trade disputes was reshaped- and strengthened- to accommodate this. In some sense then, the legal design of international trade from statutes to the organization of the judiciary itself was created in diametric opposition to the freewheeling erratic nature of the Trump administration’s decisions. So it's no surprise that they have come into fundamental conflict. \n\nTo recap then, the U.S. has had a specialized “court” for trade issues for the past 135 years, and that court has been part of the Judicial branch for nearly 70 years. While obscure, this court has been important for quite some time. The extent to which its decisions have not made waves is essentially determined by the lack of dramatic actions by presidents over trade during the past 45 years. Which brings me to the executive branches’ “tariff powers”. \n\nSubscribe\n\nBefore we do so, let's take a moment to step back and examine the big picture. Since January 31st, I’ve been intensely focused on impoundment- the constitutional term for cutting government spending without congressional direction. Given the way modern budgetary legislation is written, this is generally unconstitutional. The idea of unconstitutionally raising taxes is usually so unthinkable that in discussions where that is theoretically a possibility, it is generally set aside. I did that myself in my January 31st piece. Yet, as numerous commentators and Democratic politicians have reminded us, Tariffs are a tax. So when Trump- or any president- changes Tariff rates they are engaging in discretionary control over taxes. What this court case is about is the extent to which Trump has unconstitutionally exceeded his congressionally granted discretion over taxation- specifically tariffs. \n\nLogically enough then, the court case starts with a ten page summary of the evolution of the presidential tariff authority. This section is clear and extremely useful- so useful in fact I would recommend assigning it in undergraduate classes. Before getting to the legislative and judicial history of these powers, the overview from the court does a good job of establishing the central constitutional issues at stake. One branch of government can’t wholesale transfer its powers to another. \n\nThis is known as the “nondelegation” doctrine and to hammer the point home, the court quotes James Madison in the Federalist papers. Thus there needs to be an “intelligible principle” guiding delegation. As the decision itself says:\n\nThus, courts have consistently upheld statutory delegations as long as Congress “lay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise that authority] is directed to conform.” Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989) (quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928))\n\nThis is, predictably, what the rest of the court’s analysis centers on.\n\nWhich brings us the legislative and judicial history of the executive branch’s tariff powers. It shouldn’t be surprising that executive discretion over tariffs really began during World War one. At the time Congress passed the “Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917”. In one sense, these powers were very sweeping. In another sense,  the powers associated with TWEA were limited because it could only be used during “wars”. Meanwhile, the legal definition of a “war” was not as… flexible as it is today. The Pandora's box that led to our current moment was opened during the Great Depression. The Emergency Banking Relief Act of 1933 amended the TWEA to add “or during any other period of national emergency declared by the President”.  This is key because this amendment explicitly connected discretion over tariffs to “national emergencies”- a point we will return to. This power remains essentially unchanged for decades afterwards.\n\nWhat breaks this continuous pattern of extremely expansive presidential tariff powers was the collapse of Bretton Woods- the international system for regulating exchange rates which governed the international economic system after World War Two. This, among other things, ushered in a wave of legislation to respond to the then-unfamiliar phenomena of exchange rate volatility and balance of payments uncertainties. The 1975 Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States I wrote about a few weeks ago was one such product of that legislative wave. The other factor outside of Bretton Woods was, of course, Nixon himself. For one thing, Nixon’s shock end of convertibility of the dollar into gold (for foreign countries) was accompanied by wage & price controls and a 10% tariff on imports. Long time readers will remember my deep interest in this period a few years back and, in particular, the interview I did with Daniel Mitchell, chief economist for the “Pay Board” the body responsible for Nixon’s wage controls.\n\nNixon’s role was not just his actions ending the “gold standard”- his other role was his various executive overreaches and illegal behavior . The mood in the 1970s, in the aftermath of Watergate, was towards restricting executive power. This played out in the arena of impoundment, culminating in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as I wrote about all the way back in “Day 0” of the Trump Musk Payments Crisis. This mood played out in the arena of Tariffs as well. Congress took two key actions in 1977. The first was returning the Trading With the Enemy Act to its original role- war. They simply struck out the amended language that was added during the Great Depression.\n\nIf things had played out somewhat differently, we could end the story here. Instead, while congress was skeptical of the executive branch at that time, the 1970s economic situation convinced them there were peace-time “economic emergencies” that required some kind of executive discretion. Enter the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (“IEEPA”). This act used a lot of the same language that the Trading With the Enemy Act used, but includes a lot more procedural limitations. One crucial limitation is over the meaning of “national emergency” itself.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAs part of this legislative wave restricting executive power was the “National Emergencies Act of 1976”. This put a number of statutory restrictions on presidential declarations of “national emergencies” and subjected these declarations to both greater fact finding, including by the judicial branch, and oversight by both congress and the courts. One of the key restrictions is that the “emergency” actions must actually be aimed at combating the emergency. A direct causal link between an action and a goal is indeed a tough bar for the Trump administration to clear. It also requires the president to report to congress about the national emergency every six months. The original legislation had a number of other constraints which courts have eroded over time- a topic for next week. \n\nThus, to understand Trump’s Tariff moves since the beginning of his presidency… 19 weeks ago (my god does it feel so much longer!) we need to examine his administration’s bizarre approach to the national emergency hurdles these statutes built. In the meantime, the words of a 1975 decision by the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals known as United States v. Yoshida provide an excellent- and prescient- preview:\n\nThe mere incantation of \"national emergency\" cannot, of course, sound the death-knell of the Constitution. Nor can it repeal prior statutes or enlarge the delegation in § 5(b). The declaration of a national emergency is not a talisman enabling the President to rewrite the tariff schedules, as it was not in this case.

Many readers have likely never heard of this institution, which is understandable. Its usual case load is obscure, well, trade issues. Before we get into the specifics of the court decision in a future piece, I want to provide extended background on the court’s history and the concurrent legislative history of executive discretion over tariffs. “Executive discretion over tariffs” is just a fancy way of talking about the president being able to change tariff rates without new legislation by congress. I’m especially interested in this since the problems at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service and the Automated Clearing House system have made me more interested in how the Federal Judiciary might, or might not, respond to what we can call “payments system-based attacks” on the Judicial system.</p><p>Anyway,&nbsp; some form of federal trade court has existed since 1890. That year <a href=\"https://www.cit.uscourts.gov/sites/cit/files/Origins_and_Creation_of_the_Board_of_General_Appraisers.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>an act of congress created</u></a> the “Board of General Appraisers”, an administrative court housed in the Treasury. What that means is that legal disputes <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/new-york-citys-trump-administration-lawsuit-was-fundamentally-amended-based-on-notes-on-the-crises-memo-no-1/\"><u>were handled by a part of the executive branch</u></a> rather than a part of the judicial branch and you didn’t have the right to go to a conventional court if you lost your case. In 1926 the Board of General Appraisers was renamed the “U.S. Customs court”, but it remained substantively the same (outside of being moved out of the Treasury and into the department of Justice in 1930).&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>The U.S. Customs Court only took a familiar shape (well familiar to the nerds interested in this stuff) in <a href=\"https://govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com/legislink/pdf/stat/62/STATUTE-62-Pg869.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>1948 when it was</u></a> moved out of the executive branch. At the time, its decisions could be appealed to a specialty appeals court <a href=\"https://govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com/legislink/pdf/stat/62/STATUTE-62-Pg869.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>straightforwardly named the “Court of Customs and Patent Appeals”</u></a>. In 1956 <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-70/pdf/STATUTE-70-Pg532.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>it was officially made a fully fledged part of the Federal Judiciary</u></a>, which involves lifetime appointments and protection against salary reductions. Finally, the Customs Court was renamed to the U.S. Court of International Trade, in legislation which <a href=\"https://www.cit.uscourts.gov/sites/cit/files/Origins_and_Creation_of_the_Board_of_General_Appraisers.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>elevated its position and expanded its jurisdiction</u></a>. Notably, the chief judge of this court is a member of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Conference_of_the_United_States?ref=crisesnotes.com#Lists_of_members\"><u>“Judicial Conference of the United States”</u></a>. This obscure body governs the Federal Judiciary itself and will become increasingly important as the attacks by the Trump administration on the Federal Judiciary escalate- especially at the payments level.</p><p>What led to this increasing shift from 1890 to today? Simply put, international trade issues became more important and more complex. Consistent and clear decisions were seen as key to ongoing trade relations with other countries, and the judicial review of international trade disputes was <a href=\"https://www.cit.uscourts.gov/sites/cit/files/Origins_and_Creation_of_the_Board_of_General_Appraisers.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>reshaped- and strengthened- to accommodate this</u></a>. In some sense then, the legal design of international trade from statutes to the organization of the judiciary itself was created in diametric opposition to the freewheeling erratic nature of the Trump administration’s decisions. So it's no surprise that they have come into fundamental conflict.&nbsp;</p><p>To recap then, the U.S. has had a specialized “court” for trade issues for the past 135 years, and that court has been part of the Judicial branch for nearly 70 years. While obscure, this court has been important for quite some time. The extent to which its decisions have not made waves is essentially determined by the lack of dramatic actions by presidents over trade during the past 45 years. Which brings me to the executive branches’ “tariff powers”.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Before we do so, let's take a moment to step back and examine the big picture.<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u> Since January 31st, I’ve been intensely focused on impoundment</u></a>- the constitutional term for cutting government spending without congressional direction. Given the way modern budgetary legislation is written, this is generally unconstitutional. The idea of unconstitutionally raising taxes is usually so unthinkable that in discussions where that is theoretically a possibility, it is generally set aside. I did that myself <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>in my January 31st piece</u></a>. Yet, as numerous commentators and Democratic politicians have reminded us, Tariffs are a tax. So when Trump- or any president- changes Tariff rates they are engaging in discretionary control over taxes. What this court case is about is the extent to which Trump has unconstitutionally exceeded his congressionally granted discretion over taxation- specifically tariffs.&nbsp;</p><p>Logically enough then, the court case starts <a href=\"https://www.cit.uscourts.gov/sites/cit/files/25-66.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>with a ten page summary of the evolution of the presidential tariff authority</u></a>. This section is clear and extremely useful- so useful in fact I would recommend assigning it in undergraduate classes. Before getting to the legislative and judicial history of these powers, the overview from the court does a good job of establishing the central constitutional issues at stake. One branch of government can’t wholesale transfer its powers to another.&nbsp;</p><p>This is known as the “nondelegation” doctrine and to hammer the point home, the court quotes James Madison in the Federalist papers. Thus there needs to be an “intelligible principle” guiding delegation. As the <a href=\"https://www.cit.uscourts.gov/sites/cit/files/25-66.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>decision itself says</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Thus, courts have consistently upheld statutory delegations as long as Congress “lay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise that authority] is directed to conform.” Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989) (quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr., &amp; Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928))</blockquote><p>This is, predictably, what the rest of the court’s analysis centers on.</p><p>Which brings us the legislative and judicial history of the executive branch’s tariff powers. It shouldn’t be surprising that executive discretion over tariffs really began during World War one. At the time Congress passed the “Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917”. In one sense, these powers were very sweeping. In another sense,&nbsp; the powers associated with TWEA were limited because it could only be used during “wars”. Meanwhile, the legal definition of a “war” was not as… <a href=\"https://www.pogo.org/analysis/recommendations-for-reclaiming-congress-war-powers?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>flexible as it is today</u></a>. The Pandora's box that led to our current moment was opened during the Great Depression. <a href=\"https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/emergency-banking-relief-act-1098?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>The Emergency Banking Relief Act of 1933 amended the TWEA</u></a> to add “or during any other period of national emergency declared by the President”.&nbsp; This is key because this amendment explicitly connected discretion over tariffs to “national emergencies”- a point we will return to. This power remains essentially unchanged for decades afterwards.</p><p>What breaks this continuous pattern of extremely expansive presidential tariff powers was the collapse of Bretton Woods- the international system for regulating exchange rates which governed the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/premium-transcript-notes-on-the-crises-podcast-4-daniel-mitchell-chief-economist-of-nixons-pay-board/\"><u>international economic system after World War Two</u></a>. This, among other things, ushered in a wave of legislation to respond to the then-unfamiliar phenomena of exchange rate volatility and balance of payments uncertainties. The 1975 <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/cfius50anniversary/\"><u>Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States</u></a> I wrote about a few weeks ago was one such product of that legislative wave. The other factor outside of Bretton Woods was, of course, Nixon himself. For one thing, Nixon’s shock end of convertibility of the dollar into gold (for foreign countries) was accompanied by wage &amp; price controls and a 10% tariff on imports. Long time readers will remember my deep interest in this period a few years back and, in particular, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/premium-transcript-notes-on-the-crises-podcast-4-daniel-mitchell-chief-economist-of-nixons-pay-board/\"><u>the interview I did with Daniel Mitchell, chief economist for the “Pay Board”</u></a> the body responsible for Nixon’s wage controls.</p><p>Nixon’s role was not just his actions ending the “gold standard”- his other role was his various executive overreaches and illegal behavior . The mood in the 1970s, in the aftermath of Watergate, was towards restricting executive power. This played out in the arena of impoundment, culminating in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as I wrote about all the way back in <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>“Day 0” of the Trump Musk Payments Crisis</u></a>. This mood played out in the arena of Tariffs as well. Congress took two key actions in 1977. The first was returning the Trading With the Enemy Act to its original role- war. They simply struck out the amended language that was added during the Great Depression.</p><p>If things had played out somewhat differently, we could end the story here. Instead, while congress was skeptical of the executive branch at that time, the 1970s economic situation convinced them there were peace-time “economic emergencies” that required some kind of executive discretion. Enter the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (“IEEPA”). This act used a lot of the same language that the Trading With the Enemy Act used, but includes a lot more procedural limitations. One crucial limitation is over the meaning of “national emergency” itself.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>As part of this legislative wave restricting executive power was the <a href=\"https://www.cit.uscourts.gov/sites/cit/files/25-66.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“National Emergencies Act of 1976”</u></a>.

Others are covering the details of the Tariffs themselves quite well. The best coverage of the tariff details comes (unsurprisingly) from Joey Politano. I especially recommend checking out this piece as well as last week’s piece on the car tariffs. As usual then, I want to cover the underdiscussed aspects of this drama. This starts where I left off, writing about how the tariffs were putting the financial system under intense stress. Volatility, as measured by the “VIX” index peaked April 8th, and has been declining ever since. My last commentary on this topic was in my interview with Paul Krugman published last month. In it, I focused in on the desperate desire of financial traders to “see past” Trump’s erratic and destructive behavior:\n\n[…] [That] kind of person is the kind of person who's going to look for any off ramp, any sort of little sign that things are going to be better. And so when the stock market went up a whole bunch after Trump's announcement and volatility pared back some, it's not so much that these are more protectionist tariffs, at least as of last Wednesday—Of course, it's changed even more in the week since then. It's not like they were great, but it was just a headline in the news that would make people say, “My God, Trump is backing off. Okay, good.”\n\nAnd what matters is not so much the reality of this thinking, but how different factors interact with each other. And the media apparatuses present a general mood that comes from a certain perspective. It's not so much that Trump needs to actually back off on tariffs or needs to be doing sane tariff policy, it just needs to be perceived as not crazy by these specific kind of idiosyncratic groups of people. [emphasis added]\n\nAs time has passed, Trump has erratically backed off some of his most extreme proposals, or at least the speed at which he was implementing them. He agreed to a 90 day “pause” for the China Tariffs. Yet, his decisions are still erratic. Despite this, volatility — as measured by the Chicago Board Option Exchange’s Volatility Index (VIX) has just declined and declined. Why?\n\nIn a way, I explained it in my piece written at the peak of the instability. In my view, it remains to be seen whether my real-time prediction that that volatility peak was a “Lehman Brothers moment”, as I claimed. It certainly is a qualitatively different issue than Lehman Brothers failure in the details insofar as things still hang on what Trump says. If I was wrong in my boldest claim, it was for a reason I described in the piece itself:\n\nIn essence, this kind of extreme instability is definitionally a crisis because it must be resolved so that the basic stability, even if it's a “false” stability produced by highly motivated conventions, can be established or reestablished. [emphasis added]\n\nThe highly motivated convention that has taken shape over the past month started solidifying with the Financial Times’ Robert Armstrong who coined TACO: Trump Always Chickens Out on May 2nd. This phrase has everything. It insults Trump, it's catchy and memorable, and it boils down a set of complex issues to its essentials. Wall Street has run with it. Hence why, despite everything that has happened, the S&P 500 is basically flat on the year.\n\nOf course, this reached a crescendo last Wednesday when a reporter asked Trump himself about “TACO”. I think it's worth quoting the back and forth verbatim and in full. We have gotten so used to Trump that we have generally tuned out the way he goes on and on. But there’s a lot of insight to be gleaned from his mental state by listening to or reading his attempt to explain his policy views at length. I also think there are important differences between how he articulates himself now, versus his first term:\n\nReporter: Mr. President, Wall Street analysts have coined a new term called the TACO trade. They're saying Trump Always Chickens Out on the tariff threats and that's why markets are higher this week. What's your response to that? \n\nTrump: I kick out? \n\nReporter: Chicken out. \n\nTrump: Oh, isn't that nice. chicken out? I've never heard that. You mean because I reduced China from 145% that I set down to 100 and then down to another number and I said you have to open up your whole country and because - uh - I - I gave the European Union a 50% tax uh tariff and they called up and they said “please let's meet right now. Please let's meet right now.” And I said okay I'll give you till July. I actually asked them I said what's the date? because they weren't willing to meet. And after I did what I did, they said, \"We'll meet anytime you want.\" And we have an end date of July 9th. You call that chickening out because we have 14 trillion dollars now invested, committed to investing; When Biden didn't have practically anything, Biden, this country was dying. \n\nYou know, we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. I went to Saudi Arabia. The king told me, he said, \"You got the hottest c.”- We have the hottest country in the world right now. Six months ago, this country was stone cold dead. We had a dead country. We had a country people didn't think it was going to survive.\" And you ask a nasty question like that. Uh it's called negotiation. You set a number and if you go down, you know, if I set a number at a ridiculous high number and I go down a little bit, you know, a little bit, they want me to hold that number. 145% tariff. Even I said, \"Man, that really got up.\" You know how it got? Because of fentanyl and many other things. And you added it up. I said, \"Where are we now? We're at 145%.\" I said, \"Woo, that's high. That's high.\" They were doing no business whatsoever. \n\nAnd they were having a lot of problems. We were very nice to China. I don't know if they're going to be nice to us, but we were very nice to China. And in many ways, I think we really helped China tremendously because, you know, they were having great difficulty because we were basically going cold turkey with China. We were doing no business because of the tariff, because it was so high. But I knew that. But don't ever say what you said. That's a nasty question. Go ahead. To me, that's the nastiest question.  [emphasis added]\n\nDespite this reporter tempting fate, so far “TACO” is holding. Yet, we also haven’t seen empty shelves that seem to be coming. Will Wall Street’s response shift when Trump’s erratic behavior comes with a more visceral impact? And, knowing Trump, his response to shocking economic pain will likely be even more dramatic, erratic behavior. \n\nThat’s all without discussing the surprise decision from the Court of International Trade. But that will have to wait for next time.","html":"<p>It has been some time since I’ve provided detailed analysis of the Trump Tariff situation.

In my view, it remains to be seen whether my real-time prediction that that volatility peak was a “Lehman Brothers moment”, as I claimed. It certainly is a qualitatively different issue than Lehman Brothers failure in the details insofar as things still hang on what Trump says. If I was wrong in my boldest claim, it was for a reason I <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>described in the piece itself</u></a>:</p><blockquote>In essence, this kind of extreme instability is definitionally a crisis because it must be resolved so that the basic stability,<strong> even if it's a “false” stability produced by highly motivated convention</strong>s, can be established or reestablished. [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>The highly motivated convention that has taken shape over the past month started solidifying with the Financial Times’ Robert Armstrong who coined <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e81ae481-fbb6-47e7-bd6b-c7d76ca5ab69?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>TACO: Trump Always Chickens Out on May 2nd</u></a>. This phrase has everything. It insults Trump, it's catchy and memorable, and it boils down a set of complex issues to its essentials. Wall Street has run with it. Hence why, despite everything that has happened, the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ES=F/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>S&amp;P 500 is basically flat on the year</u></a>.</p><p>Of course, this reached a crescendo last Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsZEnvWB9m8&t=13s&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>when a reporter asked Trump himself about “TACO”</u></a>. I think it's worth quoting the back and forth verbatim and in full. We have gotten so used to Trump that we have generally tuned out the way he goes on and on. But there’s a lot of insight to be gleaned from his mental state by listening to or reading his attempt to explain his policy views at length. I also think there are important differences between how he articulates himself now, versus his first term:</p><blockquote><strong>Reporter:</strong> Mr. President, Wall Street analysts have coined a new term called the TACO trade. They're saying Trump Always Chickens Out on the tariff threats and that's why markets are higher this week. What's your response to that?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Trump:</strong> I kick out?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Reporter:</strong> Chicken out.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Trump: </strong>Oh, isn't that nice. chicken out? I've never heard that. You mean because I reduced <strong>China from 145% that I set down to 100 and then down to another number</strong> and I said you have to open up your whole country and because - uh - I - I gave the European Union a 50% tax uh tariff and they called up and they said “please let's meet right now. Please let's meet right now.” And I said okay I'll give you till July. I actually asked them I said what's the date? because they weren't willing to meet. And after I did what I did, they said, \"We'll meet anytime you want.\" And we have an end date of July 9th. <strong>You call that chickening out because we have 14 trillion dollars now invested, committed to investing; When Biden didn't have practically anything, Biden, this country was dying.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote>You know, <strong>we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. I went to Saudi Arabia. The king told me</strong>, he said, \"You got the hottest c.”- We have the hottest country in the world right now. Six months ago, this country was stone cold dead. We had a dead country. <strong>We had a country people didn't think it was going to survive.\"</strong> And you ask a nasty question like that. <strong>Uh it's called negotiation. You set a number and if you go down</strong>, you know, if <strong>I set a number at a ridiculous high number and I go down a little bit, </strong>you know, a little bit, they want me to hold that number. 145% tariff. <strong>Even I said, \"Man, that really got up.\" You know how it got? Because of fentanyl and many other things.</strong> And you added it up. I said, \"Where are we now? We're at 145%.\" I said, \"Woo, that's high. That's high.\" They were doing no business whatsoever.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>And they were having a lot of problems. We were very nice to China. I don't know if they're going to be nice to us, but we were very nice to China. And in many ways, I think we really helped China tremendously because, you know, they were having great difficulty because we were basically going cold turkey with China. We were doing no business because of the tariff, because it was so high. <strong>But I knew that. But don't ever say what you said. That's a nasty question. </strong>Go ahead. To me, that's the nastiest question.&nbsp; [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>Despite this reporter tempting fate, so far “TACO” is holding. Yet, we also haven’t <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/anna-wong-empty-shelves-are-coming-soon?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>seen empty shelves</u></a> that seem to be coming.

I was going to put out this piece laying out what my plans for Notes on the Crises out last Sunday, but alas I got sick more than a week ago and it took me more than a week to recover.\n\nWhich, I guess, is a good place to start. I’ve been working on average at least 60 hours a week since the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis started January 31st. Probably closer to 70 hours if I’m honest. I’ve done a lot to manage my health and keep myself sane in this process; what I got sick with was unrelated to how much I have been working. Nevertheless, the reality is this amount of work is unsustainable in general. The past week of being sick is the longest continuous break I’ve taken from work since the second Trump administration started. Sooner or later I will crash if I try to keep up the depth and breadth of coverage I’ve (more or less) sustained on my own. As long as Notes on the Crises is just a name for what Nathan Tankus is writing, it will always be subject to these kinds of hiccups. Which is why I want to grow Notes on the Crises beyond the \"Nathan Tankus show\".\n\nYet, what Notes on the Crises has become a vehicle for is absolutely essential. My work has been cited in congressional letters, multi-state attorney general lawsuits, and gotten citation and acknowledgement across the media landscape. I’ve been everywhere. As I covered a few weeks ago, New York City’s lawsuit of the Trump administration over debiting New York City’s bank account for 80.5 billion dollars of congressionally appropriated funds was completely rewritten based on the memo I commissioned for my second Rolling Stone piece.\n\nI would like to get to the point where Notes on the Crises is still functioning when I’m out of commission. Or, god forbid, during a vacation. To make Notes on the Crises sustainable, I need to either expand or do less. I chose expansion when I signed a lease on this office last month.\n\nHence why I made the leap to not just renting an office near my apartment but renting 2000 square feet. I got a great deal and I could not pass up the opportunity. One of the things I am doing with the Notes on the Crises office is creating a place for people to gather and talk about our various, well, crises. I also wanted to facilitate many people collaborating together on overlapping projects regarding this constitutional crisis. It's a lot easier to ask someone a question, or get their input, when they are in the same physical space. \n\nAt the same time, I am nowhere close to the financial- or administrative- position to hire people. Instead, I’m setting up the office to have many desks with external monitors, keyboards and mice that can be connected to a laptop with just one USB C wire (and a bluetooth connection). This way people can come in and out of the space to work as they please and I can benefit from conversations and insights with many many people. These people range from other journalists, to volunteers, freelancers and beyond. I am going to have two offices dedicated to these desks, which readers will see photos of when they are completed.\n\nThis Notes on the Crises office is also in the process of becoming a place for undergraduates, graduate students and law students to gather and intern this summer, as well as in the fall. Some of these interns may even write guest pieces for Notes on the Crises based on what I have them researching! Newsletter writing is a lonely affair and there is no place in New York City to go get- for free!- intellectual engagement on the array of topics I have gained expertise on; Let alone intellectual engagement at the intersection of all this different expertise. No place, that is, until now. A media publication with a physical office in Manhattan is, to say the least, not something one does in isolation.\n\nMost importantly though, I’m already expanding my coverage in ways that the office facilitates. Anisha Steephen, former senior adviser to the Treasury under Biden, is starting a multi-part series on the Internal Revenue Service and DOGE’s attacks upon it for Notes on the Crises. This series exemplifies the reasons I chose expansion over shrinking. I asked for IRS sources way back on February 18th. I quickly got a half dozen former and current sources but got too overwhelmed by the labor involved in learning from these sources and continuing my other reporting. However, I never forgot about this essential part of the Federal Government and had been on the look out for someone to take on IRS coverage. Anisha Steephen is the perfect person but, frankly, I am getting the benefit of their expertise only because of their sense of public duty. Snapping up other people like Anisha will require greater financial resources. \n\nMeanwhile, I’m also going to be doing much more audio/video “content” from the office. For one thing, my personal office’s book shelf serves as a far better background. More importantly though, I plan to have more open-ended conversations with guests recorded in my conference room. I’m even contemplating getting into “livestreaming” and answering Notes on the Crises reader questions live “on stream”. The Krugman interviews make clear that there are many, many people who get a lot more out of open-ended conversations about my writing than the writing itself- which is a good thing! I write both for a broader audience and to inform journalists, government employees, law firms and yes, even Wall Street about the extraordinary dangers most people are asleep to. It’s a very tricky balance to strike and talking directly to that broader audience is, in some sense, a relief. Those Krugman interviews have, incidentally, led to Notes on the Crises becoming “monetized” on Youtube. Thus frequent office livestreams, chopped up into many Youtube videos, will add another revenue stream.\n\nTo expand coverage to other government agencies I will need a combination of new business models and more funding. Notes on the Crises has an extremely exciting expansion plan involving a publication that already exists and a unique business model that will be announced in June. This will open my coverage up to multiple important agencies I have not touched with my writing so far. It will also fit extremely well with my intention to get into livestreaming for reasons that will become clear. Reader support has also made this opportunity one I could take advantage of. A website redesign \n\nTo get to the point where I can afford to have people working full time on various beats I need to branch out while still accumulating a bedrock foundation of paid subscribers. They are what let me take chances like the ones I have in the works and to have the safety net to take other opportunities. Some of those opportunities will be grants or donations. Readers may recall this surreal interaction towards the end of Paul Krugman’s first interview with me:\n\nKrugman: Yeah, I was actually wondering who they'd leak it to if not you. I mean, if you get hit by a truck, how do we know if this has happened?\n\nTankus: Well, I'll put this pitch out there. If someone out there who's watching this or reading the transcript wants to put up a budget, $500,000 or a million to train up people and, you know, make me replaceable, I'm more than eager to train up my redundancies. \n\nKrugman: This will be in the transcript. That's actually, it is scary.\n\nI can’t talk about my efforts here in detail until they fully bear fruit, but getting those kinds of dollar amounts ultimately requires new organizational relationships (if you would be interested in making a donation to a 501(c)(3) to support Notes on the Crises Investigative Journalism and/or research, email me at crisesnotes@gmail.com to discuss further). \n\nI am also going to start doing ticketed in-person Notes on the Crises events. These will involve various levels and audiences, with my highest end events held at special places like the American Numismatic Society where I get to, among other things, show off monetary objects throughout history. In fact, I have tickets to sell for an event just this week. I would have let free subscribers get a chance to buy them a full week ago but … I got sick. Expansion is about getting many of these tasks out of my hands. (Free email subscribers will get an email offering to buy tickets, along with the details regarding the event, shortly).\n\nThis is kind of a tricky position to engage readers from. On one hand, I’m saying that Notes on the Crises needs to reach financial resources beyond my current audience’s subscriptions. At the same time, I’m telling you, the reader, that your subscription is absolutely essential. Your subscription helps keep Notes on the Crises completely independent from potential grantors, donors or wealthy subscribers. Reader subscriptions give me the security of knowing that I can always turn down money-with-strings and still be able to support this office and compensate freelance writers. That absolute independence, combined with my current and former governmental sources, as well as my unique knowledge base, are the special ingredients which make Notes on the Crises such a powerful force.\n\nThe big picture here is that, while expanding Notes on the Crises is exciting, I’m not doing it for myself. In many ways it would have been easier, more comfortable even, to just take the rise in subscriptions as a nice windfall- a reward for years of hard work. Take one of those aforementioned vacations. The reason I didn’t make that decision is that the very thing leading to paid subscriptions for Notes on the Crises have been the things that have motivated me to work so hard. We are still in the middle of an intensifying constitutional crisis. This constitutional crisis involves many obscure, hard to understand systems that our media ecosystem is not equipped to handle. \n\nThere are so many unfinished threads just from what I’ve covered so far. I think I’ve stumbled upon something that needs to exist in the world. Something bigger than myself which, with the right resources, can be unfurled from my mind and become dossiers and rulebooks for investigative research and journalism. I want to be able to, someday, say that even if I get “hit by a truck”, a government employee can still leak to Notes on the Crises and someone will know what to do with the information. Every move I have made since the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis started-and will make from here on out- is with that central goal in mind. We’ve made a lot of progress in the past 40 days or so since the lease started and I’m confident that Notes on the Crises will continue to thrive: thanks to your help and support. The enthusiasm- and paid subscriptions- of my readers are what made this audacious leap thinkable, so thank you.","html":"<p></p><p>I have been very overdue in telling readers my plans in greater detail. I was going to put out this piece laying out what my plans for <em>Notes on the Crises</em> out last Sunday, but alas I got sick more than a week ago and it took me more than a week to recover.</p><p>Which, I guess, is a good place to start. I’ve been working on average at least 60 hours a week since the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/liquidity-volatility-and-market-craziness-paul-krugman-interviews-nathan-tankus-again/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Trump-Musk Payments Crisis</a> started January 31st. Probably closer to 70 hours if I’m honest. I’ve done a lot to manage my health and keep myself sane in this process; what I got sick with was unrelated to how much I have been working. Nevertheless, the reality is this amount of work is unsustainable in general. The past week of being sick is the longest continuous break I’ve taken from work since the second Trump administration started. Sooner or later I will crash if I try to keep up the depth and breadth of coverage I’ve (more or less) sustained on my own. As long as <em>Notes on the Crises</em> is just a name for what Nathan Tankus is writing, it will always be subject to these kinds of hiccups. Which is why I want to grow Notes on the Crises beyond the \"Nathan Tankus show\". </p><p>Yet, what <em>Notes on the Crises</em> has become a vehicle for is absolutely essential. My work has been cited in <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>congressional letters, multi-state attorney general lawsuits</u></a>, and gotten citation and acknowledgement across the media landscape. I’ve been everywhere. As I covered <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/new-york-citys-trump-administration-lawsuit-was-fundamentally-amended-based-on-notes-on-the-crises-memo-no-1/\"><u>a few weeks ago</u></a>, New York City’s lawsuit of the Trump administration over<u> </u><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/can-the-trump-administration-arbitrarily-take-money-from-anyones-bank-account/\"><u>debiting New York City’s bank account</u></a> for 80.5 billion dollars of <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>congressionally appropriated funds</u></a> was completely rewritten based on the memo I commissioned for my <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/can-the-trump-administration-arbitrarily-take-money-from-anyones-bank-account/\"><u>second <em>Rolling Stone</em> piece</u></a>.</p><p>I would like to get to the point where <em>Notes on the Crises</em> is still functioning when I’m out of commission. Or, god forbid, during a vacation. To make <em>Notes on the Crises</em> sustainable, I need to either expand or do less. I chose expansion when I signed a lease on this office last month.</p><p>Hence why I made the leap to not just renting an office near my apartment but <strong>renting 2000 square feet</strong>. I got a great deal and I could not pass up the opportunity. One of the things I am doing with the <em>Notes on the Crises</em> office is creating a place for people to gather and talk about our various, well, <strong>crises</strong>. I also wanted to facilitate many people collaborating together on overlapping projects regarding this constitutional crisis. It's a lot easier to ask someone a question, or get their input, when they are in the same physical space.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXciAQ1QmQ-BiRpeQapPQVScJ2O_d0eR_usT0hJ5k8gu-mlH-ZPH44WmAW1X1oJfBAJe7xa21uuWGXFOLQzu9Q6ta2p1uoh3bwZf0y5TGqRCfTAwzL7FIpsL1dPT6GDsAaIPNekmXQ?key=xPOG5NVPSnzV2qkVeMnlng\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"468\"></figure><p>At the same time, <strong>I am nowhere close to the financial- or administrative- position to hire people</strong>. Instead, I’m setting up the office to have many desks with external monitors, keyboards and mice that can be connected to a laptop with just one USB C wire (and a bluetooth connection). This way people can come in and out of the space to work as they please and I can benefit from conversations and insights with many many people. These people range from other journalists, to volunteers, freelancers and beyond. I am going to have two offices dedicated to these desks, which readers will see photos of when they are completed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd1auXm2C2UjgW80YsEYWST0iD8bXAwLN12gwkEy5ZJt0hOnUCq595VY0PRCyB_un4ltcV0h0eCWfXifR_ZAr4iNBsoMeY5Ywf6bav6-qJ994Z4jA0MmXQ5g9gmH-EBb1m_8vjR?key=xPOG5NVPSnzV2qkVeMnlng\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"468\"></figure><p>This <em>Notes on the Crises</em> office is also in the process of becoming a place for undergraduates, graduate students and law students to gather and intern this summer, as well as in the fall. Some of these interns may even write guest pieces for <em>Notes on the Crises</em> based on what I have them researching! Newsletter writing is a lonely affair and there is no place in New York City to go get- for free!- intellectual engagement on the array of topics I have gained expertise on; Let alone intellectual engagement at the intersection of all this different expertise. No place, that is, <strong>until now</strong>. A media publication with a physical office in Manhattan is, to say the least, not something one does in isolation.</p><p>Most importantly though, I’m already expanding my coverage in ways that the office facilitates. <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/asteephen.bsky.social?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Anisha Steephen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>former senior adviser to the Treasury</u></a> under Biden, is starting a multi-part series on the Internal Revenue Service and DOGE’s attacks upon it for <em>Notes on the Crises</em>. This series exemplifies the reasons I chose expansion over shrinking. I asked for IRS sources <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/special-notice-doge-is-now-going-after-the-irs-which-means-i-need-former-and-current-irs-sources-especially-cobol-programmers/\"><u>way back on February 18th</u></a>. I quickly got a half dozen former and current sources but got too overwhelmed by the labor involved in learning from these sources and continuing my other reporting. However, I never forgot about this essential part of the Federal Government and had been on the look out for someone to take on IRS coverage. Anisha Steephen is the perfect person but, frankly, I am getting the benefit of their expertise only because of their sense of public duty. Snapping up other people like Anisha will require greater financial resources.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeOiEZT-ifKYv3g92fySZPAg1F-BTB746Yqu3QNQjQd1paht-WqFNm7W3qfG_Nwq-cP1gY7YcNxtHZUqNSwPeZoTTFsRH-6M26rbPbZXEnu-GNH0Hjq1jLGWiBncMwp8BLwGy9X3A?key=xPOG5NVPSnzV2qkVeMnlng\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"468\"></figure><p>Meanwhile, I’m also going to be doing much more audio/video “content” from the office. For one thing, my personal office’s book shelf serves as a far better background. More importantly though, I plan to have more open-ended conversations with guests recorded in my conference room. I’m even contemplating getting into “livestreaming” and answering <em>Notes on the Crises</em> reader questions live “on stream”. The Krugman interviews make clear that there are many, many people who get a lot more out of open-ended conversations about my writing than the writing itself- which is a good thing! I write both for a broader audience and to inform journalists, government employees, law firms and yes, even Wall Street about the extraordinary dangers most people are asleep to. It’s a very tricky balance to strike and talking directly to that broader audience is, in some sense, a relief. Those Krugman interviews have, incidentally, led to <em>Notes on the Crises </em>becoming <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@crisesnotes?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“monetized” on Youtube</u></a>. Thus frequent office livestreams, chopped up into many Youtube videos, will add another revenue stream.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdQOyShUTNfmyka8zq9CvGfXG2B1YNYJSyiC2aTsKTZZrvGxJORgoct7KEyONkXNtrsTCXdrdoJuSBmgbjI7tMG2S-mB47k-Spcjg5PXMa8WFg07dhDgLihJStykcJyLppD45Vq?key=xPOG5NVPSnzV2qkVeMnlng\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"468\"></figure><p>To expand coverage to other government agencies I will need a combination of new business models and more funding. <em>Notes on the Crises</em> has an extremely exciting expansion plan involving a publication that already exists and a unique business model that will be announced in June. This will open my coverage up to multiple important agencies I have not touched with my writing so far. It will also fit extremely well with my intention to get into livestreaming for reasons that will become clear. Reader support has also made this opportunity one I could take advantage of. A website redesign&nbsp;</p><p>To get to the point where I can afford to have people working full time on various beats I need to branch out while still accumulating a bedrock foundation of paid subscribers. They are what let me take chances like the ones I have in the works and to have the safety net to take other opportunities. Some of those opportunities will be grants or donations. Readers may recall this surreal interaction towards the end of Paul Krugman’s <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/musk-in-your-computers-paul-krugman-interviews-nathan-tankus/\"><u>first interview with me</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Krugman: Yeah, I was actually wondering who they'd leak it to if not you. I mean, if you get hit by a truck, how do we know if this has happened?</blockquote><blockquote>Tankus: Well, I'll put this pitch out there. If someone out there who's watching this or reading the transcript wants to put up a budget, $500,000 or a million to train up people and, you know, make me replaceable, I'm more than eager to train up my redundancies.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Krugman: This will be in the transcript. That's actually, it is scary.</blockquote><p>I can’t talk about my efforts here in detail until they fully bear fruit, but getting those kinds of dollar amounts ultimately requires new organizational relationships (if you would be interested in making a donation to a 501(c)(3) to support <em>Notes on the Crises</em> Investigative Journalism and/or research, email me at <a href=\"mailto:crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><u>crisesnotes@gmail.com</u></a> to discuss further).&nbsp;</p><p>I am also going to start doing ticketed in-person <em>Notes on the Crises</em> events. These will involve various levels and audiences, with my highest end events held at special places like the American Numismatic Society where I get to, among other things, show off monetary objects throughout history. In fact, I have tickets to sell for an event just this week. I would have let free subscribers get a chance to buy them a full week ago but … I got sick. Expansion is about getting many of these tasks out of my hands. (Free email subscribers will get an email offering to buy tickets, along with the details regarding the event, shortly).</p><p>This is kind of a tricky position to engage readers from. On one hand, I’m saying that<em> Notes on the Crises</em> needs to reach financial resources beyond my current audience’s subscriptions. At the same time, I’m telling you, the reader, that your subscription is absolutely essential. Your subscription helps keep <em>Notes on the Crises</em> completely independent from potential grantors, donors or wealthy subscribers. Reader subscriptions give me the security of knowing that I can always turn down money-with-strings and still be able to support this office and compensate freelance writers. That absolute independence, combined with my current and former governmental sources, as well as my unique knowledge base, are the special ingredients which make <em>Notes on the Crises</em> such a powerful force.</p><p>The big picture here is that, while expanding <em>Notes on the Crises</em> is exciting, I’m not doing it for myself. In many ways it would have been easier, more comfortable even, to just take the rise in subscriptions as a nice windfall- a reward for years of hard work. Take one of those aforementioned vacations. The reason I didn’t make that decision is that the very thing leading to paid subscriptions for <em>Notes on the Crises</em> have been the things that have motivated me to work so hard. We are still in the middle of an intensifying constitutional crisis. This constitutional crisis involves many obscure, hard to understand systems that our media ecosystem is not equipped to handle.&nbsp;</p><p>There are so many unfinished threads just from what I’ve covered so far. I think I’ve stumbled upon something that needs to exist in the world. Something bigger than myself which, with the right resources, can be unfurled from my mind and become dossiers and rulebooks for investigative research and journalism. I want to be able to, someday, say that even if I get “hit by a truck”, a government employee can still leak to <em>Notes on the Crises</em> and someone will know what to do with the information. Every move I have made since the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis started-and will make from here on out- is with that central goal in mind. We’ve made a lot of progress in the past 40 days or so since the lease started and I’m confident that <em>Notes on the Crises</em> will continue to thrive: thanks to your help and support. The enthusiasm- and paid subscriptions- of my readers are what made this audacious leap thinkable, so thank you.</p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-does-notes-on-the-crises-have-a-manhattan-office-now-a-blueprint-for-the-future/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"6860b210-8d8f-4a53-9f17-6fb332268988","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"6834858501f31e0001ebbefa","reading_time":8}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"May 13","id":"Ghost__Post__6822b65cf42ab80001aa6c2a","title":"Can China “Buy” America?

Just yesterday China and the United States announced a tariff agreement- at least for the next ninety days. But the other reason I haven’t put out a big picture piece on the dollar is I have struggled to put all my thoughts on this topic into one piece. Before the coronavirus pandemic- when I was in a very different place in my life- my goal was to go off to undertake a PhD in law in Europe where I would write a three chapter dissertation on the international law of money. My June 2018 talk which I published in the newsletter last month provides the rough skeleton of my thinking. How do you get all of that into one piece?\n\nWhich brings me to what I’m writing about today. The week the Trump Tariff Financial Crisis broke out I began watching Fox News during prime time each day. I’ve long tried to periodically catch up with Fox News because the stories on Fox News do not appear anywhere else and are key to understanding the right wing political spectrum in the United States. I have a very vivid memory of first encountering Vivek Ramaswamy- who was very briefly co-head of DOGE- by watching Fox News in late April 2023. Most importantly Fox News is the main media source President Donald Trump watches so if you want to have some insight into his thinking, Fox News is a crucial source. This is especially true because Trump officials, including Trump himself, influence what Fox covers by directly talking and cajoling it. \n\nTurning back to the Trump Tariff Financial Crisis, the most interesting segment on Fox News I watched that week was a Tuesday, April 8th segment entitled “Saving Capitalism” at the start of “The Ingraham Angle” with Laura Ingraham. Watching this segment was what fully convinced me that the tariffs on China would go into effect at midnight.  I began writing Wednesday morning’s piece with that conviction in mind before going out to a friend’s birthday party. I started heading back home around midnight and caught up with the fact that the financial stresses I had started to write about had already begun leading to various different financial dislocations.\n\nBut that I’ve already covered. What I noted in my head at the time, and I’m writing up in today’s piece, was the longer historical narrative Ingraham painted. She hammered on Trump’s rhetoric that these sudden global tariff moves were the “last chance” to save the American “middle class”. One key focal point of her narrative was that by running trade surpluses with the United States China could accumulate dollars and “buy America”. I found this so interesting because these fears have recurred over the last 50 years, but the Fox News narrative neatly cuts out that this is a solved problem. In fact, it was solved by an institution created exactly 50 years ago last Wednesday.\n\nWhen OPEC quadrupled its posted oil price more than fifty years ago, and subsequently major oil exporters began to run large trade surpluses, Americans quickly fretted about the power of these countries. The symbol of the danger in this new world order was a stereotyped caricature invariably labeled Saudi Arabia. One major component of this worry was the ability of OPEC countries to “buy up America”. I think it’s interesting how much fear the United States has had of foreign control given the dominance the United States has had over other countries. But that’s a question for the psychologists, not technical economic policy analysis.\n\nOne of the best books on this topic I’m familiar with is a 2018 book by Georgetown professor Ashley Lenihan named “Balancing Power without Weapons: State Intervention into Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions”. As the book recounts, president Gerald Ford created by Executive Order 11858 of May 7, 1975 the interagency Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States” (CFIUS) and empowered it to regulate foreign direct investment. As Linehan recounts, the Ford administration CFIUS was created “in response to mounting concern over a rise in foreign investment from states within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which was feared to be politically motivated in the aftermath of OPEC’s 1973–74 oil embargo”.\n\nThis interagency body, chaired by the Treasury secretary, can simply stop overseas mergers and acquisitions of companies, purchases of real estate and even significant minority purchases of the stocks of a single company. Just like with Index Funds, foreign governmental entities are required to be “passive” investors and not attempt to actively control a company. When Sovereign Wealth Funds first came to prominence two decades ago, the United States quickly launched into action to establish a “global framework” for how Sovereign Wealth Funds behaved and to ensure their “passivity”. \n\nCFIUS initially prevented foreign direct investment into companies with sensitive national security technologies and, over time, increasingly disfavored investments in all sorts of companies because of vaguer and broader “economic security” concerns. While CFIUS was created by executive order, the presidency gained additional powers which it could delegate to CFIUS in the following decades. The 1980s fears of Japan “owning America” led to new statutes which granted new powers and even required certain kinds of national security reviews of mergers and acquisitions. Above all CFIUS dissuades foreign entities, especially foreign governments, from buying controlling shares of U.S. companies. In fact, there is already a long history of using CFIUS to prevent the acquisition of various “strategic assets” and companies by China. Professor Lenihan’s book is filled with an enormous amount of discussion- and policy history- on CFIUS and China.\n\nThis no doubt is an important structural contributor to the subpar performance of foreign equity investment into U.S. companies relative to U.S. subsidiaries and equity investments abroad. Thus, not only do we already prevent other countries from using dollars to take control of key strategic resources, we parlay that into an overall financial advantage. Put simply, the United States profits from control of foreign resources without allowing foreign control of domestic resources. The only “cost” was allowing open access to selling goods and services in the United States. The very limitations these foreign countries are subject to opens up the question “is it even really costly for the U.S. to run trade deficits?” Unfortunately, that question brings us back to the overall question of the dollar which is beyond today’s scope.\n\nSome might object to my characterization here based on the fact that CFIUS only looks over and examines a small amount of the total mergers and acquisitions and generally does not have a large scale. What this argument misses is the very existence of CFIUS, and the statutes that lie behind this, dissuades foreign countries and companies from engaging in economic activity they otherwise would in the absence of this regulatory regime. You only have to look at the purchases and acquisitions the United States, and U.S. companies, make abroad to see the difference.\n\nWhat does all this mean for the second Trump administration? The way I look at it, the attempts to make Trump’s approach to world economic policy make sense requires ignoring the long and storied history of the Federal Government. Trump wanted to press a button to make trade deficits go away- causing global financial stress in the process and emptying our shelves in the process. Little does he know that the U.S. federal government long ago built buttons to make the accumulation of dollars by foreign countries benign. But imagine trying to explain CFIUS to a Fox news audience.","html":"<div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>I have ended up taking a lot longer to write up my biggest picture thoughts on the dollar than I initially expected.

I found this so interesting because these fears have recurred over the last 50 years, but the Fox News narrative neatly cuts out that this is a <strong>solved problem.</strong> In fact, it was solved by an institution created exactly 50 years ago last Wednesday.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXctVxp4awugrXhR0bcor8fCegpgbU4m6uECsNONWaTRsIQYz1shMRRxQmF48JpRJp3hygyCQiAlT_KLHMS5H0oBcR1yYyalihvp_GLjuYw6d8B4IVeaY9Wx2V2Gl2HVsmGqXkeOMA?key=lmbeRPUOoAwd9LLkG2vQcOJb\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"508\"></figure><p>When OPEC quadrupled its posted oil price more than fifty years ago, and subsequently major oil exporters began to run large trade surpluses, Americans quickly fretted about the power of these countries.

One major component of this worry was the ability of OPEC countries to “buy up America”. I think it’s interesting how much fear the United States has had of foreign control given the dominance the United States has had over other countries. But that’s a question for the psychologists, not technical economic policy analysis.</p><p>One of the best books on this topic I’m familiar with is a 2018 book by <a href=\"https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000015ahJLAAY/ashley-lenihan-phd?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Georgetown professor </u></a>Ashley Lenihan named <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/3FF55939BC6F62A229896901915C3131/9781107181861AR.pdf/Balancing_Power_without_Weapons.pdf?event-type=FTLA&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“Balancing Power without Weapons: State Intervention into Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions”</u></a>. As the book recounts, president Gerald Ford <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/11858.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>created by Executive Order 11858 of May 7, 1975</u></a> the interagency Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States” (CFIUS) and empowered it to regulate foreign direct investment. As Linehan recounts, the Ford administration CFIUS was created “in response to mounting concern over a rise in foreign investment from states within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which was feared to be politically motivated in the aftermath of OPEC’s 1973–74 oil embargo”.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdFxh0M2VmuL9Z6rmn-gBtglKnB04Xytd5QgQMzNnm0GCGMDHfO_zR3JuTeuEo02zCVewysz0gosBrWcsxJKppMyE5Dq9HIM-I4P9TJWb7dne0sNey21wNIQRDtSRZ7noCM_K2oCQ?key=lmbeRPUOoAwd9LLkG2vQcOJb\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"283\"></figure><p>This interagency body, <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/international/the-committee-on-foreign-investment-in-the-united-states-cfius/cfius-overview?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>chaired by the Treasury secretary</u></a>, can simply stop overseas mergers and acquisitions of companies, purchases of real estate and even significant minority purchases of the stocks of a single company. Just like with Index Funds, foreign governmental entities are required to be “passive” investors and not attempt to actively control a company. When Sovereign Wealth Funds first came to prominence two decades ago, the United States quickly launched into action to establish a <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/hp1174?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“global framework” for how Sovereign Wealth Funds behaved and to ensure their “passivity”</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>CFIUS initially prevented foreign direct investment into companies with sensitive national security technologies and, over time, increasingly disfavored investments in all sorts of companies because of vaguer and broader “economic security” concerns. While CFIUS was created by executive order, the presidency gained additional powers which it could delegate to CFIUS in the following decades. The 1980s fears of Japan “owning America” led to new statutes which granted new powers and even required certain kinds of national security reviews of mergers and acquisitions. Above all CFIUS dissuades foreign entities, especially foreign governments, from buying controlling shares of U.S. companies. In fact, there is already a long history of using CFIUS to prevent the acquisition of various “strategic assets” and companies by China. Professor Lenihan’s book is filled with an enormous amount of discussion- and policy history- on CFIUS and China.</p><p>This no doubt is an important structural contributor to <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24915652?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the subpar performance of foreign equity</u></a> investment into U.S. companies relative to U.S. subsidiaries and equity investments abroad. Thus, not only do we already prevent other countries from using dollars to take control of key strategic resources, we parlay that into an overall financial advantage. Put simply, the United States profits from control of foreign resources without allowing foreign control of domestic resources. The only “cost” was allowing open access to selling goods and services in the United States. The very limitations these foreign countries are subject to opens up the question “is it even really costly for the U.S. to run trade deficits?” Unfortunately, that question brings us back to the overall question of the dollar which is beyond today’s scope.</p><p>Some might object to my characterization here based on the fact that CFIUS only looks over and examines a small amount of the total mergers and acquisitions and generally does not have a large scale. What this argument misses is the very existence of CFIUS, and the statutes that lie behind this, dissuades foreign countries and companies from engaging in economic activity they otherwise would in the absence of this regulatory regime. You only have to look at the purchases and acquisitions the United States, and U.S. companies, make abroad to see the difference.</p><p>What does all this mean for the second Trump administration? The way I look at it, the attempts to make Trump’s approach to world economic policy make sense requires ignoring the long and storied history of the Federal Government. Trump wanted to press a button to make trade deficits go away- causing global financial stress in the process and emptying our shelves in the process. Little does he know that the U.S. federal government long ago built buttons to make the accumulation of dollars by foreign countries benign. But imagine trying to explain CFIUS to a Fox news audience.</p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/cfius50anniversary/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"934c032a-84b7-47fa-ad76-e9e39753bed7","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"6822b65cf42ab80001aa6c2a","reading_time":5}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"May 9","id":"Ghost__Post__681d8a060f44f800017eb039","title":"New York City’s Trump Administration Lawsuit Was Fundamentally Amended Based on Notes on the Crises Memo No. 1","slug":"new-york-citys-trump-administration-lawsuit-was-fundamentally-amended-based-on-notes-on-the-crises-memo-no-1","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/05/NYC-Trump-Lawsuit-amended.png","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b80808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/cb362673548cba85a74f36c7f4240418/26b3e/NYC-Trump-Lawsuit-amended.png","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/cb362673548cba85a74f36c7f4240418/34690/NYC-Trump-Lawsuit-amended.png 399w,\n/migrantinsider/static/cb362673548cba85a74f36c7f4240418/bb4bc/NYC-Trump-Lawsuit-amended.png 799w,\n/migrantinsider/static/cb362673548cba85a74f36c7f4240418/26b3e/NYC-Trump-Lawsuit-amended.png 1597w","sizes":"(min-width: 1597px) 1597px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/cb362673548cba85a74f36c7f4240418/0b373/NYC-Trump-Lawsuit-amended.webp 399w,\n/migrantinsider/static/cb362673548cba85a74f36c7f4240418/a8c6a/NYC-Trump-Lawsuit-amended.webp 799w,\n/migrantinsider/static/cb362673548cba85a74f36c7f4240418/bae66/NYC-Trump-Lawsuit-amended.webp 1597w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1597px) 1597px, 100vw"}]},"width":1597,"height":830}}},"excerpt":"I have a lot of writing to get out over the next couple of weeks, especially following up on the Trump Tariff Crisis and the Future of the Dollar.

I also need to dig back into the state of play at the Bureau of Fiscal Service. Today however, it's important to document signs of the impact Notes on the Crises is already having. One major sign I’ve had my eye on is the impact of my March 13 piece, published simultaneously in this newsletter and Rolling Stone, on New York City’s lawsuit against the Trump administration over its so-called “clawback” of 80.5 million dollars of congressionally appropriated FEMA funds. \n\nReads might recall that starting with that piece Notes on the Crises has begun commissioning legal research memos on obscure and technical legal issues. My article two weeks ago about the Social Security Administration’s “Death Master File” was accompanied by a memo on the legal rules related to the so-called “Reclamation of Social Security Benefits”. I plan on continuing to commission legal research memos when I think it's relevant or important to my reporting and the issue at hand.\n\nThat first memo by Ashley Burke, on the “Federal Government Use of the Automated Clearing House System”, was far more important than I emphasized at the time. As far as anyone I know is aware, that memo is the only publicly available memo on the topic. To understand how that could possibly be true, it's important to take a step back and talk more abstractly about how “law” is organized. \n\nAt a fundamental level, law is the daily set of practices a variety of actors- both lawyers and non-lawyers alike- engage in that are either subject to, or consciously withdrawn from, formal dispute resolution. That’s a careful, dare I say lawyerly, definition. So let's break this down. We all engage in legal practices every day. Even not littering is a kind of legal practice insofar as we are doing it to avoid getting a ticket- i.e. incurring a legal liability. There are also a variety of ways that legal liabilities- both criminal and civil- are both created, disputed and resolved. The most obvious one is a judicial court- think the end of every Law & Order episode. \n\nThere are, however, all sorts of courts. There are administrative law courts which handle cases under a government agency’s jurisdiction. There are also forms of “dispute resolution” which are not handled by courts at all. There is arbitration- nowadays regularly made mandatory for consumers by corporations when buying their products. There is also mediation negotiation and conciliation whose purposes are to create agreement and avoid adjudication. While we all engage in legal practices lawyers, by virtue of their government issued licenses, are privileged legal actors in the legal system.\n\nThe point of clarifying this is to bring readers along to help see things from the “lawyer” point of view. While lawyers are privileged relative to the rest of us, they all have “the same” license. So what gives one advantage over another? You could say education, skill or knowledge. You could say their rhetorical skills in the courtroom or in negotiations. There is truth to all of this. But one of the most important, and most underemphasized, is the value of experience regarding confidential matters. More specifically, their confidential legal memos accumulated over years- maybe even decades. If all of the internal legal memos- and copies of confidential legal documents from other cases- were suddenly published online for free from the archives of all the biggest law firms in the world, the value these firms provide their clients would be devastated. \n\nWhich brings me back to Notes on the Crises Legal Research Memorandum No.1. That memo was the first public memo documenting the legal rules that define how the federal government engages the Automated Clearing House system because any other memo which documents these issues are buried in the files of either Federal agencies or the top law firms. Or, of course, the National Automated Clearing House Association (Nacha) which plays a major part in defining the rules. These law firms do best on obscure issues that only they could devote the resources to having expertise on in preparation for a crisis- or even just an unusual event. This pattern played out during the 2008 Great Financial Crisis.\n\nThis is, of course, a structural problem in our system. It is, however, a burgeoning crisis in and of itself since the beginning of the second Trump administration. As Trump- and DOGE- throw the federal government into chaos, it also throws government employees' more typical relationship with their own legal counsels into chaos. We are entering a dangerous moment where obscure legal issues are coming to the forefront at the same time that government employees at every level find themselves less able- or willing- to access their traditional sources of legal advice. \n\nI’ve been thinking about this problem since almost the beginning of the crisis and, with my second Rolling Stone article, I saw the opportunity to chart a unique strategy to respond to it. By publishing freely accessible legal research memoranda, I could make sure good information is getting to government employees. It also makes it easier to get legal advice itself. These legal research memos themselves are not, and cannot be, legal advice. However, they can form the basis of official legal opinions of government lawyers. It is also a lot easier to hand a public memo to agency legal counsel and say “what do you think of this?” than to advocate the construction of novel legal theories your lawyers have no familiarity with. \n\nWhich finally brings me to the point of this piece. Several weeks ago it came to my attention that New York City’s lawsuit against the Trump administration over the FEMA “clawbacks” had been amended with a wealth of detail about the Automated Clearing House system. While I didn’t have time to look into it, I asked an anonymous lawyer to do so on my behalf. Today I’m publishing the result as Notes on the Crises Legal Research Memorandum No. 3. This memo is about “ACH Amendments to Complaint in City of New York v. Trump (1:25-cv-01510)”.\n\nThe memo is 7 pages, but for those who are uninterested in the legal detail the takeaway is straightforward and can be summarized by quoting a few paragraphs from the memo itself:\n\nAs compared with the initial Complaint—which mentioned ACH only once in reference to the initial deposit of the $80.5 million in the City’s central treasury account—the Amended Complaint discusses ACH at length in nearly every section. The Introduction, Facts, Claims for Relief, and Prayer for Relief all depend on a thorough and detailed understanding of the rules that govern the ACH system to make a case for the return of the $80.5 million to New York City. [...]\n\nSeven days after the publication of NOTC Memo No. 1, the City filed an Amended Complaint containing a nuanced legal theory based on the rules and regulations that govern the federal government’s use of the ACH system. It is possible that Hamilton’s reference to the ACH reversal in his February 28, 2025 Declaration spurred the City to independently research 31 C.F.R Part 210 and the Nacha Rules. However, prior to the release of the NOTC Memo, the City had only cited 31 C.F.R. Part 210 once in a footnote. \n\nThe federal government’s use of the ACH system is an obscure, complicated topic. The City’s legal team probably had little to no prior knowledge of this body of law. Moreover, NOTC Memo No. 1 appears to be the first publicly available analysis of the rules that structure the federal government’s use of ACH. Even if the City did not rely entirely on NOTC Memo No. 1 for its ACH research, without the groundwork laid by the memo, the City might not have been willing or able to devote the resources needed to craft the sophisticated ACH-related arguments that now reinforce the Claims for Relief in the Amended Complaint.” [emphasis added]\n\nIn short, the very first legal research memo Notes on the Crises published had a profound impact on New York City government’s lawsuit of the Trump administration. It's hard to overstate the magnitude of that impact. The legal research in that memo is relevant to- at minimum- thousands of state and local governments and every agency of the federal government. It's also relevant to non-profits and, unfortunately, it's increasingly relevant to individuals. It is also now the “conventional wisdom” among lawyers who are interested in this issue- which means all existing legal memos on this topic will have to be updated to reflect its contents.  I’m providing this incredibly impactful legal research for free while raising the alarm about the issue in the press. This extraordinary impact I’ve managed to have has come from a publication that was a “one man” newsletter three months ago- and still primarily is.\n\nAs readers have gotten hints of, I’m now in the process of expanding into a fully fledged publication. I have a 2000 square foot office which will become a gathering place for people to help. Paid subscriptions from my 2900 subscribers (and counting) are what have made that possible. I’m pursuing a number of different avenues to gain the revenue I can plow right back into expanding investigative reporting. You will hear about those avenues in greater detail soon. However the foundation of a publication is its paid subscribers. It provides the stability and the reliability needed to make major leaps into the unknown. Thank you to those who are supporting that work, and for those that aren’t- please consider doing so. Much larger entities are doing far less with far more.","html":"<p></p><p>I have a lot of writing to get out over the next couple of weeks, especially following up on the Trump Tariff Crisis and the Future of the Dollar.

Trump (1:25-cv-01510)”.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfT1rlAgjfQVPUsFz2244-4nQgEfRcYVT7UIa_8v9SHGPt_8UJqeDxL-RlXm8xrrQDkP9aLEZKAn0hqaMsC65TfDUYcoyuidfe7O7vpPSIamiOGvdOPH6afmuf4gM524lWv8oPH-A?key=xCkkNWWnHULZgZ6rZ3-szA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"732\"></figure><p>The memo is 7 pages, but for those who are uninterested in the legal detail the takeaway is straightforward and can be summarized by quoting a few paragraphs from the memo itself:</p><blockquote>As compared with the initial Complaint—<strong>which mentioned ACH only once</strong> in reference to the initial deposit of the $80.5 million in the City’s central treasury account—the Amended Complaint discusses ACH at length in nearly every section. The Introduction, Facts, Claims for Relief, and Prayer for Relief all depend on a thorough and detailed understanding of the rules that govern the ACH system to make a case for the return of the $80.5 million to New York City. [...]</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Seven days after the publication of NOTC Memo No. 1</strong>, the City filed an Amended Complaint <strong>containing a nuanced legal theory based on the rules and regulations that govern the federal government’s use of the ACH system</strong>. It is possible that Hamilton’s reference to the ACH reversal in his February 28, 2025 Declaration spurred the City to independently research 31 C.F.R Part 210 and the Nacha Rules. However, <strong>prior to the release of the NOTC Memo, the City had only cited 31 C.F.R. Part 210 once in a footnote</strong>.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>The federal government’s use of the ACH system is <strong>an obscure, complicated topic</strong>. The City’s legal team p<strong>robably had little to no prior knowledge of this body of law</strong>. Moreover, NOTC Memo No. 1 appears to be the first publicly available analysis of the rules that structure the federal government’s use of ACH. Even if the City did not rely entirely on NOTC Memo No. 1 for its ACH research, <strong>without the groundwork laid by the memo, the City might not have been willing or able to devote the resources needed to craft the sophisticated ACH-related arguments that now reinforce the Claims for Relief in the Amended Complaint</strong>.” [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>In short, the very first legal research memo Notes on the Crises published had a profound impact on New York City government’s lawsuit of the Trump administration. It's hard to overstate the magnitude of that impact. The legal research in that memo is relevant to- at minimum- thousands of state and local governments and every agency of the federal government. It's also relevant to non-profits and, unfortunately, it's increasingly relevant to individuals. It is also now the “conventional wisdom” among lawyers who are interested in this issue- which means all existing legal memos on this topic will have to be updated to reflect its contents.&nbsp; I’m providing this incredibly impactful legal research for free while raising the alarm about the issue in the press. This extraordinary impact I’ve managed to have has come from a publication that was a “one man” newsletter three months ago- and still primarily is.</p><p>As readers have gotten hints of, I’m now in the process of expanding into a fully fledged publication. I have a 2000 square foot office which will become a gathering place for people to help. Paid subscriptions from my 2900 subscribers (and counting) are what have made that possible. I’m pursuing a number of different avenues to gain the revenue I can plow right back into expanding investigative reporting. You will hear about those avenues in greater detail soon. However the foundation of a publication is its paid subscribers. It provides the stability and the reliability needed to make major leaps into the unknown. Thank you to those who are supporting that work, and for those that aren’t- please consider doing so. Much larger entities are doing far less with far more.</p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/new-york-citys-trump-administration-lawsuit-was-fundamentally-amended-based-on-notes-on-the-crises-memo-no-1/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"2ab3e2df-c2c8-432e-ae3d-e6fcae7b18e0","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"681d8a060f44f800017eb039","reading_time":7}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"April 25","id":"Ghost__Post__680bba0e4afbd3000153b0e8","title":"The Crisis at Social Security Illustrates Elon Musk and DOGE’s Plan: Explode the Number and Severity of Improper Payments.","slug":"the-crisis-at-social-security-illustrates-elon-musk-and-doges-plan-explode-the-number-and-severity-of-improper-payments","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/04/Social-Security-Increasing-Improper-Payments-april.png","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b80808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/d6a9d172f548dc4d1ff8f4918fc412c5/26b3e/Social-Security-Increasing-Improper-Payments-april.png","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/d6a9d172f548dc4d1ff8f4918fc412c5/34690/Social-Security-Increasing-Improper-Payments-april.png 399w,\n/migrantinsider/static/d6a9d172f548dc4d1ff8f4918fc412c5/bb4bc/Social-Security-Increasing-Improper-Payments-april.png 799w,\n/migrantinsider/static/d6a9d172f548dc4d1ff8f4918fc412c5/26b3e/Social-Security-Increasing-Improper-Payments-april.png 1597w","sizes":"(min-width: 1597px) 1597px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/d6a9d172f548dc4d1ff8f4918fc412c5/0b373/Social-Security-Increasing-Improper-Payments-april.webp 399w,\n/migrantinsider/static/d6a9d172f548dc4d1ff8f4918fc412c5/a8c6a/Social-Security-Increasing-Improper-Payments-april.webp 799w,\n/migrantinsider/static/d6a9d172f548dc4d1ff8f4918fc412c5/bae66/Social-Security-Increasing-Improper-Payments-april.webp 1597w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1597px) 1597px, 100vw"}]},"width":1597,"height":830}}},"excerpt":"After my Rolling Stone piece on March 13th, I received a flurry of messages asking me about how my reporting was related to an op ed in the Seattle Times.

Two weeks ago I got pulled into covering the Trump Tariff Financial Crisis at enormous length, culminating in the second interview with Paul Krugman which was released over the weekend. However, the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis has not gone away and I have quite a lot to catch up on.\n\nAfter my Rolling Stone piece on March 13th, I received a flurry of messages asking me about how my reporting was related to an op ed in the Seattle Times. Many people even generously said that my Rolling Stone reporting was confirmed correct by that article. Before we get there, let’s remember a key aspect of that Rolling Stone article. The core idea was that what makes “money” money is its ability to finally settle a transaction. A monetary payment can terminate a relationship. Conversely, once you receive payment you can leave confident that you will “hold on” to your funds. In other words, “payment finality” is important to money. The core problem is that in our modern era, money is primarily accounts with banks or governments:\n\nWhen there is an “operational” possibility the government, or any key actor in the payments system, can simply debit accounts, “finality” always has a hanging thread of doubt. Under our current technological and administrative arrangements, the only protection against this possibility is a layer of laws and norms which constrain — even asphyxiate — this distressing prospect. \n\nIn other words, we socially and legally construct payment finality as “truth”. Yet the fabric of these social and legal constructions are far more fragile than most people imagine. [emphasis added]\n\nWhich brings us back to social security.\n\nThis Seattle Times op ed covered the story of Leonard Johnson who was declared dead and had his bank account debited for $5,201, did not receive his February and March social security benefits and was finding it extremely difficult to “restart” his legal life. As I said on social media at the time, the debiting of bank accounts to “reclaim” Social Security benefits is a distinct legal issue and thus does not confirm my reporting in Rolling Stone. I’m still working on confirming my previous reporting. However, today I wanted to dig into the legal issues around Social Security’s “Death Notice Entry”. \n\nMy interest in the process by which people are declared dead by the Social Security Administration is unfortunately quite prescient. The Daily Beast released an article late on Wednesday night entitled “DOGE’s Social Security Cuts Create Chaotic ‘Day of the Dead Living’”. The article lives up to its title by outlining that DOGE moved four million people(!!!) to the Death Master File. I don’t really have the language to describe how insane this is. That is more than 1% of the United States’ population. If all those people are social security beneficiaries that would amount to just under 5.6% of social security beneficiaries. This is beyond the previous reporting that DOGE had moved 3600 immigrants with social security numbers to the death master file to pressure them to “self deport”.\n\nSimply assuming that the second Trump administration and DOGE will do the most damaging and destructive thing possible with operational control of any system and investigating accordingly has been a surreally good guide to investigating its actions. Which brings me to the core of today’s piece\n\nSubscribe\n\nOne advantage of how long I’ve taken to write this article is that I’ve had the time to commission another legal memo and get the final results back. Entitled simply “Notes on the Crises Legal Research Memorandum No. 2”, this memo is on “Automated Clearing House (ACH) System Reclamation of Social Security Benefits”. The anonymous lawyer who wrote this memo did a wonderful job. \n\nThe memo unfortunately confirmed my supposition from the first time I read the Seattle Times reporting: social security benefits have a glaring weakness in their “payment finality”. That is, when someone is declared dead by social security, their social security benefits can be “reclaimed” without any due process.  If the Social Security Administration first “learns” (or “decides”) that a beneficiary is dead they send a “death notice entry” through the Automated Clearing House’s various COBOL systems. Specifically a “death notice entry” is sent to Federal Reserve Banks who are supposed to send them onto banks in their district. This “death notice entry” is “technically” (or more precisely, “operationally”) a “zero dollar” payment with a series of “memo entries” with important information for the various payment intermediaries involved.\n\nSocial Security will follow up a “death notice” with a “Notice of Reclamation” (NOR) which “initiates the process” where the “dead” social security beneficiaries' bank will ultimately “send back” any social security benefits that were paid after the reported “death date” and to not process future social security benefits. When a bank agrees to receive a recurring payment from the Federal Government on behalf of a customer, it also agrees that its account at a Federal Reserve Bank can be debited at any time. Specifically, that its account can be debited in connection to its liability under the administrative rule making which governs ACH payments (see both Notes on the Crises Legal Research Memoranda). In simple terms, agreeing to accept social security benefits for, say, Leonard Johnson entails a bank agreeing to have their account debited for social security benefits the Social Security Administration claims were delivered after Johnson’s death. If they don’t successfully debit those amounts from Johnson’s account, that means taking a financial loss.\n\nSubscribe\n\nBecause of this liability imposed on banks, they tend to be very overzealous when it comes to sending payments back to the government. When banks receive information that a customer is dead, they will regularly send social security benefits back without even receiving a “Notice of Reclamation”. They sometimes do this when they independently find out someone is dead and Social Security has not even sent a “Death Notice Entry”. The legal memo I commissioned specifically says that the “greenbook”- the Bureau of Fiscal Service’s guide to payment processing for banks, agencies and other entities- “cautions that BFS does not authorize or direct RDFIs [Social Security Beneficiaries banks] to debit or otherwise affect the accounts of a recipient in order to return funds that have already been credited to a recipient’s account.” Nevertheless, they do so regularly.\n\nThis process by which liabilities are imposed on banks which leads them to deny payment services, as well as freeze and clawback funds, to customers is very familiar to many of the most marginalized in our society. This is a very different context where the term “derisking” is used. Undocumented immigrants have had their accounts randomly closed and the funds frozen or taken. So have sex workers, who have experienced worsening access to payments as laws targeting them- in the guise of “protecting” them- make them more and more vulnerable to having their funds seized. These laws also made it a lot more difficult to get paid, which means more danger and more risk. Indeed, the most sophisticated conversations I’ve had over the difficult-to-grasp concept of payment finality have been with sex workers who experience what I’m talking about as a daily reality. The sex worker rights movement has more than earned an “I told you so” moment; Their warnings that what could be done to them could be done to any of us are unfortunately quite prescient.\n\nThe problem of a lack of payment finality for social security benefits, specifically related to death notices, has been long running. It, however, was manageable because people could contact Social Security and have it fixed. They could go to their local social security office and present their identity documents and get this reversed. In other words, having a functioning bureaucracy helped limit the threat of a lack of payment finality which social security beneficiaries always operate under whether they knew it or not. Enter Musk and DOGE. Since Elon Musk and his apparatchiks do not understand how the Social Security Administration- or really any other agency- functions they think cutting staff is costless. Its “efficiency”. But it is not efficient. They are destroying bureaucratic efficiency and as a result social security is absolutely overloaded with people calling to try to get problems fixed. \n\nThis all brings us back to a theme we’ve come back to over and over in this newsletter: improper payments. The putative reason for impoundment and for all of DOGE’s actions, especially at the Bureau of Fiscal Service, is improper payments. This works rhetorically by conflating payments they dislike with fraud and then conflating improper payments with fraud. It also works by ignoring that underpayment is a form of improper payment. 7.9 Billion dollars of improper payments in the 2024 fiscal year were underpayments according to the GAO. \n\nThis is why I say that Elon Musk and DOGE’s plan is to explode the number and severity of improper payments. Take “just” social security. Every missed payment is an improper payment. Really, these account debits “reclaiming” social security benefits from people who are alive should count as improper payments too. Every additional month someone does not receive a social security payment is another improper payment. It’s also a worse improper payment. Getting social security benefits “reclaimed” obviously sucks regardless, but if you can get this reversed in a week that is obviously far better than trying to survive without social security benefits- and with your account having been drained- for months and months on end.\n\nIn a fundamental sense, the lack of a functioning Social Security bureaucracy makes “social security dollars” less valuable and more insecure property. Even those still receiving social security benefits have a less valuable benefit that they have to be worried could get snatched away from them for any number of reasons and they would have extremely limited recourse. They aren’t “saving money”, they are capriciously worsening social security- a program that impacts tens of millions of people- and delivering far less to ordinary Americans. It's not “more for less” or the “same for less”, it's “less and worse for barely less”. This is all without considering that ultimately this will cost a lot more to resolve and fix than simply not breaking these systems would. \n\nThinking about this alongside the extremely ominous threat covered in Wired that they have plans to “attempt” to move social security off “COBOL” in just a few months is extremely disconcerting. Especially given their reported intention to “use AI” to do it. To say the least, such a change would catastrophically explode the number and severity of improper underpayments from social security. But that is a catastrophe for another time.","html":"<div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Over the past month I needed a break to deal with organizational issues, including getting the <strong>Notes on the Crises Manhattan office(!) set up</strong> and needed time to continue a number of investigations.

Even those still receiving social security benefits have a less valuable benefit that they have to be worried could get snatched away from them for any number of reasons and they would have extremely limited recourse. They aren’t “saving money”, they are capriciously worsening social security- a program that impacts tens of millions of people- and delivering far less to ordinary Americans. It's not “more for less” or the “same for less”, it's “less and worse for barely less”. This is all without considering that ultimately this will cost a lot more to resolve and fix than simply not breaking these systems would.&nbsp;</p><p>Thinking about this alongside the extremely ominous threat <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-rebuild-social-security-administration-cobol-benefits/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>covered in Wired</u></a> that they have plans to “attempt” to move social security <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>off “COBOL”</u></a> in just a few months is extremely disconcerting.

I’ve edited it lightly based on their feedback but didn’t change anything substantive. I should also mention that I briefly lay out some proposals for changing monetary policy. Those proposals are discussed at far greater length in my full length monetary policy report that was published in January 2022. \n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\nEconomics is a discipline filled with false dichotomies. One of its most ideologically powerful is the distinction between “independent” and “democratic” central banking. \n\nAccording to most economists, independent central banking is superior to democratic central banking for two reasons. First, managing the macroeconomy requires “freedom of action” to quickly respond to changing events. Second, “politicians” (as well as the general public) prefer policy that is “too loose”. (Most often, it’s claimed that this “looseness” will cause “ruinous inflation”.) \n\nBut the first concern is hardly uncommon. As Yale law professor and economist Yair Listokin has said, “To lawyers, this is a familiar argument for delegating tasks to an expert agency [best] charted by administrative law scholars who have been wrestling with the issue for decades”. Yet it hasn’t occurred to economists to lean on administrative law in confronting these questions (or learn from that field’s specialists). Indeed, economists are mostly unaware that they are wrestling with questions of administrative law.  Administrative legal scholars, for their part, have mostly ignored the core issues of central banking though — as Professor Listokin’s scholarship attests — this is slowly changing.\n\nMeanwhile, cloaked in the language of efficiency and optimality, the second argument is a radical anti-democratic claim. This becomes clear when we conceptually separate it from the former claim. The case for insulating central banks from the preferences of politicians or the general public doesn’t rely on the delays between deliberation and action that consulting the public or lawmakers would require. Instead, the proponents of “central bank independence” are claiming that central bank policy which reflects the public’s preferences would be too economically expansionary. And that this is an overriding risk — regardless of how flexibly or speedily that policy was implemented. Academics in other social sciences, and the public at large, rightly balk at this argument.\n\nReaching to reclaim and rehabilitate democracy, many decide to defend the position economists posit as the “opposite” of independent central banking. Where economists would have “faceless bureaucrats”, these “populist” thinkers defend legislatures and presidents (or prime ministers) determining monetary policy directly. Rarely do the arguments for these simple schemas of “democratic monetary policy” confront the complexity of timing and tools that monetary policy entails.\n\nWhile in some respects attractive, the self-styled populist perspective is a trap. By accepting the premise that monetary policy is only democratic if interest rates and credit policy decisions are directly set by legislatures or heads of state, outside critics help reinforce the choice of economists to conflate anti-democratic preferences, with issues of administrative action, and careful deliberation. In the post-Trump world, it is easy to casually dismiss such suggestions as dangerous and defend central bank independence as a kind of “lesser evil” to those who are not deeply invested in the issue. Professor Skinner’s beginning submission to this roundtable is a strong recounting of this “lesser evil” case.\n\nWe do not have to accept this dichotomy. Rejecting central bank independence doesn’t have to mean rejecting administrative discretion, or some degree of independence from short-term political considerations heads of states and legislatures face. Conversely, arguing for “democratizing” central banking doesn’t necessarily mean more legislative or executive determination of the day to day — or even year to year — decisions. Once we learn to ignore this false dichotomy, we can start to imagine a variety of administrative structures which provide ordinary people the ability to provide meaningful input into these decisions.\n\nFollowing this line of thought quickly returns us to the issue of administrative law. These questions are dealt with quite routinely by administrative lawyers. They really aren’t as special or unique as economists seem to believe. Anyone who paid attention during the disastrous response to Coronavirus in the United States can appreciate the need for independence from short term political considerations. At the same time, the manifold failures of public health officials themselves also suggest that greater accountability to the public — including institutionally unsupported academics — is necessary to produce better policy. Democratizing central banking while preserving the capacity of central bankers to respond quickly and effectively to the state of the economy (as well as to crises) means recognizing that central banks are “just another administrative agency”.\n\nRecognizing that central banks are no different from other administrative agencies simplifies the question of democracy considerably. There are various models for democratizing administrative agencies — “local councils” and “citizen oversight juries” to name a few — and more generally a wide literature on balancing the need for expertise with the need for democratic accountability. There are also various methods to balance the need for coordination with other parts of government and the need to be able to act independently during intergovernmental conflict. It’s beyond the scope of this article to assess various different proposals (let alone propose my own comprehensive framework.) It is also unnecessary. By merely establishing that these issues are one and the same across the administrative state, a whole new pathway for scholarship emerges. We can finally break down the claustrophobic narrowness of the literature on central bank independence. Joining ongoing debates over administrative discretion and accountability will help us elucidate the genuinely unique economic aspects of central banking.\n\nSubscribe\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of treating central banks as just another administrative agency is it allows us to experiment with various different economic policy arrangements. The ideology of central bank independence encourages other administrative agencies to not develop macroeconomic competence, while the clear inadequacies of conventional central bank tools lead to extreme proposals where more and more economic policy powers are handed off to central banks. When we treat each federal agency as potentially an important macroeconomic actor, it follows that we must put greater value on coordinating economic policy, not just across branches of government, but within the administrative state itself. Rather than seeing coordinating entities like the Financial Stability Oversight Council as anomalies, we should see them as the norm. (Albeit future efforts should feature more dispersed decision-making authority, and more insulation from presidential pressure). \n\nThe Coronavirus Depression has itself showcased the potentially large benefits from relying on other economic policy tools. Expanding unemployment insurance benefits is a powerful tool for economic stabilization, and protection. Direct payments to individuals is popular and can operate quickly, if administratively regularized. Grants to state and local governments are also powerful and avoid painful cuts. All of these provided income to the economy without needing interest rate “room” or relying on burdening fragile non-federal balance sheets with even more debt.\n\nThe Coronavirus Depression has also showcased the large costs of not taking other administrative agencies seriously as economic policymakers. Our payments system is creaky and out of date, making it more difficult to get money quickly into every resident's hands. The reliance of unemployment benefits on state administration has run headfirst into political polarization at the local level and made the distribution of unemployment benefits uneven and erratic. Meanwhile we expected small agencies like the Small Business Administration to administer large programs, in partnership with notoriously discriminatory banks. Worse, by assuming that central bank independence has solved the problem of partisan conflict and fleeting political interests, policymakers have been mostly bereft of the infrastructure needed to avoid these issues in fiscal policy. Automatic and trigger-based administrative agency policies only saw mainstream development right as the Coronavirus crisis emerged. This timing meant there was no time to implement them before the crisis hit.\n\nWith much stronger automatic and trigger-based fiscal policies, the need for a large degree of fiscal or monetary policy discretion is reduced. There is also no need for monetary policy discretion to take the form of interest rate adjustments. As professor Eric Monnet deftly shows, monetary policy has historically included a breathtaking variety of financial regulatory policies. While I won’t lay out a detailed alternative architecture for administrative agency economic policy here — this is a short article, not a book! —  I will bring up a few suggestive modifications. \n\nDirect quantitative and qualitative financial regulation could be the main tool of monetary policy — even if it was decided on by an inter-agency council. Further, it could mainly be used as a contractionary tool, to stabilize the economy on the “upside” while fiscal policy of all types — legislative and administrative discretion along with trigger-based and automatic — responds to recessions. Interest rates on all government liabilities could be fixed to zero — or some other low number — while the central bank would adopt responsibility for issuing government securities. The treasury could finance government payments through coinage or some other tax receivable and/or legal tender instrument. Meanwhile central bank issued securities would drain the banking system of settlement balances when desirable.\n\nWhile this might not be consistent with central bank independence as conventionally defined, central banks under this proposal would still retain quite a large degree of discretion. One could even argue that — on the plain of purchase and sale policy — central banks under this proposal have greater discretion. This is because they are the sole issuers of government securities, and they alone determine how many are outstanding — and of what maturity. More importantly, fiscal policy would regain its “independence” from monetary policy and no longer have to fret over contractionary monetary policy increasing interest payments to the private sector. The myth of an all powerful independent central bank wouldn’t survive such reforms. But this framework doesn’t fit the opposite caricature of a strongman president controlling all economic policy by himself either. \n\nThere are also a number of reasons to think this sort of apparatus would produce much better economic and social outcomes. Given that the rise and dominance of central bank independence has coincided with decades of weak monetary wage growth, exploding inequality and chronic elevated unemployment, it is almost certainly the case that this kind of policy framework would lead to stronger monetary wage growth, lower inequality (especially with high top marginal tax rates), and less unemployment. For the full effect this might also require taking non-financial regulation more seriously as macroeconomic tools. Even when administrative agencies struggled to coordinate, the limitations on their discretion along with powerful automatic and trigger-based policies would prevent the consistently and overly contractionary policy we’ve seen.\n\nOf course, critics of abridging or dismissing central bank independence quickly skip past issues of unemployment, climate change, and racial or economic inequality. To them, the real question is whether demand-driven accelerations in inflation will be avoided by any new proposed architecture. Proposals stand or fall on this test, in the “anti-democratic” view. There is no way to completely dismiss this possibility. Testing the limits of our economic capacity certainly risks inflation more than our typical policy — keeping the economy in a perpetual state of “semi-slump”. Reasonable people can disagree about what counts as a “semi-boom”. A fiscal policy body could conflict with a central bank over the state of the macroeconomy, and act at cross-purposes. \n\nSubscribe\n\nYet, I’d argue this hypothetical policy conflict is worth the risk in the face of the clear reality of multiple decades where demand was inadequate and there was no other administrative agency able to — or directed to — respond. Further, this kind of agency conflict might lead to undesirably high levels of demand at particular turning points in the business cycle. But there is no reason to think that such a conflict would lead to accelerating inflation. Powell’s Federal Reserve is right to wait until it sees the “whites of inflation’s eyes”. There’s no reason to think a fiscal agency — with more limited discretion than the current Federal Reserve — would act differently. A more democratized economic policy might also be able to recognize more clearly when price increases are the result of undesirable forms of market governance rather than the inevitable effects of enhanced demand. \n\nObviously much of what I’m discussing would require legislation to enact. It would also need to avoid being struck down by courts to succeed. Democratizing the administrative state can’t make much progress while these undemocratic institutions dominate policymaking. It is notable that defenders of central bank independence in the United States typically argue from the premise that the U.S. is overall democratic...But the important institutions — such as money — must be insulated from “democratic pressure”. \n\nBut this isn’t the only way to look at things. If instead you see our anti-democratic monetary policy — what historian David Stein calls “Jim Crow monetary policy” — as a product of, well, Jim Crow another view presents itself. It then becomes plausible that democracy is the solution rather than the problem. Democratic deliberation within the administrative state can be consistent with quick and flexible policymaking. Indeed, initiatives to give the Federal Reserve a taste of democratic deliberation (such as Fed Up!) have inarguably improved Federal Reserve policy. It’s time defenders of central bank independence got off the mast.","html":"<p><strong>The extensive “Notes on the Crises Investigative Journalism Source Wish List” </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/notes-on-the-crises-investigative-journalism-source-wish-list/\"><strong><u>can be found here</u></strong></a><strong>.

By accepting the premise that monetary policy is only democratic if interest rates and credit policy decisions are directly set by legislatures or heads of state, outside critics help reinforce the choice of economists to conflate anti-democratic preferences, with issues of administrative action, and careful deliberation. In the post-Trump world, it is easy to casually dismiss such suggestions as dangerous and defend central bank independence as a kind of “lesser evil” to those who are not deeply invested in the issue. <a href=\"https://justmoney.org/c-skinner-independence-executive-pressure-and-central-bank-activism/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Professor Skinner’s beginning submission to this roundtable</u></a> is a strong recounting of this “lesser evil” case.</p><p>We <strong>do not have to accept this dichotomy.</strong> Rejecting central bank independence doesn’t have to mean rejecting administrative discretion, or some degree of independence from short-term political considerations heads of states and legislatures face. Conversely, arguing for “democratizing” central banking doesn’t necessarily mean more legislative or executive determination of the day to day — or even year to year — decisions. Once we learn to ignore this false dichotomy, we can start to imagine a variety of administrative structures which provide ordinary people the ability to provide meaningful input into these decisions.</p><p>Following this line of thought quickly returns us to the issue of administrative law. These questions are dealt with quite routinely by administrative lawyers. They really aren’t as special or unique as economists seem to believe. Anyone who paid attention during the disastrous response to Coronavirus in the United States can appreciate the need for independence from short term political considerations. At the same time, the manifold <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>failures of public health officials</u></a> themselves also suggest that greater accountability to the public —<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-teeny-tiny-scientific-screwup-that-helped-covid-kill/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> including institutionally unsupported academics</u></a> — is necessary to produce better policy. Democratizing central banking while preserving the capacity of central bankers to respond quickly and effectively to the state of the economy (as well as to crises) means recognizing that central banks are “just another administrative agency”.</p><p>Recognizing that central banks are no different from other administrative agencies simplifies the question of democracy considerably. There are various models for democratizing administrative agencies — <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00483.x?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“local councils”</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/give-political-power-to-ordinary-people-sortition?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“citizen oversight juries”</u></a> to name a few — and more generally a wide literature on balancing the need for expertise with the need for democratic accountability. There are also various methods to balance the need for coordination with other parts of government and the need to be able to act independently during intergovernmental conflict. It’s beyond the scope of this article to assess various different proposals (let alone propose my own comprehensive framework.) It is also unnecessary. By merely establishing that these issues are one and the same across the administrative state, a whole new pathway for scholarship emerges. We can finally break down the claustrophobic narrowness of the literature on central bank independence. Joining ongoing debates over administrative discretion and accountability will help us elucidate the genuinely unique economic aspects of central banking.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>One of the biggest benefits of treating central banks as just another administrative agency is it allows us to experiment with various different economic policy arrangements. The ideology of central bank independence encourages other administrative agencies to not develop macroeconomic competence, while the clear inadequacies of conventional central bank tools lead to <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/helicopter-money-time-now?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>extreme proposals</u></a> where more and more economic policy powers are handed off to central banks. When we treat each federal agency as potentially an important macroeconomic actor, it follows that we must put greater value on coordinating economic policy, not just across branches of government, but within the administrative state itself. Rather than seeing coordinating entities like the Financial Stability Oversight Council as anomalies, we should see them as the norm. (Albeit future efforts should feature more dispersed decision-making authority, and more insulation from presidential pressure).&nbsp;</p><p>The Coronavirus Depression has itself showcased the potentially large benefits from relying on other economic policy tools. Expanding unemployment insurance benefits is a powerful tool for economic stabilization, and protection. Direct payments to individuals is popular and can operate quickly, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ES_THP_Sahm_web_20190506.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>if administratively regularized</u></a>. Grants to state and local governments are also powerful and avoid painful cuts. All of these provided income to the economy without needing interest rate “room” or relying on burdening fragile non-federal balance sheets with even more debt.</p><p>The Coronavirus Depression has also showcased the large costs of not taking other administrative agencies seriously as economic policymakers. Our payments system is creaky and out of date, making it more difficult to get money <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rohangrey/status/1241382797991972864?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>quickly into every resident's hands</u></a>. The reliance of unemployment benefits <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/can-the-aspen-institutes-elite-economists/\"><u>on state administration</u></a> has run headfirst into political polarization at the local level and made the distribution of unemployment benefits uneven and erratic. Meanwhile we expected small agencies like the Small Business Administration to administer large programs, in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-dont-we-just-provide-an-emergency/\"><u>notoriously discriminatory banks</u></a>. Worse, by assuming that central bank independence has solved the problem of partisan conflict and fleeting political interests, policymakers have been <strong>mostly bereft of the infrastructure needed to avoid these issues in fiscal policy.</strong> Automatic and <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/04/20/we-need-to-let-economic-data-guide-further-economic-policy-responses-to-covid-19/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>trigger-based administrative agency</u></a> policies only saw mainstream development right as the Coronavirus crisis emerged. This timing meant there was no time to implement them before the crisis hit.</p><p>With much stronger automatic and trigger-based fiscal policies, the need for a large degree of fiscal or monetary policy discretion is reduced. There is also<strong> no need for monetary policy discretion to take the form of interest rate adjustments.</strong> As professor Eric Monnet <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/controlling-credit/DBC22208B3268FBC00AB4135D7EDD37C?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>deftly shows</u></a>, monetary policy has historically included a breathtaking variety of financial regulatory policies. While I won’t lay out a detailed alternative architecture for administrative agency economic policy here — this is a short article, not a book! —&nbsp; I will bring up a few suggestive modifications.&nbsp;</p><p>Direct quantitative and qualitative financial regulation could be the main tool of monetary policy — even if it was decided on by an inter-agency council. Further, it could mainly be used as a contractionary tool, to stabilize the economy on the “upside” while fiscal policy of all types — legislative and administrative discretion along with trigger-based and automatic — responds to recessions. Interest rates on all government liabilities could be fixed to zero — or some other low number — while the central bank would adopt <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/we-should-authorize-the-federal-reserve/\"><u>responsibility for issuing government securities</u></a>. The treasury could finance government payments <a href=\"https://rohangrey.net/files/coinage.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>through coinage or some other tax receivable and/or legal tender instrument</u></a>. Meanwhile central bank issued securities would drain the banking system of settlement balances <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/podcasts/02182019/peter-stella-debt-safe-assets-and-central-bank-operations?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>when desirable</u></a>.</p><p>While this might not be consistent with central bank independence as conventionally defined, central banks under this proposal would still retain quite a large degree of discretion. One could even argue that — <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/purchase-and-sale-policy-monetarypolicy101/\"><u>on the plain of purchase and sale policy</u></a> — central banks under this proposal have greater discretion. This is because they are the sole issuers of government securities, and they alone determine how many are outstanding — and of what maturity. More importantly, fiscal policy would regain its “independence” from monetary policy and no longer have to fret over contractionary monetary policy increasing interest payments to the private sector. <strong>The myth of an all powerful independent central bank wouldn’t survive such reforms.</strong> But this framework doesn’t fit the opposite caricature of a strongman president controlling all economic policy by himself either.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also a number of reasons to think this sort of apparatus would produce much better economic and social outcomes. Given that the rise and dominance of central bank independence has coincided with decades of weak monetary wage growth, exploding inequality and chronic elevated unemployment, it is almost certainly the case that this kind of policy framework would lead to stronger monetary wage growth, lower inequality (especially with high top marginal tax rates), and less unemployment. For the full effect this might also require taking non-financial regulation more seriously as macroeconomic tools. Even when administrative agencies struggled to coordinate, the limitations on their discretion along with powerful automatic and trigger-based policies would prevent the consistently and overly contractionary policy we’ve seen.</p><p>Of course, critics of abridging or dismissing central bank independence quickly skip past issues of unemployment, climate change, and racial or economic inequality. To them, the real question is whether demand-driven accelerations in inflation will be avoided by any new proposed architecture. Proposals stand or fall on this test, in the “anti-democratic” view. There is no way to completely dismiss this possibility. Testing the limits of our economic capacity certainly risks inflation more than our typical policy — keeping the economy in a perpetual state of <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch22.htm?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“semi-slump”</u></a>. Reasonable people can disagree about what counts as a <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch22.htm?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“semi-boom”</u></a>. A fiscal policy body could conflict with a central bank over the state of the macroeconomy, and act at cross-purposes.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Yet, I’d argue this hypothetical policy conflict is worth the risk in the face of the clear reality of multiple decades where demand was inadequate and there was no other administrative agency able to — or directed to — respond. Further, this kind of agency conflict might lead to undesirably high levels of demand at particular turning points in the business cycle. But there is no reason to think that such a conflict would lead to accelerating inflation. Powell’s Federal Reserve is right to wait until it sees the <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-fed-will-wait-thats-a-positive-for-stocks-and-a-departure-from-the-past-51616022872?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“whites of inflation’s eyes”</u></a>. There’s no reason to think a fiscal agency — with more limited discretion than the current Federal Reserve — would act differently. A more democratized economic policy might also be able to recognize more clearly when price increases are the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/competition-law-as-collective-bargaining-law-published-paper-preview/\"><u>result of undesirable forms of market governance</u></a> rather than the inevitable effects of enhanced demand.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously much of what I’m discussing would require legislation to enact. It would also need to avoid being struck down by courts to succeed. Democratizing the administrative state can’t make much progress while these undemocratic institutions dominate policymaking. It is notable that defenders of central bank independence in the United States typically argue from the premise that the U.S. is overall democratic...But the important institutions — such as money — must be insulated from “democratic pressure”.&nbsp;</p><p>But this isn’t the only way to look at things. If instead you see our anti-democratic monetary policy — what historian <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/41288148/_Containing_Keynesianism_in_an_Age_of_Civil_Rights_Jim_Crow_Monetary_Policy_and_the_Struggle_for_Guaranteed_Jobs_1956_1979_?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>David Stein calls “Jim Crow monetary policy”</u></a> — as a product of, well, Jim Crow another view presents itself. It then becomes plausible that democracy is the solution rather than <strong>the problem</strong>. Democratic deliberation within the administrative state can be consistent with quick and flexible policymaking. Indeed, initiatives to give the Federal Reserve a taste of democratic deliberation (such as <a href=\"https://www.populardemocracy.org/campaign/building-national-campaign-strong-economy-fed?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Fed Up!</u></a>) have inarguably improved Federal Reserve policy.

seven weeks since the first interview Krugman did with me was published, I have another interview to bring readers. It's quite surreal to be something like a regular correspondent for Paul Krugman on what’s happening. Even more so because this interview is not particularly focused on, say, the Treasury’s internal payments system or the technicalities of the Automated Clearing House payments system. Instead it's focused on the bread and butter elements that make up a modern financial crisis. \n\nOne reason this is surreal for me is that I first got interested in economics when, in January 2009, I took a class called “Show Me the Money” at Urban Academy Laboratory High School that was all about the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 that had just happened. Krugman’s articles were a regular feature in that class. I don’t think I could have imagined then that sixteen years later Paul Krugman would be regularly inviting me onto his “show” to explain what’s going on- including with a burgeoning financial crisis. Life truly takes you to strange places.\n\nSpeaking of strange surreal experiences, it's time to tell readers other exciting news: I’ve signed a lease for a Notes on the Crises office in Manhattan! It is unbelievable that the generous support of readers has gotten me to this point, but it has. My vision for this office- in its entire 2000 square feet glory- will be explained in detail in the coming weeks and months. For now I’ll just say that this office will allow me to greatly expand my activities and facilitate creating a community of interested experts, researchers, freelancers, and volunteers- and with enough funding and support, perhaps even employees…- to do more reporting on a greater number of topics. It also facilitates me building a professional audio/video set up so that Notes on the Crises does not simply live in the written word. Furnishing the office is moving quickly and the office should be functional, and open to interested parties, by the end of next week. For security reasons I am keeping the location of the office confidential- events with subscribers will happen elsewhere.\n\nFinally, I’d like to end with what I said in the introduction of the previous Krugman interview:\n\nIf you want to take on Krugman’s concern about what happens “if you get hit by a truck” and my answer “If someone out there who's watching this or reading the transcript wants to put up a budget, $500,000 or a million to train up people and, you know, make me replaceable, I'm more than eager to train up my redundancies.”  You are more than welcome to email me at Crisesnotes@gmail.com or contact me on signal at NathanTankus.01\n\nYoutube video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfymwafbYrk\n\n\n\nPaul Krugman’s Introduction:\n\nNathan Tankus has become an essential resource during these strange and scary times. My last chat with Nathan was about DOGE’s depredations at government agencies. This time I spoke with him about disruptions in financial markets.\n\nI continue to be astonished at how important the “plumbing” of these markets — the stuff that makes them function, which we normally don’t even notice — becomes when everything falls apart. And economists in general don’t know that much about the plumbing, so we need help from people like Nathan who do.\n\nOne thing that struck me during the conversation was Nathan’s explanation of the partial easing of financial stress after the crazy tariffs announced April 2 were replaced by the equally crazy tariffs of April 9. He points out that while a serious analysis of the April 9 tariffs showed that they were as bad in their own way as the original tariffs, the narrative was that policy had eased. And markets, he insists (and I agree) are less information processors than conventional wisdom processors.\n\nMuch more in the interview. Transcript below.\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT: \n\n[recorded 4/16/25]\n\nPaul Krugman: So hi. Paul Krugman again.\n\nI'm doing a second session with Nathan Tankus, who is everywhere these days.\n\nHe's really in the middle of it. And last time we spoke it was really about DOGE which has by no means gone away as an issue but we're also having crazy action in the financial markets, which is in some ways, Nathan, where you came into this whole discussion. I want to try and actually figure it out myself, but also walk listeners through what's going on.\n\nSo welcome. I guess this is my show these days.\n\nYou were actually warning about a potential financial crisis before the whole post Rose Garden stuff. You want to tell us about what you were thinking and we can go from there?\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah. So, I've been calling this series since it started January 31st, the “Trump-Musk payments crisis.” And so this is a lot of what we talked about last time, All of the different ways that this system could blow up. We really emphasized that what the DOGE people are messing with at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service is literally the ability to make treasury payments. And in fact, what they're doing is so catastrophic that making treasury payments is kind of the least of the concerns. That'll be the most immediate thing, but like, you know, not getting money in the hospitals, not being able to collect taxes… \n\nIt’s hard to wrap your mind around this because it's so big, it’s kind of beyond a fiscal heart attack. Just, like, making the fiscal machinery of government completely break down. And they\n\nclearly have not really understood that they've been messing with that.\n\nAnd then an added layer, which I started covering around mid-March and had been investigating for a few weeks is that they took $80 million from New York City  or they debited New York City's account for $80 million. That kind of might sound complicated, but it's just like any time that you make a credit card payment, you're authorizing your credit card company to debit your account, so you make the payment. All sorts of other debits or credits are authorized by all sorts of actors, but sometimes these debits aren't authorized. Sometimes they're just done without warning.\n\nAnd normally what happens is, if you do that kind of thing, it's considered fraud and you get frozen out of the payment system if you do it too much. But in this case, because it's the federal government, there's no actor to freeze the federal government out of the payment system once there's a question.\n\nIn some fundamental sense, the whole concept of money is making a payment, and then that payment is done. That debt is canceled. You've figured it out. Maybe there's some legal dispute that comes up, and they decide to sue you after. But that's a whole new legal environment. There's no taking it back without going through any legal process unless you're the federal government. And from all the experts I've talked to and some anonymous sources, it seems like  there's no guardrail on their ability to just take money out of anyone's account.\n\nThat's messing fundamentally with the concept of money. When money is physical cash and I can hand you some dollar bills and then you can walk away, the idea that the payment is final is kind of easier. I have to go track you down, chase you down, have a court case to find you and send some people out there. But with accounts, there's always that awkward question of, can I just take the money back in your account? And we have all sorts of legal and operational niceties that makes that concept go further and further from your mind.\n\nObviously, there are people who experience these kinds of things already: immigrants before the recent crisis, sex workers, you know, there are all sorts of people at the margins of the\n\nfinancial system who know about how kind of shaky payment finality can be, but it's not a\n\ngeneralized thing in the whole society. It's not, for example, taking money out of New York City's bank account.\n\nAnd so, connecting it back to the financial crisis is, if you start recognizing that the United States government is undermining the concept that a payment is a payment is a payment and that there's payment finality and that you have the idea that at any moment your bank account can be frozen, debited, anything else, and that you can't really trust having money in the bank,\n\neven if it's to deposit insured because the Trump administration is taking the prerogative that they can just take anything from you. If financial markets took this seriously, this would already be like a burgeoning financial crisis.\n\nPaul Krugman: In some ways, I feel like we should be spending all our time on that. But on top of that, we have what looks to me to be a pretty big market dislocation. Nevermind the stock market though I think we both agree that that's not the right barometer but we're looking at bond markets, currency markets and while stuff has been happening and I thought I was ready after 2008 for weird stuff to happen in markets, but now we're getting a whole new level of weird and I've been reading you to try and understand.\n\nSo maybe first, just your initial take on what's been happening since Trump held up\n\nhis piece of cardboard in the Rose Garden.\n\nNathan Tankus: So we could talk about all sorts of complicated details. And of course, I've written literally 16,000 words on all the complicated details since last week. But in the big picture, the details are just to solidify the basic above the fold take, which is:  this is an extraordinary financial crisis because it is a financial crisis, more than any other financial crisis ever, that is directly connected to the erratic and bizarre and dangerous behavior of one person.\n\nAnd it's not simply the things that he's doing, but the sort of erratic moment to moment\n\ndecision making. In certain ways, if Trump just committed to causing a depression, if he just committed like, “we're gonna do these tariffs,” and he could credibly commit, to “we're going to cause a depression,” it would, of course, have all sorts of knock-on effects, but we wouldn't have had the financial crisis that we essentially had that, despite a lull, I think we're still in the middle of, because the financial crisis was specifically about the erratic-ness of his decisions.\n\nFor younger people on the internet, there's a kind of joke, like, “it's so over. We're so back.”\n\n“It's so over. We're so back,” which is just the idea where something bad happens and then you're like, “everything's done.” And then something good happens. You're like, “we're so back.\n\nEverything's great.” You know, “we're on top of the world.” And essentially the stock market has been behaving on a “it's so over, we're so back” mindset of just, “Trump is going to crash everything. No wait, the business people are in charge and actually things are going to be okay.”\n\nAnd they have been trading on that news in this frantic way, moment to moment, where even like a fake headline about Trump backing off on tariffs can, within 15 minutes. create and then take back $2.5 trillion of value on the stock market. And so that's the top line thing: this is a crisis of just Trump's erraticness and Wall Street perceives Trump as somewhat less erratic this week. So the volatility has gone down and so it's not such a crisis. So, if you can believe that Trump will stop, will not be so erratic in the future, then you might be able to believe that this financial crisis is over.\n\nPaul Krugman: And by the way, that’s not just financial, it's real. I mean, real investments, plant and equipment investments and so on. Who can make those investments when they have no idea what policy will be a week from now? But the mechanics. Normally you would expect tariffs to strengthen the dollar. Instead it's weakened. Normally we see interest rates go up, but it's been really weird. It's a spike in interest rates. Interest rates should strengthen the dollar, but it's weakened. And then there are lots of individual markets where spreads have widened a lot.\n\nWhat I learned from you is that the picture we all kind of have of this kind of smoothly\n\nfunctioning financial system is really wrong. You wrote about it, and maybe I should let you talk and try to explain, then I'll see if I can add or just reveal my confusion about all of that.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah. So the way I would put it is: Trump's erratic and bizarre behavior has kind of intersected with a set of longstanding financial regulatory and macro financial issues that a lot of experts have been talking about, at least aspects of, for the last decade. You know, a kind of conversation that was burgeoning in the circles that I run in.\n\nSo to back up, we had a great financial crisis in 2007-2008, largely associated with how the banks failed, they didn't have enough capital, and then also there were these sets of liquidity issues.\n\nAnd so there's a committee called the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is an\n\ninformal committee, but has developed a lot of informal power, which is basically a meeting of a bunch of financial regulators. The United States, Japan, Europe, coming together to come up with ways to reorganize the financial system. And they've done this a few different times. There was a time in the 80s called Basel I. There was a time in, like, the late 90s, early 2000s called Basel II. And then post financial crisis, we got Basel III.\n\nThe big thing about Basel II that a lot of people hammered on was: Basel II tried to focus things on risk-weighted capital requirements. So that's a way of talking about, okay, certain assets are a lot less risky than others, so maybe you shouldn't have to have as much net worth devoted to protecting yourself from losses for safer assets.\n\nPaul Krugman: For listeners, traditional banks take deposits, lend out the money, but we want\n\na bank to have some of its own money at stake, partly as a cushion so that if it takes losses on its lending, it can come out of the bank's capital, partly so that the bank has some skin in the game so that it doesn't take on due risks. And Basel II tried to say, the amount of capital should depend on how risky are the assets you're buying in. And they came up with a scheme for that. So that's really what you're describing.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah. So, to kind of roll that out a little bit, if a bank just got a rubber stamped bank license, like, “Hey, you want a bank license? Let's get you a bank license.” And you suddenly had the ability to create money and access the Fed, you make a bunch of loans and then you have assets and you have deposits. And the issue is: if you take any loss whatsoever, then your net worth, your equity (basically just assets minus liabilities) is negative. And for various reasons, this idea of easily getting a bank license only to have your net worth go negative, is not something that financial regulators have ever wanted to incentivize.\n\nSo what they do is, they say to someone who's proposing a business plan for a bank, “hey,\n\nyou need to have some starting out net worth so we know as you're getting going and you're making mistakes and you take some losses, that your net worth is not going to just be negative and that you're not, essentially, just getting to piggyback on the public dime, and so you don’t have the ability to just, like, change the world by making loans without anything on your end. So what you do is, you find “investors.” You sell them stock. They get this stock and say, “this is a nice stock.” And then they pay you money and that money becomes money in your account at the Federal Reserve. Then, on an accounting basis, you're starting out with your assets worth a lot more than your liabilities. And that's great.\n\nAnd so as you start making loans and so on, then you have that cushion of net worth to take losses. And for kind of obvious reasons, you want to make sure that people don't make so many loans and so many risky loans that they collapse, but they're still able to make a certain amount of loans.\n\nA lot of people showed up and said, “well, it should depend on the riskiness.” For example, owning a treasury bill, at least traditionally, forgetting everything that's happened in the last year or the last four months, is a lot safer than making a loan to a local real estate developer. And so why should you have to have the protection of a bunch of net worth against the treasury security the same way as you would for the loan? And so that makes sense a little bit, but the problem is in the details.\n\nThe problem is, okay, what is actual risk? How do you measure risk? How do you come up with that? And it's a lot harder and it's a lot easier to game than it seems on the surface. And in particular, what Basel II said was, “We're gonna trust the bank's internal models of risk. And as long as their internal models of risk say it's okay, then it's okay.”\n\nAnd I don't think it takes very much intellectual effort to think of all the ways that that\n\ncould blow up. And there are all sorts of details about how that got messed with and how that was manipulated to let the banks take on extraordinary amounts of risk without seeming like\n\nthose risks were there. That's a whole thing on the 2007, 2008 financial crisis. Whole books have been written about that topic.\n\nBut for today’s purposes, what's important is, Basel III showed up and said, “Okay, we went a little too crazy with the risk weighting. We need to just have a sort of backstop. We need to have, especially for the largest banks, a supplementary leverage requirement. So we'll have risk weighted, but we'll make sure we'll sanity check by saying, ‘there's this size of your balance sheet relative to your net worth that you can't go beyond.’” And then at the same time, which we can get into a little bit more, there were all sorts of things that they did on the liquidity side. But that's the big picture. And we'll talk a little bit more about how this has led into the crisis.\n\nPaul Krugman: Yeah, so Basel III set kind of a floor on capital, right? And then we've been operating under that regime. And what did that do?\n\nNathan Tankus: So, these largest banks at a tactical level, at a corporate level, they're called “bank holding companies.” And what that means is, they're not just the nice little chartered bank that has an account at the Federal Reserve. They have all these other subsidiaries that engage in all sorts of different activities. These are really kind of colossal institutions. And traditionally, going way back to the ‘50s, ‘60s and such, there was a technical part of the Federal Reserve Act which reached into these companies and limited how much the bank part could support the non-bank parts.\n\nAnd there’s a really under-reported part of the 2007- 2008 financial crisis about this. Saule Omarova, who was Biden's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency nominee, who was a Cornell Law professor, now I believe at University of Pennsylvania, has a really great paper from 2011 that's all about this issue.\n\nAnd one of the under-reported parts about the financial crisis is: as the banking system was starting to experience issues essentially about making payments, about being able to finance itself, especially on the putatively non-bank part of these bank holding companies, what they started to do was give waivers to these protections to let the bank part finance everything else, to essentially let finance leak out of the bank part to the non-bank parts. And that was their way of trying to keep things on the even keel. Of course, at a certain point it got too big for this kind of maneuver, but what that meant was that post financial crisis, it was like, “okay.” When things are hard with the largest banks, they're always just gonna let liquidity go wherever. They're not gonna keep to the original mechanism of trying to keep these things separate. If we're gonna deal with this, then we need to kind of assume that liquidity can go anywhere, that funds can go anywhere within a bank holding company. And so we need regulations on the whole bank holding company.\n\nAnd so these leverage requirements are on the whole bank holding company. And their\n\nliquidity requirements, these requirements of how many essentially “high quality liquid financial assets” they need to have. And we can talk about whether they're actually high quality liquid financial assets, but regardless, they have to hold these in case they need to make payments.\n\nBasically, what this did was, it made these balance sheets quite rigid. You know, on one hand, you have banks that have what are supposed to be liquid assets, that they're unwilling to use most of the time, even during stress times, because the regulations tell them they’ve got to hold onto these supposedly liquid assets. And at the same time, their balance sheets are kind of rigid now. They can't move up and down the way that they could before, especially for things that\n\nwere supposed to be low risk. And so this brings us to the treasury market. I don't know if you want to…\n\nPaul Krugman: So, alright. I think where we're going is that with the regulations, in some sense, it's fighting the last war issue.  The regulations were designed to limit the risk of a 2008 style crisis. And as I understand it, basically the restrictions on bank holding companies forced or led other institutions to step into the breach. Is that what really is happening?\n\nNathan Tankus: Exactly. And this kind of gets to the fundamental concept of liquidity.\n\nLiquidity is the idea that: I've got an asset and I can sell it or make a payment at a certain amount, accounted for value. The obvious example is a dollar bill. A dollar bill is a dollar and I can make a payment with the dollar. I can go to my bank and deposit a dollar in my account.\n\nThat's not perfect liquidity, but pretty darn good. And same thing with money in my checking account from the perspective of me as an individual.\n\nBut there are all sorts of assets out there. There are stocks, bonds, currencies. There are all sorts of assets, and trillions and trillions of dollars of assets. And by virtue of being assets, of being out there, someone has to own them. And if you own them, you have to hold them. And one of the under-commented strengths of the previous system was that balance sheets could expand and contract a lot as you need it, specifically around treasury bonds.\n\nSo, okay, however many billions of treasuries that are being auctioned, where people\n\nwant to sell more treasuries, there's a dealer. There's a government bond dealer that is in a bank holding company saying, “we'll make money if we expand our balance sheet and buy up some treasuries. So we'll do that. And hey people, there's a lot of demand for treasuries right now. Our balance sheet can shrink as we sell off these treasuries and we pay back our\n\nliabilities.”\n\nAnd this created a kind of flexibility, this ebb and flow where treasuries were liquid because there was a balance sheet that could always absorb them when they needed to be absorbed.\n\nSomeone's balance sheet could expand and take them on. And it didn't require a whole bunch of action from the Federal Reserve because the Federal Reserve could sort of just cultivate these larger conditions. And we didn't really notice that it was really the public backstopping all these things through all these powers that we've delegated.\n\nAnd the treasury market, it being the “most liquid market in the world” and being stable in that way, was related to these bank holding company dealers whose balance sheet could expand and contract.\n\nPaul Krugman: So I just have a clarifying question. The treasury is just US federal government debt. Are you using it to mean only the short-term treasury bills or are you including the longer maturities?\n\nNathan Tankus: I'm including all of it.\n\nPaul Krugman: But basically anybody who’d want to sell federal government debt could easily do that, which we took for granted, but was actually because there were these dealers who were basically in the bank holding companies who were the residual buyers who would always step in. But that was then.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah, exactly, exactly. They were the residual buyers. But we still had to deal with this risk problem. To have an absolute constraint on the whole balance sheet, the question became who's going to be the new buyer. And we should say big banks have talked about this.\n\nLike, let's exempt treasuries from leverage requirements. And there's a whole complicated set of debates for why regulators, why good governance types have not wanted to do that. And there's questions about whether it would fully deal with the issue and there's stuff with liquidity requirements.\n\nBut putting all that aside, fundamentally, whether or not there was an easy fix on the regulation side, you still need to have a residual buyer. And what has stepped in as the residual buyer has been hedge funds, these types of investors. They find high net worth institutions like pension funds and universities, and they sell them what are called limited partner shares. And basically they're able to go to town and make investments and say, “Hey, we'll get you a good return.” And what these entities have been doing in terms of, like, picking pennies off the ground, has expanded their balance sheet by buying treasuries, and they have been hedging themselves, essentially.\n\nSo there's a kind of product that institutions can buy that is supposedly safer, especially for those long end treasuries of 30 year, or 10 year terms. And so these funds have become the residual buyer.  They have stepped into the void created by a lack of monetary design by the\n\nfederal government. So something grew up to take on this role.\n\nPaul Krugman: Okay, so until a few months ago, if you were trying to sell US government debt, it would be very easy to do, you wouldn't be disturbing the price. But what many of us didn't realize was that actually it was a hedge fund that would step in and they would expect to be able to unload it but what made the assets easier to sell was the role of the hedge funds,\n\nwhich is a little alarming because people have always worried about hedge funds and whether they might be a systemic risk. And for most of my professional life, the answer was, “well, no, not really.” But now you're saying that they're in the middle of the system.\n\nNathan Tankus  Yeah, absolutely. And so people started becoming conscious of this around September 2019. There was a little hiccup, called repo madness, but then March 2020 comes around. In March 2020, the treasury market started to [experience] dysfunction. And it was that moment where people started recognizing this. The Federal Reserve, of course, stepped in and bought trillions of dollars of treasuries. At that time, I was pointing to the fact that we were covertly supporting the treasury market in these previous instances. We were covertly doing all these things.\n\nIt's a lot more obscure when the Federal Reserve issues a waiver to a technical regulation\n\nfrom the Federal Reserve Act no one's ever heard of in 2007 than when the Federal Reserve\n\nannounces in 2020 that it's going to be buying treasuries.\n\nPaul Krugman: So, March 2020, in case people have short memories, that's when COVID\n\nstarts.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yes, exactly. So COVID was a period of intense instability, dysfunction, and dysregulation. And in that moment, hedge funds started backing away and the treasury market started to dysfunction. We can talk about why hedge funds started backing away and the kind of problems there. But what I want to emphasize here is that when the Federal Reserve did that, people said,  “My God, the interventionist Federal Reserve is borrowing trillions of dollars in securities.”\n\nBut from my point of view, they were issuing waivers so that bank holding companies could provide whatever funds that the rest of the company needed. This was as interventionist an action from the Federal Reserve to support the Treasury market or support liquidity in these other markets as it would have been for the Federal Reserve to be buying it themselves. It's just that one way is kind of covert. It's sleepy. It's obscure. It's very difficult to understand. And one's kind of direct.\n\nThe story is, the Federal Reserve bought Treasury securities, so then they're more liquid because they bought them. It's a thing that people can kind of grasp from maybe a macroeconomics 101 class whereas the kind of sleepy regulation thing is more difficult. I read a whole law review article about it from Biden's OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] nominee and that's how I know about it.\n\nPaul Krugman: Alright.  So, in March 2020 there was a freeze up in the treasuries market and because the world had become wildly uncertain because of Covid, so the federal reserve stepped in and bought treasuries.  But there was a period there when they actually were hard to sell. And basically five years later, almost to the day, we get another seize up, this time\n\nnot because of a virus, but because of Donald Trump. And what you're saying is that basically hedge funds were not able to do their normal role. I think I know how that happens, but maybe you should spell that out a bit.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah. It's kind of funny to me because, you know, we were talking about Basel II and all that stuff about the risk weighted capital requirements. Well, we kind of have this bifurcated system where we solve the problems for the previous iteration of financial regulations. You know, we solve Basel II with Basel III for banks and for bank holding companies. Or we think we've solved it.\n\nBut then it's not like these kinds of risk management practices have gone away. I mean, they're not as bad as they used to be, but fundamentally, at the basic level, it's a lot of the same stuff.\n\nThe banks in 2005, in 2006, 2007 used value-at-risk models, which is a type of model of\n\ntrying to calculate risk from historical data, especially recent historical data, to see how risky, how volatile things are, to judge how risky what they're doing is. And so what happens when volatility goes up a lot, the value-at-risk model says, “there's a lot more risk out there.”\n\nAnd then, again, they have that conversation about capital, about financial net worth. You're only supposed to be taking on a certain amount of risk for a certain amount of net worth or a “certain amount of capital”. When the risk models blow out suddenly, you're taking on way too much risk for your amount of capital and the risk models are telling you, “you've got to deleverage, you've got to sell assets, pay back debts, shrink your balance sheet.”\n\nBut remember, the whole point, the reason that the hedge funds have become important in\n\nthe first place is that their balance sheets can expand when they need to expand. And so this is now creating the classic pro-cyclical situation. Liquidity is there when you don't really feel like you need it, and when you really feel like you need it, it's not there.\n\nLev Menand, law professor at Columbia, and his colleague Josh Younger, who used to be at the New York Federal Reserve, called them shadow dealers. Shadow dealers are kind of similar to shadow money in the sense that they're providing this treasury dealer role. They're in the market to buy and sell, but only when the times are good. Normal dealers are licensed by the Federal Reserve. They are supposed to always be there in the market. They're always supposed to be bidding on auctions and the privileges that they get are supposed to come with certain responsibilities, and of course hedge funds have none of those responsibilities. \n\nPaul Krugman: So, what's happened now is that you’ve got volatility. Nobody knows what tariffs are going to be in place three days from now. And that ends up weighing on hedge funds, which feel the need to contract. I guess I would throw in that when you mentioned picking up pennies, I'm old enough to remember long-term capital management, which was a gigantic hedge fund and people always said that their business model was vacuuming up pennies from under the couch cushions on a global scale, and it was great until it wasn't, and then suddenly blew up and markets froze in 1998 when that happened. And you're saying that actually what we're looking at now is something like that happening again except now it’s the market for US treasuries that actually is freezing up.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yes. But the same sort of things are happening in all sorts of different markets that, superficially, you might not see as directly related to the initial thing. For various complicated historical reasons over the last 15 years, a system has been built up where if things get too erratic, liquidity dries up in all these different parts of the system. And there's no balance sheet that is able or willing to absorb what's going on, unless of course it's the Federal Reserve or the Federal Government's balance sheet. \n\nBut there's no private sector balance sheet that's willing to absorb the\n\nassets that are on there. And where it comes back to Donald Trump. You have a system that works unless volatility goes above a certain level, Donald Trump is the perfect thing to give a heart attack to the system because he is volatility encapsulated.\n\nPaul Krugman: Okay, so it really is these highly leveraged actors out there who are really critical. You're saying it’s a market for treasuries and presumably a lot of other stuff as well. I mean, you're seeing spreads blow out on not just junk bonds, but sort of BAA corporate bonds, that sort of thing.\n\nSo the new climate of uncertainty basically forces the hedge funds—or high leverage\n\nactors, but I guess that's basically hedge funds—to contract and sell stuff. And so you get spiking interest rates even on heretofore the safest assets in the world. For some of us, the fall on the dollar, that's different from March 2020. At that time, the dollar actually went up because America was still the safe haven. So why is the dollar now falling in the middle of all of this?\n\nNathan Tankus: So, I think there's a few different things there. Before we get to exactly where the dollar is or why the dollar is falling in this situation, what I would emphasize is that liquidity is drying up everywhere.  When I say everywhere, I mean everywhere. \n\nLiquidity in, like, essentially currency trading. The foreign exchange market also kind of seized up last week. There was an article in risk.net that said liquidity in the foreign exchange spot market was worse than during COVID. Some of these same things happened in COVID, but this happened more. And the article says that relative to the period leading up to this, volatility within a day (financial market participants use the phrase “intraday” for that) but volatility went up more than five times.\n\nAnd so that volatility explosion is really the thing that's important in the foreign exchange market. Suddenly you really need to have big, big price movements where some entity with a balance sheet decides to step in and absorb some position or another.\n\nThis also connects up to the last 15 years. These things are called foreign exchange swaps.\n\nThere's the type of derivative where you swap one currency for another, you swap yen for dollars, and then it'll go back the other way. You'll swap it at a different price at some time down the line—a week, a month, three months, whatever. And these have become the kind of focal point of the financial system.\n\nAs of June 2024, there was $113 trillion worth of foreign exchange swaps out in the world, which is a mind-numbing number. The vast majority of that had dollars on one side. 87% of those swaps involved dollars, which is a truly astounding amount. Dollars are so important to this system that generally speaking, when a Japanese bank wants euros or a European bank or a British bank wants yen, they don't just swap. The obvious thing would be to swap yen for euros.\n\nInstead, they first swap yen for dollars and then swap dollars for euros. The dollar serves even as an intermediary between Japan and Europe, it's so central in these foreign exchange markets.\n\nPaul Krugman: Yeah. We call it the vehicle currency and it's what you take to get a ride from one currency to the other. But that role depends on dealers and the dealers need liquidity. \n\nWow. Okay.\n\nSo what you're saying is that all the foreign exchange markets, presumably corporate bond markets, treasuries, all of it depends upon liquidity supplied largely by hedge funds.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yes, in our current system. But also foreign hedge funds. It's not just that domestic hedge funds have pulled back. It's also that there are foreign hedge funds. And this is where these foreign exchange swaps come in. I wrote a piece a couple of years ago called The Utopian Vision of Financial Derivatives,  and what that piece was getting at is, if you're an ordinary person you might think lending to a New York real estate developer or lending to a regional Japanese government or lending to a British oil and gas company, that these are all different things.\n\nBut if you have a certain kind of lens, if you see the world through a certain set of rose-tinted glasses, all the financial market participant sees are different kinds of risks that can be mixed and matched. And I can turn any of those assets into a kind of treasury bill. I’ve just got to buy the right derivatives. So if I'm worried about them defaulting, then I can buy a credit default swap, which is just insurance against default. If I'm worried about the interest rates moving in a way that's bad for me, I'll buy an interest rate swap.\n\nAnd so you can sort of just construct any sort of asset you want. And this works as long as you don't have to worry about actually getting paid by the other person who has your derivative. And this of course was the big thing in the 2008 financial crisis.  The insurance giant AIG took one side of all of those credit default swap bets and then couldn't pay up. And then the federal government had to step in.\n\nBut even putting aside the counterparty stuff, there's also just this basic question of liquidity. My model says that when this certain event happens, the value of this asset will go down. But the model says the derivative should go up just enough to offset it. And so I haven't actually taken any loss. But the problem is, you don't actually know what's going to be happening in the\n\nliquidity, whether the model value will line up because of things that can be going on in the world. For example, liquidity drying up everywhere. And there's no such thing as a private sector liquidity swap. And of course, even if there were, the obvious question would be: who guarantees liquidity for the liquidity swap?\n\nAnd so ultimately, what happens is, there are all these investors who make decisions based on the idea that risks are just all swappable and they can get whatever kind of portfolio that they want with these products. And then it doesn't work in crisis times.\n\nPaul Krugman: Okay, and so we get this possibility that increased volatility means that the people who supply liquidity kind of go away, which means that all of these investments that were\n\nsupposed to be safe or at least limited risk because you had derivatives start to become\n\nreally problematic. So that's what you think is happening now to the markets.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah, when volatility goes down, it gets better. But volatility is elevated if you look at things like the VIX, which is an index everyone relies on. It has gone down some. So things are kind of a little bit calmer right now, but they're still quite elevated compared to what they were before all this started. With other financial crises, there's all sorts of financial indicators that you can look at to judge whether a crisis is gonna get more severe. The issue is, because everything is just related to volatility and the volatility in this situation is just related to Trump, there's no real financial expertise that can tell you exactly where this is going. It's like, you just need a psychologist. You need someone who's somehow an expert in Trump's mind palace or the people around Trump and how they can manipulate him (or not) to judge whether\n\nvolatility is going to explode next week or whether it'll settle down and he'll just, you know, flip channels and not get so focused on the news that week.\n\nPaul Krugman: Yeah. So what's strange is that it's not even so much the level of tariffs. It’s the fact that you don't know what they're going to be. We had one radical break in the tariff regime on April 2nd and then it zipped in a completely different direction on April 9th and then another big change on April 12th. And that's what's really the problem.\n\nNathan Tankus: And that's why I said the financial system would do a lot better if Trump just committed to creating a depression. Then you'd be like, “okay, he's going to raise tariffs a lot.\n\nHe's going to stick to it. It's going to cause a global recession. But we know it's going to cause a global recession.” The volatility now has been about trying to predict what will happen. And all the back and forth. And those huge swings between “the economy will be fine” vs. “a depression is coming” is what's interacting with these extant vulnerabilities in the financial system.\n\nPaul Krugman: I would say it's not clear you would be causing a depression if the policy\n\nwere stable. If we just had 25% tariffs. And everybody knew that was stable, then that would be a bad thing, but business would work with it. And it's not known whether they're 25% or 10% or 100%. That is the problem.\n\nAll right. In 2020, the Fed just stepped in and bought lots of treasuries. Is there a simple technical fix to this one? Why doesn't Jerome Powell just step in and rescue us from all of this?\n\nNathan Tankus: Well, there's a couple things.  We're talking about it kind of happening everywhere, and it kind of did happen everywhere in 2020, which is why there were all those other facilities around corporate debt, around municipalities and so on.\n\nPaul Krugman: So these were not just treasury bonds. I didn't even know that. I'm embarrassed, but they did a bunch of facilities for other markets as well, not just buying Treasuries?\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nPaul Krugman: Okay. So, sorry, go on.\n\nNathan Tankus: And so, they can step in on the liquidity issues. They're still worried about inflation and the tariffs are bringing up the question of inflation even more. So it’s kind of a full spectrum thing. They probably wouldn't do it unless things got really, really bad. But, I would expect,  if the treasury market had gotten too chaotic for them, I think they would have\n\nstepped in. And I think ultimately, even if there’s some awkwardness between some of the\n\nthings that they had said coming into this crisis, they would do that. And it would basically be fine.\n\nThe problem is, you know, in 2007, 2008, the volatility was about financial instability and recognizing the financial instability. So stepping in to stabilize financial markets could slow down or make the volatility go away. But, you know, Jerome Powell can't make the volatility of Donald Trump go away.\n\nAnd the Fed, for various reasons, both political but also kind of practical, wouldn't want to try to do a big audacious step in to deal with all the dysfunction related to Trump being unstable. I think if you ask them at a press conference, it would be like, “Well, it's the president's response.\n\nThe president is making a certain amount of decisions and he is pursuing a certain amount of economic policy and it's not our role to countermand him. And so if he wants to create a whole bunch of instability for his own reasons, that's essentially his business and we'll be concerned and we'll look at all the markets. But, you know, we hope there's a resolution to this and yada, yada, yada.”\n\nSo, doing a whole bunch of things probably wouldn't work that well and would also be stepping into the void or getting in the middle of this very charged political set of issues. As long as the Treasury can still make payments,  they can let Trump get to a certain point and see if there's kind of a resolution to this situation. The Fed doesn’t want to be involved with this at all, or as little as it can. They would prefer there to be a political resolution. \n\nAnd you kind of see similar things at a much lesser scale around the debt ceiling crises, where they've tried to really step out of the way and see it as a political issue to be resolved and only step in if they think something is irreversibly broken or if that seems like it is about to happen.\n\nPaul Krugman: Okay, I'm not sure if this is a devil's advocate argument or not,  but is there kind of a floor on how bad things can get? Because if the Fed steps in with facilities to address these kinds of balance sheets, and all the volatility contagion, if it's bad enough, they can always make sure that there is enough liquidity. They are essentially the buyer of last resort for a lot of assets.\n\nNathan Tankus: Let me think about that. I think to a certain extent that's true, but only for short bursts.  There's just a certain level of volatility where some of these non-bank financial institutions will blow up. I really think we were close to that Wednesday. I think if he had not backed off, if he had waited another day, we easily could have had a firm or multiple firms blow up and go down. And that's why I brought up Lehman Brothers in one of my posts.  I saw it as that serious and frankly, I was trying to be one of the voices to be, like, “Hey, this is a Lehman moment. So back off and, you know, try not to blow up a number of firms.”\n\nAnd I definitely think there is a level of volatility and a duration of volatility, like a set of days where, beyond that, we would see multiple firms blow up. And then there's also a question of international firms blowing up. And then of course, that brings up larger questions about the dollar. I think it'll be weeks, months, maybe even years before we fully understand just how close we came. And there's a lot of people who are keeping their cards very close to the vest because you don't want to say that your firm was, like, 24 hours from blowing up or whatever.\n\nBut I think we're going to learn more extraordinarily alarming things about last Tuesday, last Wednesday than is currently acknowledged. \n\nPaul Krugman: Just for time reference, April 2nd was the first big tariff announcement.\n\nAnd that was a Wednesday. Weeks ago. And then basically a week after that, we were pretty close to the edge of a of a post-Lehmann style financial crisis. And then Trump announced a different set of tariffs that were actually, overall, maybe just as high, but different anyway, and were perceived as a step back from the brink.\n\nAnd so you were saying that the financial system stepped back from the brink, but not that\n\nfar.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah. And volatility is still elevated. And this kind of goes back to the piece I put out the Tuesday before last, so I guess that's April 8th, which talked about the stock market. \n\nThese kinds of markets are conventional wisdom processors. That’s kind of a reference to Friedrich Hayek and the idea of markets as an information processor. It’s a little bit of the same thing but something different. The idea that they’re conventional wisdom processors is that there's a general idea among a certain rarefied group of people who are the most active participants in these markets and what is conventionally believed among them is really\n\nwhat drives things, not access to information that any group of people have. Or a consensus among a different group of people.\n\nThe stock market would change very differently if suddenly, a week from now, all the major\n\nstock traders were scientists. What they would price in, especially around things like climate change, would be very, very different from the current set of participants. So it's important.\n\nThe way people talk about markets is that there is an objective measure.  That they just take information from everywhere and process them. But really, it's a specific set of people.\n\nAs I say in that piece, you would have to have a specific mindset and be a specific person in the world to believe that Donald Trump would be better for the stock market than Joe Biden. To believe not only that Donald Trump would be good for the stock market, that he'd be so much better than having four years of Kamala Harris or whatever, that you can track the odds of\n\nTrump winning with the stock market going up when Trump's odds of winning were going up.\n\nLike that's a particular kind of worldview. You know, people that we don't particularly like, people that we think were kind of nuts might have said that. And of course, not everyone on Wall Street believed that, but enough people believed it on Wall Street that it was taken as a conventional wisdom.\n\nIt's not something that you should sort of fight against when you're trading stocks and\n\ntrading in other financial markets. And that's a uniquely dangerous situation because that kind of person is the kind of person who's going to look for any off ramp, any sort of little sign that things are going to be better. And so when the stock market went up a whole bunch after Trump's announcement and volatility pared back some, it's not so much that these are more protectionist tariffs, at least as of last Wednesday—Of course, it's changed even more in the week since then. It's not like they were great, but it was just a headline in the news that would make people say, “My God, Trump is backing off. Okay, good.”\n\nAnd what matters is not so much the reality of this thinking, but how different factors interact\n\nwith each other. And the media apparatuses present a general mood that comes from a certain perspective. It's so much that Trump needs to actually back off on tariffs or needs to be doing sane tariff policy, it just needs to be perceived as not crazy by these specific kind of idiosyncratic groups of people.\n\nPaul Krugman: Which does raise the question, if he really is going to be crazy, eventually that will filter through. So to some extent we may be getting a reprieve because the conventional wisdom is, it's really not so bad.  But just to say, it took about two hours for people in my circle who actually were doing the tariff numbers to see that these new tariffs are basically the same overall tariff. It’s the same average tariff rate as before.\n\nThey're different, but they're just as bad. The market treated it as a major step back from the cliff. And so that was all that mattered in the moment.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah.\n\nPaul Krugman: It may be motivated reasoning because of the politics, but I'm worried that there is another shoe to drop, that even now markets have not really processed just how unstable things are. Sounds like that's your sense. \n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah. It beggars belief that the tariff policy is not gonna pick up instability and that Trump is not gonna pick some crazy fight where you get into this back and forth between, “is he gonna do it? Is he not gonna do it? Is he gonna do it?” So I think that kind of episode is gonna happen.\n\nThe other thing is just what we started with, the main thing that I've been focusing on, what I've been calling the Trump-Musk payments crisis. The impoundment issues and just sort of taking seizure of the federal government. People used to talk about political risk being part of what gets priced in. Well, there's an enormous amount of political risk in the United States right now.\n\nAnd then there's the further point where they’re in the process of claiming that they can take money out of anyone's bank account or freeze anyone's bank account. It's actually mind-bending trying to keep up with these stories of all the different ways that they're going after bank accounts. I mean, they froze a New York state government bank account related to EPA grants that were already handed out that were being administered by Citibank. And I want to dig into that more and write about it more. But that's just one of, I would say, four or five different payment stories that are calamitous. \n\nLet alone their wanting to move social security off of COBOL, which we talked about. They want to do it within two to three months, and they want to use AI to do it. I mean, that is an existential threat to social security existing. That’s a cockamamie plan. And I don't know what the current state of it is. I've been focusing on the financial crisis, so I need to get back into it. But I don't even know how to articulate how insane a disaster this is. And hey, there's a lot of financial risk if social security breaks and no one's getting social security checks.\n\nAnd these kinds of risks are just like a dime a dozen right now, all across the\n\nadministrative state. And then there are other layers, forgetting even geopolitical things like,\n\nare we invading Greenland? Maybe? All of these things are just so enormous.\n\nThat's why, you know, I didn't think I would succeed, but why in that first week of the Trump-Musk payments crisis, I was pretty conscious in that Odd Lots interview on Bloomberg, to try to really hammer home just how potentially calamitous this is to the financial system and explicitly say that all these financial markets should be pricing in these kind of uncertainties and they are not doing so.\n\nThere are now questions that are burgeoning up on the dollar. I wrote a gigantic monster of a piece about that on Sunday. I'm going to be writing some more big picture things about the dollar this week, but to me, the real question of a disaster, of a crisis, is when these people who suddenly have started to lose faith in the Trump administration's economic policy, that they start looking around and looking for other eventualities. They look at other things that are threats to the dollar, and come across the panoply of things that I've been covering and put two and two together. If this payment system goes down, the whole fiscal machinery that makes the dollar the dollar is gonna collapse.  And then that could potentially be a second wave of the financial crisis.\n\nBut I don't know whether to put it as a bright side or a negative. And right now I'm kind of more inclined to see it as a negative but, even when something is kind of slammed in their face, like Trump's tariffs, they didn't really get the message until he had to slam their faces into the\n\npavement a few times.\n\nSomething like the Trump-Musk payments crisis, it's the kind of thing where, as Joe Weisenthal said at the end of that interview, financial markets will only freak out when something actually breaks. But we can't wait for something to break. That is too dangerous. That's too calamitous.\n\nThey'll show up and say, “man, this problem is so bad,” when the building's already burned\n\ndown and is in a cinder.\n\nPaul Krugman: Maybe we should leave it there. I need a drink.\n\nNathan Tankus: Well, let's get that drink.\n\nLast thing I wanted to mention, and this is also a sign of how bad the crisis is: My lease on an office in Manhattan started yesterday, 2,000 square feet. And so, for listeners who want to support that kind of effort, make sure that that venture is a success, kind of expanding notes on the crises into a bigger deal, you know, please take out a subscription, send a tip. Everything helps right now as I expand out my reporting and bring on some really amazing people to contribute to do some of the things that I've been doing on different topics.\n\nPaul Krugman: Okay, we're gonna need it. So good luck and hope that DOGE doesn't freeze your payment for the office space.\n\nOkay, thanks for coming on.\n\nNathan Tankus: Of course.\n\nPaul Krugman: I'm sure that you will have plenty of work to do, alas.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yes, unfortunately. I’ll have to go visit my office.\n\nPaul Krugman: Take care.\n\n","html":"<div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/support\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Tip!</a></div><p>Exactly seven weeks since the first interview Krugman did with me was published, I have <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/nathan-tankus-part-ii?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">another interview to bring readers</a>. It's quite surreal to be something like a regular correspondent for Paul Krugman on what’s happening. Even more so because this interview is not particularly focused on, say, the Treasury’s internal payments system or the technicalities of the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/can-the-trump-administration-arbitrarily-take-money-from-anyones-bank-account/\"><u>Automated Clearing House payments system</u></a>. Instead it's focused on the bread and butter elements that make up a modern financial crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>One reason this is surreal for me is that <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/musk-in-your-computers-paul-krugman-interviews-nathan-tankus/\"><u>I first got interested in economics</u></a> when, in January 2009, I took a class called “Show Me the Money” at <a href=\"https://www.friendsofurban.org/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Urban Academy Laboratory High School</u></a> that was all about the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 that had just happened. Krugman’s articles were a regular feature in that class. I don’t think I could have imagined then that sixteen years later Paul Krugman would be <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/nathan-tankus-part-ii?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">regularly inviting me onto his “show”</a> to explain what’s going on- including with a burgeoning financial crisis. Life truly takes you to strange places.</p><p>Speaking of strange surreal experiences, it's time to tell readers other exciting news: I’ve signed a lease for a Notes on the Crises office in Manhattan! It is unbelievable that the generous support of readers has gotten me to this point, but it has. My vision for this office- in its entire 2000 square feet glory- will be explained in detail in the coming weeks and months. For now I’ll just say that this office will allow me to greatly expand my activities and facilitate creating a community of interested experts, researchers, freelancers, and volunteers- and with enough funding and support, perhaps even employees…- to do more reporting on a greater number of topics. It also facilitates me building a professional audio/video set up so that Notes on the Crises does not simply live in the written word. Furnishing the office is moving quickly and the office should be functional, and open to interested parties, by the end of next week. For security reasons I am keeping the location of the office confidential- events with subscribers will happen elsewhere.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdQFQM_IoN6m2ucGBFxvjEP3jrZtJSO4-qDNqRTjLfib5VXQBBfWcCBwt1wmYn0TnLb5pImxx1s3ZO99wT5U1OSpjZKBeVv-PDSBIXmSYOpig-iJcC0E0p13M3TFDnO8x-2EcGn?key=Y6t9ZVrhgyudXS40X4KxmSDH\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"468\"></figure><p>Finally, I’d like to end with what I said in the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/musk-in-your-computers-paul-krugman-interviews-nathan-tankus/\"><u>previous Krugman interview:</u></a></p><blockquote><strong>If you want to take on Krugman’s concern</strong> about what happens<strong> “if you get hit by a truck”</strong> and my answer “If someone out there who's watching this or reading the transcript wants to put up a budget, $500,000 or a million to train up people and, you know, make me replaceable, I'm more than eager to train up my redundancies.”&nbsp; You are more than welcome to email me at <a href=\"mailto:Crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><u>Crisesnotes@gmail.com</u></a> or contact me on signal at NathanTankus.01</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KfymwafbYrk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Liquidity, Volatility and Market Craziness: Paul Krugman Interviews Nathan Tankus Again\"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Youtube video here: </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfymwafbYrk&ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfymwafbYrk</strong></a><strong>  </strong></p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/musk-in-your-computers-an-interviewhttps://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/nathan-tankus-part-ii?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong><u>Paul Krugman’s Introduction:</u></strong></a></p><p>Nathan Tankus has become an essential resource during these strange and scary times.

Paul Krugman again.</p><p>I'm doing a second session with Nathan Tankus, who is everywhere these days.</p><p>He's really in the middle of it. And last time we spoke it was really about DOGE which has by no means gone away as an issue but we're also having crazy action in the financial markets, which is in some ways, Nathan, where you came into this whole discussion. I want to try and actually figure it out myself, but also walk listeners through what's going on.</p><p>So welcome. I guess this is my show these days.</p><p>You were actually warning about a potential financial crisis before the whole post Rose Garden stuff. You want to tell us about what you were thinking and we can go from there?</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yeah. So, I've been calling this series since it started January 31st, the “Trump-Musk payments crisis.” And so this is a lot of <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/musk-in-your-computers-an-interview?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>what we talked about last time</u></a>, All of the different ways that this system could blow up. We really emphasized that what the DOGE people are messing with at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service is literally the ability to make treasury payments. And in fact, what they're doing is so catastrophic that making treasury payments is kind of the least of the concerns. That'll be the most immediate thing, but like, you know, not getting money in the hospitals, not being able to collect taxes…&nbsp;</p><p>It’s hard to wrap your mind around this because it's so big, it’s kind of beyond a fiscal heart attack. Just, like, making the fiscal machinery of government completely break down. And they</p><p>clearly have not really understood that they've been messing with that.</p><p>And then an added layer, which <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/can-the-trump-administration-arbitrarily-take-money-from-anyones-bank-account/\"><u>I started covering around mid-March</u></a> and had been investigating for a few weeks is that they took $80 million from New York City&nbsp; or they debited New York City's account for $80 million. That kind of might sound complicated, but it's just like any time that you make a credit card payment, you're authorizing your credit card company to debit your account, so you make the payment. All sorts of other debits or credits are authorized by all sorts of actors, but sometimes these debits aren't authorized. Sometimes they're just done without warning.</p><p>And normally what happens is, if you do that kind of thing, it's considered fraud and you get frozen out of the payment system if you do it too much. But in this case, because it's the federal government, there's no actor to freeze the federal government out of the payment system once there's a question.</p><p>In some fundamental sense, the whole concept of money is making a payment, and then that payment is done. That debt is canceled. You've figured it out. Maybe there's some legal dispute that comes up, and they decide to sue you after. But that's a whole new legal environment. There's no taking it back without going through any legal process unless you're the federal government. And from all the experts I've talked to and some anonymous sources, it seems like&nbsp; there's no guardrail on their ability to just take money out of anyone's account.</p><p>That's messing fundamentally with the concept of money. When money is physical cash and I can hand you some dollar bills and then you can walk away, the idea that the payment is final is kind of easier. I have to go track you down, chase you down, have a court case to find you and send some people out there. But with accounts, there's always that awkward question of, can I just take the money back in your account? And we have all sorts of legal and operational niceties that makes that concept go further and further from your mind.</p><p>Obviously, there are people who experience these kinds of things already: immigrants before the recent crisis, sex workers, you know, there are all sorts of people at the margins of the</p><p>financial system who know about how kind of shaky payment finality can be, but it's not a</p><p>generalized thing in the whole society. It's not, for example, taking money out of New York City's bank account.</p><p>And so, connecting it back to the financial crisis is, if you start recognizing that the United States government is undermining the concept that a payment is a payment is a payment and that there's payment finality and that you have the idea that at any moment your bank account can be frozen, debited, anything else, and that you can't really trust having money in the bank,</p><p>even if it's to deposit insured because the Trump administration is taking the prerogative that they can just take anything from you. If financial markets took this seriously, this would already be like a burgeoning financial crisis.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>In some ways, I feel like we should be spending all our time on that. But on top of that, we have what looks to me to be a pretty big market dislocation. Nevermind the stock market though I think we both agree that that's not the right barometer but we're looking at bond markets, currency markets and while stuff has been happening and I thought I was ready after 2008 for weird stuff to happen in markets, but now we're getting a whole new level of weird and I've been reading you to try and understand.</p><p>So maybe first, just your initial take on what's been happening since Trump held up</p><p>his piece of cardboard in the Rose Garden.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> So we could talk about all sorts of complicated details. And of course,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/trumps-liberation-day-and-the-ongoing-stock-market-crash/\"><u> I've written</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>literally</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>16,000 words</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>on all the complicated details</u></a> since last week. But in the big picture, the details are just to solidify the basic above the fold take, which is:&nbsp; this is an extraordinary financial crisis because it is a financial crisis, more than any other financial crisis ever, that is directly connected to the erratic and bizarre and dangerous behavior of one person.</p><p>And it's not simply the things that he's doing, but the sort of erratic moment to moment</p><p>decision making. In certain ways, if Trump just committed to causing a depression, if he just committed like, “we're gonna do these tariffs,” and he could credibly commit, to “we're going to cause a depression,” it would, of course, have all sorts of knock-on effects, but we wouldn't have had the financial crisis that we essentially had that, despite a lull, I think we're still in the middle of, because the financial crisis was specifically about the erratic-ness of his decisions.</p><p>For younger people on the internet, there's a kind of joke, like, “it's so over. We're so back.”</p><p>“It's so over. We're so back,” which is just the idea where something bad happens and then you're like, “everything's done.” And then something good happens. You're like, “we're so back.</p><p>Everything's great.” You know, “we're on top of the world.” And essentially the stock market has been behaving on a “it's so over, we're so back” mindset of just, “Trump is going to crash everything. No wait, the business people are in charge and actually things are going to be okay.”</p><p>And they have been trading on that news in this frantic way, moment to moment, where even like a fake headline about Trump backing off on tariffs can, within 15 minutes. create and then take back $2.5 trillion of value on the stock market. And so that's the top line thing: this is a crisis of just Trump's erraticness and Wall Street perceives Trump as somewhat less erratic this week. So the volatility has gone down and so it's not such a crisis. So, if you can believe that Trump will stop, will not be so erratic in the future, then you might be able to believe that this financial crisis is over.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> And by the way, that’s not just financial, it's real. I mean, real investments, plant and equipment investments and so on. Who can make those investments when they have no idea what policy will be a week from now? But the mechanics. Normally you would expect tariffs to strengthen the dollar. Instead it's weakened. Normally we see interest rates go up, but it's been really weird. It's a spike in interest rates. Interest rates should strengthen the dollar, but it's weakened. And then there are lots of individual markets where spreads have widened a lot.</p><p>What I learned from you is that the picture we all kind of have of this kind of smoothly</p><p>functioning financial system is really wrong. <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>You wrote about it</u></a>, and maybe I should let you talk and try to explain, then I'll see if I can add or just reveal my confusion about all of that.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yeah. So the way I would put it is: Trump's erratic and bizarre behavior has kind of intersected with a set of longstanding financial regulatory and macro financial issues that a lot of experts have been talking about, at least aspects of, for the last decade. You know, a kind of conversation that was burgeoning in the circles that I run in.</p><p>So to back up, we had a great financial crisis in 2007-2008, largely associated with how the banks failed, they didn't have enough capital, and then also there were these sets of liquidity issues.</p><p>And so there's a committee called the <a href=\"https://files.crisesnotes.com/reviewofkeynesianeconomics.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Basel Committee on Banking Supervision</u></a>, which is an</p><p>informal committee, but has developed a lot of informal power, which is basically a meeting of a bunch of financial regulators. The United States, Japan, Europe, coming together to come up with ways to reorganize the financial system. And they've done this a few different times. There was a time in the 80s called Basel I. There was a time in, like, the late 90s, early 2000s called Basel II. And then post financial crisis, we got Basel III.</p><p>The big thing about Basel II that a lot of people hammered on was: Basel II tried to focus things on risk-weighted capital requirements. So that's a way of talking about, okay, certain assets are a lot less risky than others, so maybe you shouldn't have to have as much net worth devoted to protecting yourself from losses for safer assets.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> For listeners, traditional banks take deposits, lend out the money, but we want</p><p>a bank to have some of its own money at stake, partly as a cushion so that if it takes losses on its lending, it can come out of the bank's capital, partly so that the bank has some skin in the game so that it doesn't take on due risks. And Basel II tried to say, the amount of capital should depend on how risky are the assets you're buying in. And they came up with a scheme for that. So that's really what you're describing.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yeah. So, to kind of roll that out a little bit, if a bank <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-are-banks-special-monetary-policy/\"><u>just got a rubber stamped bank license</u></a>, like, “Hey, you want a bank license? Let's get you a bank license.” And you suddenly had the ability to create money and access the Fed, you make a bunch of loans and then you have assets and you have deposits. And the issue is: if you take any loss whatsoever, then your net worth, your equity (basically just assets minus liabilities) is negative. And for various reasons, this idea of easily getting a bank license <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-are-banks-special-monetary-policy/\"><u>only to have your net worth go negative</u></a>, is not something that financial regulators have ever wanted to incentivize.</p><p>So what they do is, they say to <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-are-banks-special-monetary-policy/\"><u>someone who's proposing a business plan for a bank</u></a>, “hey,</p><p>you need to have some starting out net worth so we know as you're getting going and you're making mistakes and you take some losses, that your net worth is not going to just be negative and that you're not, essentially, just getting to piggyback on the public dime, and so you don’t have the ability to just, like, change the world by making loans without anything on your end. So what you do is,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-are-banks-special-monetary-policy/\"><u> you find “investors.”</u></a> You sell them stock. They get this stock and say, “this is a nice stock.” And then they pay you money and that money becomes money in your account at the Federal Reserve. Then, on an accounting basis, you're starting out with your assets worth a lot more than your liabilities. And that's great.</p><p>And so as you start making loans and so on, then you have that <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-are-banks-special-monetary-policy/\"><u>cushion of net worth to take losses</u></a>. And for kind of obvious reasons, you want to make sure that people don't make so many loans and so many risky loans that they collapse, but they're still able to make a certain amount of loans.</p><p>A lot of people showed up and said, “well, it should depend on the riskiness.” For example, owning a treasury bill, at least traditionally, forgetting everything that's happened in the last year or the last four months, is a lot safer than making<a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> a loan to a local real estate developer</u></a>. And so why should you have to have the protection of a bunch of net worth against the treasury security the same way as you would for the loan? And so that makes sense a little bit, but the problem is in the details.</p><p>The problem is, okay, what is actual risk? How do you measure risk? How do you come up with that? And it's a lot harder and it's a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>lot easier to game than it seems on the surface</u></a>. And in particular, what Basel II said was, “We're gonna trust the bank's internal models of risk. And as long as their internal models of risk say it's okay, then it's okay.”</p><p>And I don't think it takes very much intellectual effort to think of all the ways that that</p><p>could blow up. And there are all sorts of details about how that got messed with and how that was manipulated to let the banks take on extraordinary amounts of risk without seeming like</p><p>those risks were there. That's a whole thing on the 2007, 2008 financial crisis. Whole books have been written about that topic.</p><p>But for today’s purposes, what's important is, Basel III showed up and said, “Okay, we went a little too crazy with the risk weighting. We need to just have a sort of backstop. We need to have, especially for the largest banks, a supplementary leverage requirement. So we'll have risk weighted, but we'll make sure we'll sanity check by saying, ‘there's this size of your balance sheet relative to your net worth that you can't go beyond.’” And then at the same time, which we can get into a little bit more, there were all sorts of things that they did on the liquidity side. But that's the big picture. And we'll talk a little bit more about how this has led into the crisis.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>Yeah, so Basel III set kind of a floor on capital, right? And then we've been operating under that regime. And what did that do?</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>So, these largest banks at a tactical level, at a corporate level, <a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>they're called “bank holding companies.</u></a>” And what that means is, they're not just the nice little chartered bank that has an account at the Federal Reserve. They have all these other subsidiaries that engage in all sorts of different activities. These are really kind of colossal institutions. And traditionally, going way back to the ‘50s, ‘60s and such, there was a technical part of the Federal Reserve Act which reached into these companies and limited how <a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>much the bank part could support the non-bank parts.</u></a></p><p>And there’s a really under-reported part of the 2007- 2008 financial crisis about this. <a href=\"https://www.law.upenn.edu/faculty/sto12?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Saule Omarova</u></a>, who was Biden's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency nominee, who was a Cornell Law professor, now I believe at University of Pennsylvania, has <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4513&context=nclr&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>a really great paper from 2011 that's all about this issue.</u></a></p><p>And one of the under-reported parts about the financial crisis is: as the banking system was starting to experience issues essentially about making payments, about being able to finance itself, especially on the putatively non-bank part of these bank holding companies, what they started to do was <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4513&context=nclr&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>give waivers to these protections to let the bank part finance</u></a> everything else, to essentially let finance leak out of the bank part to the non-bank parts. And that was their way of trying to<a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4513&context=nclr&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> keep things on the even keel</u></a>. Of course, at a certain point it got too big for this kind of maneuver, but what that meant was that post financial crisis, it was like, “okay.” When things are hard with the largest banks, they're always just gonna let liquidity go wherever. They're not gonna keep to the original mechanism of trying to keep these things separate. If we're gonna deal with this, then w<a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>e need to kind of assume that liquidity can go anywhere, that funds can go anywhere within a bank holding company</u></a>. And so we need regulations on the whole bank holding company.</p><p>And so these leverage requirements are on the whole bank holding company. And their</p><p>liquidity requirements, these requirements of how many essentially “high quality liquid financial assets” they need to have. And we can talk about whether they're actually high quality liquid financial assets, but regardless, they have to hold these in case they need to make payments.</p><p>Basically, what this did was, it made these balance sheets quite rigid. You know, on one hand, you have banks that have what <a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>are supposed to be liquid assets</u></a>, that they're unwilling to use most of the time, even during stress times, because the regulations tell them they’ve got to hold onto these supposedly liquid assets. And at the same time, their balance sheets are kind of rigid now. They can't move up and down the way that they could before, especially for things that</p><p>were supposed to be low risk. And so this brings us to the treasury market. I don't know if you want to…</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>So, alright. I think where we're going is that with the regulations, in some sense, it's fighting the last war issue.&nbsp; The regulations were designed to limit the risk of a 2008 style crisis. And as I understand it, basically the restrictions on bank holding companies forced or led other institutions to step into the breach. Is that what really is happening?</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> Exactly. And this kind of gets to the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>fundamental concept of liquidity.</u></a></p><p>Liquidity is the idea that: I've got an asset and I can sell it or make a payment at a certain amount, accounted for value. The obvious example is a dollar bill. A dollar bill is a dollar and I can make a payment with the dollar. I can go to my bank and deposit a dollar in my account.</p><p>That's not perfect liquidity, but pretty darn good. And same thing with money in my checking account from the perspective of me as an individual.</p><p>But there are all sorts of assets out there. There are stocks, bonds, currencies. There are all sorts of assets, and trillions and trillions of dollars of assets. And by virtue of being assets, of being out there, someone has to own them. And if you own them, you have to hold them. And one of the under-commented strengths of the previous system was that balance sheets could expand and contract a lot as you need it, specifically around treasury bonds.</p><p>So, okay, however many billions of treasuries that are being auctioned, where people</p><p>want to sell more treasuries, there's a dealer. There's a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>government bond dealer that is in a bank holding company</u></a> saying, “we'll make money if we expand our balance sheet and buy up some treasuries. So we'll do that. And hey people, there's a lot of demand for treasuries right now. Our balance sheet can shrink as we sell off these treasuries and we pay back our</p><p>liabilities.”</p><p>And this created a kind of flexibility,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u> this ebb and flow where treasuries were liquid because there was a balance sheet that could always absorb them</u></a> when they needed to be absorbed.</p><p>Someone's balance sheet could expand and take them on. And it didn't require a whole bunch of action from the Federal Reserve because the Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>could sort of just cultivate these larger conditions</u></a>. And we didn't really notice that it was really the public backstopping all these things through all these powers that we've delegated.</p><p>And the treasury market, it being the “most liquid market in the world” and being stable in that way, was related to<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u> these bank holding company dealers whose balance sheet could expand and contract.</u></a></p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> So I just have a clarifying question. The treasury is just US federal government debt. Are you using it to mean only the short-term treasury bills or are you including the longer maturities?</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>I'm including all of it.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> But basically anybody who’d want to sell federal government debt could easily do that, which we took for granted, but was actually because there were these dealers who were basically in the bank holding companies who were the residual buyers who would always step in. But that was then.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yeah, exactly, exactly. They <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>were the residual buyers</u></a>. But we still had to deal with this risk problem. To have an absolute constraint on the whole balance sheet, the question became who's going to be the new buyer. And we should say big banks have talked about this.</p><p>Like, let's exempt treasuries from leverage requirements. And there's a whole complicated set of <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/csfrayer.bsky.social/post/3lmkyayhiik2f?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>debates for why regulators, why good governance types have not wanted to do that</u></a>. And there's questions about whether it would fully deal with the issue and there's stuff with liquidity requirements.</p><p>But putting all that aside, fundamentally, whether or not there was an easy fix on the regulation side, you still need to have a residual buyer. And what has stepped in as the residual buyer has <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>been hedge funds, these types of investors</u></a>. They find high net worth institutions like pension funds and universities, and they sell them what are called limited partner shares. And basically they're able to go to town and make investments and say, “Hey, we'll get you a good return.” And what these entities have been doing in terms of, like, picking pennies off the ground, has expanded their balance sheet by buying treasuries, and they have been hedging themselves, essentially.</p><p>So there's a kind of product that institutions can buy that is supposedly safer, especially for those long end treasuries of 30 year, or 10 year terms. And so these funds <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>have become the residual buyer</u></a>.&nbsp; They have stepped into the void <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>created by a lack of monetary design</u></a> by the</p><p>federal government. So something grew up to take on this role.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> Okay, so until a few months ago, if you were trying to sell US government debt, it would be very easy to do, you wouldn't be disturbing the price. But what many of us didn't realize was that actually it was a hedge fund that would step in and they would expect to be able to unload it but what made the assets easier to sell was the role of the hedge funds,</p><p>which is a little alarming because people have always worried about hedge funds and whether they might be a systemic risk. And for most of my professional life, the answer was, “well, no, not really.” But now you're saying that they're in the middle of the system.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus</strong>&nbsp; Yeah, absolutely. And so people started becoming conscious of this around September 2019. There was a little hiccup, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/looking-back-at-repo-madness-one/\"><u>called repo madness</u></a>, but then March 2020 comes around. In <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>March 2020, the treasury market</u></a> started to [experience] dysfunction. And it was that moment where people started recognizing this. The Federal Reserve, of course, stepped in and bought <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>trillions of dollars of treasuries</u></a>. At that time, I was pointing to the fact that <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u>we were covertly supporting the treasury market in these previous instances</u></a>. We were covertly doing all these things.</p><p>It's a lot more obscure when the Federal Reserve issues a <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4513&context=nclr&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>waiver to a technical regulation</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4513&context=nclr&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>from the Federal Reserve Act no one's ever heard of in 2007</u></a> than when the Federal Reserve</p><p>announces in 2020 that it's going to be buying treasuries.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> So, March 2020, in case people have short memories, that's when COVID</p><p>starts.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yes, exactly. So COVID was a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>period of intense instability, dysfunction, and dysregulation</u></a>. And in that moment, hedge funds started backing away and the treasury market started to dysfunction. We can talk about why hedge funds started backing away and the kind of problems there. But what I want to emphasize here is that <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u>when the Federal Reserve did that, people said</u></a>,&nbsp; “My God, the interventionist Federal Reserve is borrowing trillions of dollars in securities.”</p><p>But <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u>from my point of view</u></a>, they were issuing waivers so that bank holding companies could provide whatever funds that the rest of the company needed. This was as interventionist an action from the Federal Reserve to support the Treasury market or support liquidity in these other markets as it would have been<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u> for the Federal Reserve to be buying it themselves</u></a>. It's just that one <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u>way is kind of covert</u></a>. It's sleepy. It's obscure. It's very difficult to understand. And <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u>one's kind of direct.</u></a></p><p>The story is, the Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u>bought Treasury securities</u></a>, so then they're more liquid because they bought them. It's a thing that people can kind of grasp from maybe a macroeconomics 101 class whereas the kind of sleepy regulation thing is more difficult. I read <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4513&context=nclr&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>a whole law review article</u></a> about it from <a href=\"https://www.law.upenn.edu/faculty/sto12?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Biden's OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] nominee</u></a> and that's how I know about it.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>Alright.&nbsp; So, in March 2020 there was a freeze up in the treasuries market and because the world had become wildly uncertain because of Covid, so the federal reserve stepped in and bought treasuries.&nbsp; But there was a period there when they actually were hard to sell. And basically five years later, almost to the day, we get another seize up, this time</p><p>not because of a virus, but because of Donald Trump. And what you're saying is that basically hedge funds were not able to do their normal role. I think I know how that happens, but maybe you should spell that out a bit.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yeah. It's kind of funny to me because, you know, we were talking about Basel II and all that stuff about the risk weighted capital requirements. Well, we kind of have this bifurcated system where we solve the problems for the <a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>previous iteration of financial regulations</u></a>. You know, we solve Basel II with <a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Basel III for banks and for bank holding companies</u></a>. Or we think we've solved it.</p><p>But then it's not like these kinds of <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>risk management practices have gone away</u></a>. I mean, they're not as bad as they used to be, but fundamentally, at the basic level, it's a lot of the same stuff.</p><p>The banks in 2005, in 2006, 2007 used <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>value-at-risk models</u></a>, which is a type of model of</p><p>trying to calculate risk from historical data, especially recent historical data, to see how risky, how volatile things are, to judge <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>how risky what they're doing is</u></a>. And so what happens when <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>volatility goes up a lot</u></a>, the value-at-risk model says, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>“there's a lot more risk out there.”</u></a></p><p>And then, again, they have that conversation about capital, about financial net worth. You're only supposed to be taking on a certain amount of risk for a certain amount of net worth or a “certain amount of capital”. When the risk models blow out suddenly, you're<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u> taking on way too much risk for your amount of capital</u></a> and the risk models are telling you, “you've got to deleverage, you've got to sell assets, pay back debts, shrink your balance sheet.”</p><p>But remember, the whole point, the reason that the hedge funds have become important in</p><p>the first place is that their balance sheets <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>can expand when they need to expand</u></a>. And so this is now creating<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u> the classic pro-cyclical situation</u></a>. Liquidity is there when you don't really feel like you need it, and when you really feel like you need it, it's not there.</p><p>Lev Menand, law professor at Columbia, and his colleague Josh Younger, who used to be at the New York Federal Reserve, called them <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>shadow dealers</u></a>. Shadow dealers are kind of similar to shadow money in the sense that they're providing this treasury dealer role. They're in the market to buy and sell, but <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>only when the times are good</u></a>. Normal dealers are licensed by the Federal Reserve. They are supposed to <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>always be there in the market</u></a>. They're always supposed to be bidding on auctions and the privileges that they get are supposed to come with <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>certain responsibilities</u></a>, and of course hedge funds have none of those responsibilities.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> So, what's happened now is that you’ve got volatility. Nobody knows what tariffs are going to be in place three days from now. And that ends up weighing on hedge funds, which feel the need to contract. I guess I would throw in that when you mentioned picking up pennies, I'm old enough to remember long-term capital management, which was a gigantic hedge fund and people always said that their business model was vacuuming up pennies from under the couch cushions on a global scale, and it was great until it wasn't, and then suddenly blew up and markets froze in 1998 when that happened. And you're saying that actually what we're looking at now is something like that happening again except now it’s the market for US treasuries that actually is freezing up.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yes. But the same sort of things are happening in all sorts of different markets that, superficially, you might not see as directly related to the initial thing. For various complicated historical reasons over the last 15 years, a system has been built up where if things get too erratic, liquidity dries up in <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>all these different parts of the system</u></a>. And there's no balance sheet that is able or willing to absorb what's going on, unless of course it's the Federal Reserve or the Federal Government's balance sheet.&nbsp;</p><p>But there's no private sector balance sheet that's willing to absorb the</p><p>assets <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>that are on there</u></a>. And where it comes back to Donald Trump. You have a system that works <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>unless volatility goes above a certain level</u></a>, Donald Trump is the perfect thing to give a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>heart attack to the system because he is volatility encapsulated</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> Okay, so it really is these highly leveraged actors out there who are really critical. You're saying it’s a market for treasuries and presumably a lot of other stuff as well. I mean, you're seeing spreads blow out on not just junk bonds, but sort of BAA corporate bonds, that sort of thing.</p><p>So the new climate of uncertainty basically forces the hedge funds—or high leverage</p><p>actors, but I guess that's basically hedge funds—to contract and sell stuff. And so you get spiking interest rates even on heretofore the safest assets in the world. For some of us, the fall on the dollar, that's different from March 2020. At that time, the dollar actually went up because America was still the safe haven. So why is the dollar now falling in the middle of all of this?</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>So, I think there's a few different things there. Before we get to exactly where the dollar is or why the dollar is falling in this situation, what I would emphasize is that liquidity is drying up everywhere.&nbsp; When I say everywhere,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u> I mean everywhere</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Liquidity in, like,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u> essentially currency trading</u></a>. The foreign exchange market also <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>kind of seized up last week</u></a>. There was an article in risk.net that said liquidity in the foreign exchange spot market was <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>worse than during COVID</u></a>. Some of these same things happened in COVID, but this happened more. And the article says that relative to the period leading up to this, volatility within a day (financial market participants use the phrase “intraday” for that) but <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>volatility went up more than five times</u></a>.</p><p>And so that volatility explosion is really the thing that's important in the foreign exchange market. Suddenly you really need to have big, big price movements where some entity with a balance sheet decides to step in and <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>absorb some position or another.</u></a></p><p>This also connects up to the last 15 years. These things are <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>called foreign exchange swaps</u></a>.</p><p>There's the type of derivative where you swap one currency for another, you swap yen for dollars, and then it'll go back the other way. You'll swap it at a different price at some time down the line—a week, a month, three months, whatever. And these have become the kind of focal <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>point of the financial system</u></a>.</p><p>As of June 2024, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>there was $113 trillion worth of foreign exchange swaps</u></a> out in the world, which is a mind-numbing number. The vast majority of that had dollars on one side. <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>87% of those swaps involved dollars</u></a>, which is a truly astounding amount. Dollars are so important to this system that generally speaking, when a Japanese bank wants euros or a European bank or a British bank wants yen, they don't just swap. The obvious thing would be to swap yen for euros.</p><p>Instead, they first swap yen for dollars and then swap dollars for euros. The dollar<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u> serves even as an intermediary between Japan and Europe, it's so central in these foreign exchange markets.</u></a></p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>Yeah. We call it the vehicle currency and it's what you take to get a ride from one currency to the other. But that role depends on dealers and the dealers need liquidity.&nbsp;</p><p>Wow. Okay.</p><p>So what you're saying is that all the foreign exchange markets, presumably corporate bond markets, treasuries, all of it depends upon liquidity supplied largely by hedge funds.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yes, in our current system. But<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u> also foreign hedge funds</u></a>. It's not just that domestic hedge funds have pulled back. It's also that there are foreign hedge funds. And this is where these foreign exchange swaps come in. I wrote a piece a couple of years ago called <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>The Utopian Vision of Financial Derivatives</u></a>,&nbsp; and what that piece was getting at is, if you're an ordinary person you might think lending to a New York real estate developer or lending to a regional Japanese government or lending to a British oil and gas company, that these are all different things.</p><p>But if you <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>have a certain kind of lens</u></a>, if you see the world through a certain set of rose-tinted glasses, all the financial market participant <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>sees are different kinds of risks that can be mixed and matched</u></a>. And I can turn any of those assets <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>into a kind of treasury bill</u></a>. I’ve just got to buy the right derivatives. So if I'm worried about them defaulting, then I can buy a credit default swap, which is just insurance against default. If I'm worried about the interest rates moving in a way that's bad for me, I'll buy an interest rate swap.</p><p>And so you can sort of just construct any sort of asset you want. And this works as long as you don't have to worry about actually getting paid by the other person who has your derivative. And this of course was <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>the big thing in the 2008 financial crisis</u></a>.&nbsp; The insurance giant AIG took one side of all of those <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>credit default swap bets and then couldn't pay up</u></a>. And then the federal government had to step in.</p><p>But even putting <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>aside the counterparty stuff</u></a>, there's also just this basic question of liquidity. My model says that when this certain event happens, the value of this asset will go down. But the model says the derivative should go up just enough to offset it. And so I haven't actually taken any loss. But the problem is, you don't actually know what's <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>going to be happening in the</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>liquidity</u></a>, whether the model value will line up because of things that can be going on in the world. For example, liquidity drying up everywhere. And there's no such thing as a private sector liquidity swap. And of course, even if there were, the obvious question would be: who guarantees liquidity for the liquidity swap?</p><p>And so ultimately, what happens is, there are all these investors who make decisions based on the idea that risks are just all swappable and they can get whatever kind of portfolio that they want with these products. And then it doesn't work in crisis times.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>Okay, and so we get this possibility that increased volatility means that the people who supply liquidity kind of go away, which means that all of these investments that were</p><p>supposed to be safe or at least limited risk because you had derivatives start to become</p><p>really problematic. So that's what you think is happening now to the markets.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yeah, when volatility goes down, it gets better. But volatility is elevated if you <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>look at things like the VIX</u></a>, which is an index everyone relies on. It has gone down some. So things are kind of a little bit calmer right now, but they're still <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>quite elevated compared to what they were before all this started</u></a>. With other financial crises, there's all sorts of financial indicators that you can look at to judge whether a crisis is gonna get more severe. The issue is, because everything is just related to volatility and the volatility in this <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>situation is just related to Trump, there's no real financial expertise that can tell you exactly where this is going</u></a>. It's like, you just need a psychologist. You need someone who's somehow an expert in Trump's mind palace or the people around Trump and how they can manipulate him (or not) to judge whether</p><p>volatility is going to explode next week or whether it'll settle down and he'll just, you know, flip channels and not get so focused on the news that week.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> Yeah. So what's strange is that it's not even so much the level of tariffs. It’s the fact that you don't know what they're going to be. We had one radical break in the tariff regime on April 2nd and then it zipped in a completely different direction on April 9th and then another big change on April 12th. And that's what's really the problem.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> And that's why I said the financial system would do a lot better if Trump just committed to creating a depression. Then you'd be like, “okay, he's going to raise tariffs a lot.</p><p>He's going to stick to it. It's going to cause a global recession. But we know it's going to cause a global recession.” The <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>volatility now has been about trying to predict what will happen</u></a>. And all the back and forth. And those huge swings between “the economy will be fine” vs. “a depression is coming” is what's interacting with these <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>extant vulnerabilities in the financial system</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>I would say it's not clear you would be causing a depression if the policy</p><p>were stable. If we just had 25% tariffs. And everybody knew that was stable, then that would be a bad thing, but business would work with it. And it's not known whether they're 25% or 10% or 100%. That is the problem.</p><p>All right. In 2020, the Fed just stepped in and bought lots of treasuries. Is there a simple technical fix to this one? Why doesn't Jerome Powell just step in and rescue us from all of this?</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> Well, there's a couple things.&nbsp; We're talking about it kind of happening everywhere, and it kind of did happen everywhere in 2020, which is why there were all those <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-big-unanswered-questions-about/\"><u>other facilities around corporate debt</u></a>, around <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-reserves-coronavirus-f6a/\"><u>municipalities and so on</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>So these were not just treasury bonds. I didn't even know that. I'm embarrassed, but they did a bunch of facilities for other markets as well, not just buying Treasuries?</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-reserves-coronavirus-f6a/\"><u>Yeah, absolutely.</u></a></p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>Okay. So, sorry, go on.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>And so, they can step in on the liquidity issues. They're still worried about inflation and the tariffs are bringing up the question of inflation even more. So it’s kind of a full spectrum thing. They probably wouldn't do it unless <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/trumps-liberation-day-and-the-ongoing-stock-market-crash/\"><u>things got really, really bad</u></a>. But, I would expect,&nbsp; if the treasury market had gotten too chaotic for them, I think they would have</p><p>stepped in. And I think ultimately, even if there’s some awkwardness between some of the</p><p>things that they had said coming into this crisis, they would do that. And it would basically be fine.</p><p>The problem is, you know, in 2007, 2008, the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>volatility was about financial instability and recognizing the financial instability</u></a>. So stepping in to stabilize financial markets could slow down or make the volatility go away. But, you know, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/trumps-liberation-day-and-the-ongoing-stock-market-crash/\"><u>Jerome Powell can't make the volatility of Donald Trump go away.</u></a></p><p>And the Fed, for various reasons, both political but also kind of practical, wouldn't want to try to do a big audacious step in to deal with all the dysfunction related to Trump being unstable. I think if you ask them at a press conference, it would be like, “Well, it's the president's response.</p><p>The president is making a certain amount of decisions and he is pursuing a certain amount of economic policy and it's not our role to countermand him. And so if he wants to create a whole bunch of instability for his own reasons, that's essentially his business and we'll be concerned and we'll look at all the markets. But, you know, we hope there's a resolution to this and yada, yada, yada.”</p><p>So, doing a whole bunch of things probably wouldn't work that well and would also be stepping into the void or getting in the middle of this very charged political set of issues. As long as the Treasury can still make payments,&nbsp; they can let Trump get to a certain point and see if there's kind of a resolution to this situation. The Fed doesn’t want to be involved with this at all, or as little as it can. They would prefer there to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/19/powell-debt-ceiling-fed-00092522?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>be a political resolution</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And you kind of see similar things at a much lesser scale <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/more-foia-memos-the-feds-2013-treasury-default-memo-just-in-time-for-another-round-of-debt-ceiling-politics/\"><u>around the debt ceiling crises</u></a>, where they've tried to really step out of the way and see it as a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/more-foia-memos-the-feds-2013-treasury-default-memo-just-in-time-for-another-round-of-debt-ceiling-politics/\"><u>political issue to be resolved and only step in if they think something is irreversibly broken</u></a> or if that seems like it is about to happen.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>Okay, I'm not sure if this is a devil's advocate argument or not,&nbsp; but is there kind of a floor on how bad things can get? Because if the Fed steps in with facilities to address these kinds of balance sheets, and all the volatility contagion, if it's bad enough, they can always make sure that there is enough liquidity. They are essentially the buyer of last resort for a lot of assets.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Let me think about that. I think to a certain extent that's true, but only for short bursts.&nbsp; There's just a certain level of volatility where <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>some of these non-bank financial institutions will blow up</u></a>. I really think we were close to that Wednesday. I think if he had not backed off, if he had waited another day, we easily could <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>have had a firm or multiple firms blow up</u></a> and go down. And that's why <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>I brought up Lehman Brothers in one of my posts</u></a>.&nbsp; I saw it as that serious and frankly, I was trying to be one of the voices to be, like, “Hey, this is a Lehman moment. So back off and, you know, try not to blow up a number of firms.”</p><p>And I definitely think there is a level of volatility and a duration of volatility, like a set of days where, beyond that, we would see <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>multiple firms blow up</u></a>. And then there's also a question of international firms blowing up. And then of course, that brings up larger questions about the dollar. I think it'll be weeks, months, maybe even <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>years before we fully understand just how close we came</u></a>. And there's a lot of people who are keeping their cards very close to the vest because you don't want to say that your firm was, like, 24 hours from blowing up or whatever.</p><p>But I think we're going to learn more extraordinarily alarming things about last Tuesday, last Wednesday than is currently acknowledged.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>Just for time reference, April 2nd was the first big tariff announcement.</p><p>And that was a Wednesday. Weeks ago. And then basically a week after that, we were pretty close to the edge of a of a post-Lehmann style financial crisis. And then Trump announced a different set of tariffs that were actually, overall, maybe just as high, but different anyway, and were perceived as a step back from the brink.</p><p>And so you were saying that the financial system stepped back from the brink, but not that</p><p>far.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> Yeah. And volatility is still elevated. And this kind of goes back to the piece I put out the Tuesday before last, so I guess that's April 8th, which talked about the stock market.&nbsp;</p><p>These kinds of markets are <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>conventional wisdom processors</u></a>. That’s kind of a reference to Friedrich Hayek and the <a href=\"https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/37549/1/9783957961471-Markets.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com#page=41\"><u>idea of markets as an information processor</u></a>. It’s a little bit of the same thing but something different. The idea that <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>they’re conventional wisdom processors is that there's a general idea among a certain rarefied group of people</u></a> who are the most active participants in these markets and what is conventionally believed among them is really</p><p>what drives things, not access to information that any group of people have. Or a consensus among a different group of people.</p><p>The stock market would change very differently if suddenly, a week from now, all the major</p><p>stock traders were scientists. What they would price in, especially around things like climate change, would be very, very different from the current set of participants. So it's important.</p><p>The way people talk about markets is that there is an objective measure.&nbsp; That they just take information from everywhere and process them. But really, it's a specific set of people.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>As I say in that piece, you would have to have a specific mindset</u></a> and be a specific person in the world to believe that Donald Trump would be better for the stock market than Joe Biden. To believe not only that Donald Trump would be good for the stock market, that he'd be so much better than having four years of Kamala Harris or whatever, that you can track the odds of</p><p>Trump winning with the stock market going up <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>when Trump's odds of winning were going up</u></a>.</p><p>Like that's a particular kind of worldview. You know, people that we don't particularly like, people that we think were kind of nuts might have said that. And of course, not everyone on Wall Street believed that, but enough people believed it on Wall Street that it was taken as a conventional wisdom.</p><p>It's not something that you should sort of fight against when you're trading stocks and</p><p>trading in other financial markets. And that's a uniquely dangerous situation because that kind of person is the kind of person who's going to look for any off ramp, any <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>sort of little sign that things are going to be better</u></a>. And so when the stock market went up a whole bunch after Trump's announcement and volatility pared back some, it's not so much that these are more protectionist tariffs, at least as of last Wednesday—Of course, it's changed even more in the week since then. It's not like they were great, but it was just a headline in the news that would make people say, “My God, Trump is backing off. Okay, good.”</p><p>And what matters is not so much the reality of this thinking, but <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>how different factors interact</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>with each other</u></a>. And the media apparatuses present a general mood that comes from a certain perspective. It's so much that Trump needs to actually back off on tariffs or needs to be doing sane tariff policy, it just needs to be<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u> perceived as not crazy by these specific kind of idiosyncratic groups of people.</u></a></p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> Which does raise the question, if he really is going to be crazy, eventually that will filter through. So to some extent we may be getting a reprieve because the conventional wisdom is, it's really not so bad.&nbsp; But just to say, it took about two hours for people in my circle who actually were doing the tariff numbers to see that these new tariffs are basically the same overall tariff. It’s the same average tariff rate as before.</p><p>They're different, but they're just as bad. The market treated it as a major step back from the cliff. And so that was all that mattered in the moment.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> It may be motivated reasoning because of the politics, but I'm worried that there is another shoe to drop, that even now markets have not really processed just how unstable things are. Sounds like that's your sense.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> Yeah. It beggars belief that the tariff policy is not gonna pick up instability and that Trump is<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u> not gonna pick some crazy fight</u></a> where you get into this back and forth between, “is he gonna do it? Is he not gonna do it? Is he gonna do it?” So I think that kind of episode is gonna happen.</p><p>The other thing is just what we started with, the main thing that I've been focusing on, what I've been <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/can-the-trump-administration-arbitrarily-take-money-from-anyones-bank-account/\"><u>calling the Trump-Musk payments crisis</u></a>. The <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>impoundment issues and just sort of taking seizure of the federal government</u></a>. People used to talk about political risk being part of what gets priced in. Well, there's an enormous amount of political risk in the United States right now.</p><p>And then there's the further point where they’re in the process of claiming that<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u> they can take money out of anyone's bank account or freeze anyone's bank accoun</u></a>t. It's actually mind-bending trying to keep up with these stories of all the different ways that they're going after bank accounts. I mean, they froze a New York state government bank account related to EPA grants that were already handed out <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>that were being administered by Citibank</u></a>. And I want to dig into that more and write about it more. But that's just one of, I would say, four or five different payment stories that are calamitous.&nbsp;</p><p>Let alone their wanting to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-rebuild-social-security-administration-cobol-benefits/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>move social security off of COBOL, which we talked about. They want to do it within two to three months</u></a>, and they want to use AI to do it. I mean, that is an existential threat to social security existing. That’s a cockamamie plan. And I don't know what the current state of it is. I've been focusing on the financial crisis, so I need to get back into it. But I don't even know how to articulate how insane a disaster this is. And hey, there's a lot of financial risk if social security breaks and no one's getting social security checks.</p><p>And these kinds of risks are just like a dime a dozen right now, all across the</p><p>administrative state. And then there are other layers, forgetting even geopolitical things like,</p><p>are we invading Greenland? Maybe? All of these things are just so enormous.</p><p>That's why, you know, I didn't think I would succeed, but <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>why in that first week of the Trump-Musk payments crisis</u></a>, I was pretty conscious in that <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2025-02-05/bureau-of-the-fiscal-service-the-payment-system-elon-musk-has-access-to?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Odd Lots interview on Bloomberg</u></a>, to try to really hammer home just how potentially calamitous this is to the financial system and explicitly say that all these financial markets <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>should be pricing in these kind of uncertainties and they are not doing so</u></a>.</p><p>There are now questions that are burgeoning up on the dollar. I wrote a gigantic <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>monster of a piece about that</u></a> on Sunday. I'm going to be writing some more big picture things about the dollar this week, but to me, the real question of a disaster, of a crisis, is when these people who suddenly have started to lose faith in the Trump administration's economic policy, that they start looking around and looking for other eventualities. They look at other things that are threats to the dollar, and come across the<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u> panoply of things that I've been covering and put two and two together</u></a>. If this payment system goes down, the whole fiscal machinery that makes the dollar <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>the dollar is gonna collapse</u></a>.&nbsp; And then that could potentially be a<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u> second wave of the financial crisis.</u></a></p><p>But I don't know whether to put it as a bright side or a negative. And right now I'm kind of more inclined to see it as a negative but, even when something is kind of slammed in their face, like Trump's tariffs, they didn't really get the message until he had to slam their faces into the</p><p>pavement a few times.</p><p>Something like the Trump-Musk payments crisis, it's the kind of thing where,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u> as Joe Weisenthal said at the end of that interview</u></a>, financial markets will only freak out when something actually breaks. But we can't wait for something to break. That is too dangerous. That's too calamitous.</p><p>They'll show up and say, “man, this problem is so bad,” when the building's already burned</p><p>down and is in a cinder.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> Maybe we should leave it there. I need a drink.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> Well, let's get that drink.</p><p>Last thing I wanted to mention, and this is also a sign of how bad the crisis is: My lease on an office in Manhattan started yesterday, 2,000 square feet.

I also felt that that run of pieces have sufficiently prepared readers for events this week that I didn’t need to rush out a follow up piece about the dollar. However, I thought it would be a good prelude to what I want to say to share- for the first time- the written version of a talk I gave at the University of Manchester nearly seven years ago. This talk, entitled “Monetary Sovereigns, Monetary Subjects and Monetary Vassals: A Spectrum Approach to Monetary Sovereignty and Our Dollar World”, lays out the basic building blocks of how I think about the international monetary order. This talk was written for an international public law audience, but I think its core points remain accessible. In any case, it will be an important touchstone to what I have to say in today’s context. For reasons of historical accuracy, I haven’t updated this talk with my current thinking or anything I’ve changed my opinion about. Nevertheless, I think it holds up quite well. Next week I will refocus on the payments crisis, with multiple pieces about what's going on in that Arena.\n\nNotes on the Crises Document Type: Written Remarks\nMain Speaker: Nathan Tankus\nLocation: University of Manchester Law School (at the invitation of John Haskell)\nSubject: The legal foundations of Dollar Hegemony, particularly focused on the role of non-reciprocal obligations\nDate: June 6th, 2018\nYoutube Link to live talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZnEDrVfcHU\n\nHello everyone. It is an absolute pleasure to be here and to be invited to talk on such an interesting and exciting topic- well, at least to me. The classic joke about economics was made by Lyndon Baines Johnson to John Kenneth Galbraith. He said “Did it ever occur to you that making a speech on economics is just like pissing down your leg? It seems hot to you, but not to anybody else?\". There’s always a danger of that, especially with more specialized topics, but I hope that by the end of my talk you can see the importance of a legal political economy analysis of international monetary economics to the world around you.\n\nIt may not be obvious why money is important to international public law, but I think it is crucial. Most discussions of international public law have money and financial relationships as their background. Further, as I’ll discuss below, international public law structures the international currency hierarchy in all sorts of ways. On a practical level, discussions of free trade agreements and other such arrangements are always happening in the context of discussions of the “special role” of the dollar. The obvious question that emerges here is how the dollar’s special role- labeled dollar hegemony- comes about and I think the answer is in large part the history of international public law and its ongoing structuring of these relationships. My point of view here is coming from an economic- and legal- school of thought called Neochartalism. Thus I should say something about what’s relevant in this theory to discussing international monetary economics\n\nThe crucial starting focus for a Neochartalist is an inquiry into what monetary objects and/or biophysical resources are receivable in payment of non-reciprocal obligations- whether they be wergild, taxes, fines, fees or tort liabilities. Receivability is just a fancy legal term for what you can pay some obligation with. From there the viewpoint expands to formally reciprocal obligations from bridewealth and student loans to purchasing a metrocard. Most histories of money- which are usually just histories of coinage- do not have this crucial focus and thus don’t give a clear idea of how the monetary system under discussion works. In other words, a Neochartalist monetary analysis must begin with the receivability laws. While there is still a lot of history that has yet to be reassessed from a Neochartalist point of view, I have confidence in the power and importance of Neochartalism from my own explorations of the American monetary system from the 16th century to the Civil War. \n\nAfter examining receivability Neochartalists expand their focus to the process by which monetary objects are created. This is where a focus on monetary sovereignty takes place. By making its own IOUs receivable in payment of taxes and other obligations owed to the state- or “private” actors- a state can gain some degree of monetary sovereignty. The extent and power of that monetary sovereignty depends on the institutional structure of the economy and the international arrangements the state in question has entered into. At this stage it is important to note that it is receivability in general that “back” money and not any particular amount of tax revenues. Thus there is no monetary or tax constraint on the level or composition of deficit spending. The constraint is, as I said above, the institutional structure of a national economy- including its institutional arrangements with the rest of the world. What I want to focus on is the constraints that emerge in the arena of international public law.\n\nIn order to do that though, I need to make some more general points about monetary sovereignty in a globalized world. Part of what I think hobbles the discussion of monetary sovereignty is that too often monetary sovereignty is treated as an “either or” proposition. You either got it or you don’t. This is odd foremost because such a boolean point of view is becoming less and less popular about money itself. The perspective that has emerged from the last decade, including getting more popular among mainstream economists, is that treasury bonds are “safe assets” in a similar way to central bank settlement balances or physical cash, as well as bank deposits for smaller actors, and one way to talk about this is to speak of the degree of “moneyness” of different financial instruments. In short, what is changing is the treatment of money as a noun towards a point of view that treats money as an adjective. If we see moneyness as a spectrum that different financial assets fall under with some items at the top hierarchy and others closer to the bottom, why not approach monetary sovereignty the same way? A spectrum approach to monetary sovereignty also emphasizes the inherent interdependency of monetary sovereignty in a globalized world. When you take a receivability point of view in tandem with a balance sheet point of view, dollar hegemony and dollarization are one and the same thing. What I mean is that to say the U.S. has a number of corporations, countries and households who have dollar denominated debts outside of its border is to say that a number of monetary sovereigns have been curtailed in some way. This is even getting more mainstream reporting. Greg Ip at the Wall Street Journal recently reported on how the rising dollar exchange rate and rising u.s. Interest rates are squeezing a number of countries whose corporate sectors have heavy dollar denominated debt. \n\nIt is the extraordinary amount of dollar denominated debt which at once raises the monetary sovereignty of the United States above all others and pulls down the monetary sovereignty of other countries. This is what makes the U.S. the currency hegemon. Thus, anything that leads to more dollar denominated debts strengthens dollar hegemony and moves away from dollar denominated debt weakens dollar hegemony. However, it would take a truly massive structural change to the way international economics works to transform the current pattern of currency debts such that the U.S. was no longer the currency hegemon. This also means that, from a Neochartalist point of view, reserve currency status is an effect, not a cause, of dollar hegemony. Just as domestically people are willing to save in dollars even if they don’t personally have many dollar debts or even pay taxes because they know so many others accept dollars in payment, internationally countries are willing to accumulate dollars because they know dollars are internationally acceptable.\n\nTo push forward this analysis I would recommend we expand our vocabulary beyond monetary sovereignty. The first term I’d introduce, which my colleague Raúl Carrillo has emphasized recently, is the term monetary subject. Monetary subject is a way of speaking about the fact that individuals who live in a certain country that issues a certain currency and imposes all sorts of obligations onto us in that currency have a subordinate relation to that monetary sovereign. The monetary sovereign makes the money rules, we just play its game. There are also Monetary vassals, Monetary subjects to one sovereign that, with some degree of voluntarity, pledge themselves to another by taking on foreign denominated debts. This can be an importer who takes on euro denominated trade credit or a corporation seeking supposedly lower interest rates abroad. Finally, there are monetary tributaries, states who obligate themselves to another state as part of a treaty or in order to achieve an objective they think requires foreign currency. It is the monetary tributaries that are clearly the most important to understand from the point of view of international public law.\n\nAnother thing that becomes obvious when you put on this analytical lens is that imposed non-reciprocal obligations are not just a matter of monetary sovereigns and monetary subjects. History is replete with examples of States imposing obligations on each other. From the Franco-Prussian war of 1871 to the Boxer Rebellion to, most famously, World War I German reparations, imposed obligations on states have structured monetary sovereignty for potentially thousands of years. In fact, in some ways the international currency hierarchy and its interdependent nature is most obvious in the case of reparations. The losing nations are under an additional burden of a foreign currency denominated debt and the winning ones have a new international backing for their currency. Public law of course does this in less overt ways, such as the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights or TRIPS agreements. For countries that are “intellectual property poor” TRIPS imposes a non-reciprocal obligation on them, that they in turn impose on their populations, to not violate international property rights regimes. Further, to get access to those properties they most often need to pay in dollars.\n\nMeanwhile, while the monetary imposition of reparations is a historical topic of interest for understanding international currency hierarchies, monetary tributaries have not gone away. They exist to this very day. One radically under-discussed monetary tributary is the French Colonies of Africa Franc, I mean the African Financial Community Franc (I am sparing you all an american attempt at French pronunciations) i.e. the CFA Franc. Sometimes the difference between colonialism and neocolonialism is exceedingly thin. From the colonial era through the 1990s this monetary union was pegged to the Franc. It then became pegged to the Euro in the transition to the Eurozone. To this very day, the currency reserves of this monetary union are on deposit at the French Treasury. I should mention that 18 months ago a book came out in French entitled Liberate Africa from Monetary Servitude: Who Profits from the CFA Franc co-authored by Kako Nubukpo. \n\nOf course, focusing too much on a particularly glaring modern example of a monetary tributary distracts from the main issue- countries in intermediate situations where they’re not so overtly pledged to another country or region but nonetheless operate under geopolitical constraints including agreements like TRIPS. We have gotten a lot of discussion of this recently in the past few years as its increasingly recognized that a number of countries have escaped dollar denominated public debts but have corporate sectors with particularly high dollar denominated debts. This puts a lot of pressure on the balance of payments since, as economist Felipe Rezende has pointed out in the Brazilian context, large foreign denominated debts taken today are large flows of interest payments tomorrow. If you forcibly converted monetary vassals into full domestic monetary subjects by redenomination a fall in the exchange rate would reduce interest payment flows relative to foreign denominated income coming in from abroad. By this I simply mean that when the exchange rate changes and you look at everything from the domestic currency point of view, exchange rate movements have no impact on the size of Brazilian Real debts but do increase the domestic size of foreign denominated income. But redenomination or any other kind of legal change that impacts existing debts brings the threat of geopolitical censure and retaliation. After all, the degree of monetary sovereignty is related to the degree of sovereignty itself. \n\nThere are a number of different directions the lens of a “spectrum of monetary sovereignty” provides but I will focus on one I think is the most relevant to an international public law audience- financial regulation and other financial policies in the context of international agreements and geopolitical. Clearly, this point of view posits that preserving and expanding monetary sovereignty is a valid and important goal for financial regulation. What policies pursue that end? Attacking the domestic creation of foreign denominated bank deposits is key. Local deposit insurance systems can easily provide for domestic obligations but being responsible for foreign denominated obligations can cause problems. Additionally, not having domestic issuance of foreign denominated monies makes it more difficult for domestic residents to “run” from the local currency. More generally, making foreign denominated debts less domestically protected is an important avenue. On the flip side, making domestic credit more attractive is a way of “competing” with foreign debt. Felipe Rezende has written about how expansions of the Brazilian public development bank’s lending displaced some of the desire to seek dollar denominated loans. This opens the question of whether high local interest rates are really an effective way of defending the exchange rate as is commonly believed. Another strategy would be lowering the priority of foreign denominated debts in bankruptcy as well as taxing the origination of new foreign denominated obligations. The trouble as I said earlier is that the more a country attacks the legal enforcement of private foreign denominated debt, such as through lowering its priority in bankruptcy, the more it risks retaliation on the basis of political arguments over expropriation, as well as other less overtly political mechanisms.\n\nAnalyzing which strategies for defending or expanding domestic monetary sovereignty incur foreign political risks and how dangerous various different foreign reactions are is an entire area of legal political economy study of extreme importance. There is also an important fallacy of composition to avoid. While it may be the case that some developing countries can advance their monetary sovereignty sufficiently to do major political emancipatory programs, in our current geopolitical context I don’t think it's possible for all of them to do so without major political changes in the United States. Dollar hegemony is crucial to the U.S.’s role. Even if some individual suites of policies weren’t seen as a threat, the U.S. would eventually intervene to disrupt this process of independent development if it got “too far”. To see both the possibilities and limits I think Neochartalism provides the appropriate lens.\n\nThe other important arena for international public law is to examine agreements that are supposedly about “free trade” through this lens. There have already been discussions of how things like Investor State Dispute Settlement tribunals reduce sovereignty but from this point of view they also attack monetary sovereignty. As far as I’ve been able to tell, ISDS liability is all denominated in dollars. Thus from a Neochartalist point of view ISDS is a powerful tool for preserving and strengthening dollar hegemony and puts countries that otherwise have been able to avoid foreign denominated debts in compromised positions. Even if the absolute dollar amounts have not been extremely large in relation to the size of the economies under discussion, the fact that any potential policy change can possibly incur dollar denominated debts changes the policy arena markedly. On the other hand, the more governments try to resist the elements of multilateral agreements like TRIPS or free trade agreements with ISDS in order to protect and advance monetary sovereignty, the more they risk being isolated internationally which has its own economic problems- particularly around international supply chains (which I haven’t discussed much but would be happy to discuss more in the Q and A). \n\nFinally, and I really mean finally, foreign denominated trade credit and medium term sources of foreign credit may be necessary for ongoing trade relations. If that’s ultimately the case there are strong reasons to want a central clearing entity to manage these relationships and prevent the occurrence of monetary vassals. Examining the history of Regional Payments Unions and Clearinghouses from a Neochartalist point of view is key to bringing that project forward. These arrangements were and are a form of international public law but I think they have been relatively neglected as money itself has been neglected.  I’d like to end by saying that while I’ve pointed a number of areas that need more work, particularly legal work, but there has also been a lot accomplished- especially in the last decade-, and the true power of Neochartalism in my view is all the things that are ripe to be rethought in its context. Thank you.\n\n\n\n","html":"<p></p><p>Hello Readers, I have taken the last few days to rest after an intense 80 hour work week last week, having written four pieces totaling 16,000 words.

By this I simply mean that when the exchange rate changes and you look at everything from the domestic currency point of view, exchange rate movements have no impact on the size of Brazilian Real debts but do increase the domestic size of foreign denominated income. But redenomination or any other kind of legal change that impacts existing debts brings the threat of geopolitical censure and retaliation. After all, the degree of monetary sovereignty is related to the degree of sovereignty itself.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a number of different directions the lens of a “spectrum of monetary sovereignty” provides but I will focus on one I think is the most relevant to an international public law audience- financial regulation and other financial policies in the context of international agreements and geopolitical. Clearly, this point of view posits that preserving and expanding monetary sovereignty is a valid and important goal for financial regulation. What policies pursue that end? Attacking the domestic creation of foreign denominated bank deposits is key. Local deposit insurance systems can easily provide for domestic obligations but being responsible for foreign denominated obligations can cause problems. Additionally, not having domestic issuance of foreign denominated monies makes it more difficult for domestic residents to “run” from the local currency. More generally, making foreign denominated debts less domestically protected is an important avenue. On the flip side, making domestic credit more attractive is a way of “competing” with foreign debt. Felipe Rezende has written about how expansions of the Brazilian public development bank’s lending displaced some of the desire to seek dollar denominated loans. This opens the question of whether high local interest rates are really an effective way of defending the exchange rate as is commonly believed. Another strategy would be lowering the priority of foreign denominated debts in bankruptcy as well as taxing the origination of new foreign denominated obligations. The trouble as I said earlier is that the more a country attacks the legal enforcement of private foreign denominated debt, such as through lowering its priority in bankruptcy, the more it risks retaliation on the basis of political arguments over expropriation, as well as other less overtly political mechanisms.</p><p>Analyzing which strategies for defending or expanding domestic monetary sovereignty incur foreign political risks and how dangerous various different foreign reactions are is an entire area of legal political economy study of extreme importance. There is also an important fallacy of composition to avoid. While it may be the case that some developing countries can advance their monetary sovereignty sufficiently to do major political emancipatory programs, in our current geopolitical context I don’t think it's possible for all of them to do so without major political changes in the United States. Dollar hegemony is crucial to the U.S.’s role. Even if some individual suites of policies weren’t seen as a threat, the U.S. would eventually intervene to disrupt this process of independent development if it got “too far”. To see both the possibilities and limits I think Neochartalism provides the appropriate lens.</p><p>The other important arena for international public law is to examine agreements that are supposedly about “free trade” through this lens. There have already been discussions of how things like Investor State Dispute Settlement tribunals reduce sovereignty but from this point of view they also attack monetary sovereignty. As far as I’ve been able to tell, ISDS liability is all denominated in dollars. Thus from a Neochartalist point of view ISDS is a powerful tool for preserving and strengthening dollar hegemony and puts countries that otherwise have been able to avoid foreign denominated debts in compromised positions. Even if the absolute dollar amounts have not been extremely large in relation to the size of the economies under discussion, the fact that any potential policy change can possibly incur dollar denominated debts changes the policy arena markedly. On the other hand, the more governments try to resist the elements of multilateral agreements like TRIPS or free trade agreements with ISDS in order to protect and advance monetary sovereignty, the more they risk being isolated internationally which has its own economic problems- particularly around international supply chains (which I haven’t discussed much but would be happy to discuss more in the Q and A).&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, and I really mean finally, foreign denominated trade credit and medium term sources of foreign credit may be necessary for ongoing trade relations. If that’s ultimately the case there are strong reasons to want a central clearing entity to manage these relationships and prevent the occurrence of monetary vassals. Examining the history of Regional Payments Unions and Clearinghouses from a Neochartalist point of view is key to bringing that project forward. These arrangements were and are a form of international public law but I think they have been relatively neglected as money itself has been neglected.&nbsp; I’d like to end by saying that while I’ve pointed a number of areas that need more work, particularly legal work, but there has also been a lot accomplished- especially in the last decade-, and the true power of Neochartalism in my view is all the things that are ripe to be rethought in its context. Thank you.</p><p></p><p></p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/june2018manchesterspectrumofmonetarysovereignty/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"c12b6766-f392-457c-ad11-ece2229f7513","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"68011e626d03c00001f00d3f","reading_time":11}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"April 13","id":"Ghost__Post__67fba8de1f0cbc0001105ab4","title":"Is the Trump Tariff Financial Crisis A Crisis of the Dollar?

I am coming to you Sunday because, yes, I am a human and took much of the rest of the week off. I even slept at night! Three times in a row! Vanity Fair’s profile of Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway a very bad sign, and very resonant to my experience this week: “No! Sleep! For Bloomberg! How the Media Giant’s Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway Survived a Manic Week”. Well, I did take about 16 hours to write this piece, but I did it at a slower pace with lots of breaks. \n\nPart of why I didn’t feel urgency to have a piece out during the rest of the weekday was that I felt my first three pieces laid out most of the core elements of this crisis. I was confident they would serve as a good enough guide for readers regarding the rest of the week’s developments. The only missing piece was the international financial architecture part, which is the subject of today’s piece. This is certainly the most complicated part of what I have to cover and also the most opaque. In the future I will try to break down this topic even more: in part writing this piece has been an exercise in fully determining what I think by working through every logical angle I can come up with. This is the outer edge of our understanding of the global financial system. So this piece is an exercise in “digestion” and will need to be “reprocessed” for public consumption in future pieces, and by others (Hi Krugman!). Skip to the conclusion if you just want my takeaway. First though, let’s recap where we’ve been.\n\nMy opening salvo was “Trump’s “Liberation Day” and the Ongoing Stock Market Crash: The Key Lessons to Take into the Second Week of the Market Bloodbath”. I covered the basics of stock markets, that they actually close and thus the way foreign stock markets “preview” what will happen between 9:30 AM and 4:00 PM on U.S. (New York) stock exchanges. I covered the role of index providers and index funds in stock market dynamics today. I finished by covering exactly why the Trump tariffs were so disastrous and led to Covid March 2020 style supply chain paralysis. \n\nI followed up from that on Tuesday with the piece “The Stock Market is a Conventional Wisdom Processor: Why Trump’s Tariffs Crashed the Stock Market While the Trump Musk Payments Crisis Hasn’t (Yet)”. In that piece I recounted the history of the first week of the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis from the angle of my conscious attempt to get stock market participants to reprice financial markets with accurate information about the risks DOGE’s direct access to the Treasury’s internal payments system poses. Along the way I exclusively reported the quotes of two former Senior advisors to the Treasury, Chastity Murphy and Anisha Steephen, on the extraordinary alarm that former and current treasury officials felt about DOGE’s direct “read/write” access to the Treasury’s payments system. They both even confirmed the importance Notes on the Crises had among high level current and former Treasury officials to understand what was going on.\n\nMost importantly, that piece covered why I failed to crash the stock market by accurately spreading the word about the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis, and why neither Bloomberg Oddlots hosts Joe Weisenthal or Tracy Alloway, or myself thought I had much chance to succeed. The key idea is that the stock market is a “conventional wisdom processor”, while the extraordinary threat of the Treasury payments system issues were too technical to become conventional wisdom on wall street. Joe also pointed out, correctly, that stock markets have a very difficult time with risks that are so dramatic. They either don’t happen (and everything is fine!) or they do happen (and catastrophe results.) This is why the Trump Tariffs could only crash the stock market when “Liberation Day” happened. That fateful day, the “financial community” was repeatedly denied the “good news” that would allow some calm to return to financial markets.\n\nWhich leads to my third piece on Wednesday: “104% China Tariffs Came into Effect at Midnight. We Instantly Entered this Crisis’s ‘Lehman Brothers’ Moment”. Trump’s eye-popping retaliatory tariffs on China, which actually came into effect at Midnight Wednesday, instantly solidified the financial market stresses into a full blown financial crisis. It is still unclear whether this will be much bigger than Fall 2008—but signs point to yes. What is of course unique about this crisis is that it is extraordinary volatility, comparable only to the Great Financial Crisis and March 2020, derived solely from the volatile, erratic and insane decisions of one man: President Donald Trump. The rest of that piece is devoted to the financial market infrastructure, the post 2008 financial regulatory environment, and the vulnerabilities left from a “lack” of monetary design which Trump’s incredible volatility is colliding with.\n\nThe only part of the international financial infrastructure I touched on in Wednesday’s piece was a general discussion of how scary it is that in this situation it's not at all clear that the Federal Reserve would provide central bank swap lines to foreign central banks. (That's what they did in 2008 and 2020.) I said there was going to be a hunger for dollars over time, and no “running from the dollar”. We’ve clearly had some big dollar movements, but I still think that last statement is true. The former statement has shown no sign of being true yet, and there are reasons to think it is outright wrong. To understand why, we’re going to have to unpack a lot of international financial dynamics I had no time to cover (or think about) Wednesday. In many ways, this discussion will have many familiar aspects from Wednesday’s write up of hedge fund treasury securities holdings, hedged with “options”. It’s just now there’s a whole new financial derivative at the center of the story: the Foreign Exchange Swap.\n\nBefore we dive in, I want to step back and make some general points about Financial Derivatives. To do so, I will return to a piece I wrote in May 2023 called “The Utopian Vision of Financial Derivatives”. This piece is so important to understanding the topic here, that bear with me as I quote a large chunk of it:\n\nTypically, finance is seen as the height of realism, while the demands of outsiders are cast in idealist (read: ill-thought out and unrealistic) terms. However, those who truly understand finance understand that the financial system and its priests have utopias of their own, that they try to make a reality. One of the deepest and most alluring utopias in the world of finance is a world without unwanted risks and uncertainties. In this utopia, no one takes on a risk without wanting to get a higher return. And any one who chooses to take on additional risk can afford to take that loss. It’s a world where not only sufficient safe assets exist, the risk taking that does happen is contained, and does not have any systemic consequences. Macroeconomic financial instability is, in other words, contracted away.\n\nHow does this dream work? The key is financial derivatives. Through the lens of financial derivatives, no asset is unique. Rather than seeing assets as having unique risk (and uncertainty) profiles of their own, the financial market true believer sees a bundle of “risks”, which can be mixed and matched.  Have a commercial real estate loan with significant credit risk? Don’t want to take any risk? Buy a credit default swap, essentially a kind of insurance against default, and now you have an asset without bearing the risk that your debtor will default! That will be someone else’s problem if it happens.  \n\nStill feel like you are taking on too much risk? Buy interest rate swaps, essentially types of insurance against the risk interest rates will change, and now you don’t have interest rate risk! That derivatives pay out in specific circumstances make them contingent liabilities. Since every financial liability is someone else’s financial asset, this makes them contingent assets to the holders. These contingent assets are supposed to offset the contingencies in the underlying securities. The key word there is supposed to. We’ll return to this issue later.\n\nThis brings us right back to the issue of safe assets. Some readers may have predicted where this is going. In essence, this vision comes down to comparing any given asset to a treasury bill, and then thinking through all the different financial derivatives that can be bought to turn any asset into a kind of treasury bill. Mehrling, Pozsar et al. use the term “quasi-treasury bill” for this type of asset, which I think is apt. It serves the role of a safe asset, of a treasury bill, until it suddenly can’t anymore. The key thing to understand is that in the full throated version of the utopian vision described here, with sufficient financial derivatives, any financial asset can be transformed into a “synthetic” or “quasi” treasury bill. The question is just the price you are paying on those financial derivatives compared to the return the underlying asset is providing over and above the return on an actual treasury bill.\n\nThe true scope and power of this vision is easy to underestimate. Have a portfolio of long maturity risky commercial real estate loans? With interest rate swaps and credit default swaps, those are now quasi-treasury bills! In this vision, those risky commercial real estate loans are fundamentally just a treasury bill combined with interest rate risk and credit risk. This vision can be taken further, a loan to a local government in another country and another currency is just foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Buy a foreign exchange swap, an interest rate swap and a credit default swap and even that asset is now a quasi-treasury bill! This is what I mean when I say this vision is utopian. Through this lens, you can dream of a world where there’s never any shortage of safe assets whatsoever.\n\nI know that was a lot to quote, thank you for bearing with me. \n\nI promise that this is crucial to understand the international issues involved. That last paragraph particularly hits the important part: foreign institutional investors, Hedge Funds, Pension Funds and Insurance Companies among others, have obligations in their domestic currencies but want to invest globally to get higher returns without taking on exchange rate risk. They do this by entering into foreign exchange swaps. Since they are aiming for higher returns, they don’t take out interest rate swaps or credit default swaps. Indeed, many buy stocks ergo they are not constructing “quasi treasury bills”. However, a foreign hedge fund that both buys treasury securities, treasury options and forex swaps is constructing “quasi treasury bills”\n\nI will get into more detail about how these swaps work when (if…) this crisis gets less acute, but in essence what they do is let, say, a Japanese pension fund get a foreign currency for Japanese Yen (i.e. “swapping” them) and then that Japanese pension fund promises to swap “the other way” (exchange foreign currency for Japanese yen). The key is this provides some degree of exchange rate certainty (you set the future “swap” price in advance). This in essence “funds” the Japanese pension’s investments in dollar-denominated assets. In many ways, the global financial system runs on such arrangements. You can think of these as “quasi-Yen U.S. investments” in the manner of Mehrling and Poszar et al.’s “quasi-treasury bill”. \n\nThis also centers the role of the dollar on a set of financial markets and arrangements that are extremely obscure to the public i.e. not trade arrangements. Hyun Shin, the head of the “monetary and economics department” at the Bank of International Settlements, expressed the issues well in a March 2023 speech entitled “The dollar-based financial system through the window of the FX swaps market”:\n\nThe international role of the dollar is often discussed in the context of the current accounts of both advanced and emerging market economies and their accumulation of reserve assets. Several contributions in this volume reflect this focus on the current account. However, it is better to view the dollar’s outsize importance in global affairs as deriving more from its pre-eminent role as the funding currency of choice in global capital markets for banks and non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs), and the pivotal role of central bank dollar swap lines as a liquidity backstop in keeping the global financial system on an even keel\n\n[...]\n\nHowever, much more important than these “real economy” uses is the hedging by non-bank financial firms (eg pension funds and insurance companies) that manage the exchange rate risk associated with their asset portfolio. Take the case of a life insurer or pension fund who has obligations to policy holders or beneficiaries in euros, yen, sterling or Swiss francs. While these obligations are in domestic currency, the life insurer or pension fund typically holds a globally diversified portfolio, much of it comprising dollar assets. To hedge the currency risk, the life insurer or pension fund can enter an FX swap with a global bank, in effect borrowing dollars while pledging domestic currency as collateral. \n\nThe amounts involved in such hedging transactions are very large. The outstanding obligations to pay US dollars in FX swaps/forwards, mostly very short term, amount to more than $80 trillion. This sum exceeds the stocks of dollar Treasury securities, repo and commercial paper combined. Such are the outstanding stocks. In terms of flows, the latest BIS Triennial survey found that the churn of deals approached $5 trillion per day in 2022, accounting for two thirds of daily global FX turnover. [Emphasis Added, citations removed]\n\nThat was a lot and was not designed for public accessibility. Two things I’d note. First, readers should recall that “collateral” is something you pledge to get access to a loan. Creditors love to replace “collateral worthiness” for mere “credit worthiness” (read my 2020 primer on collateral here). The second thing to note is that “FX” is often used as a shorthand for “foreign exchange”. Finance has a funny evolution of shorthand. Foreign exchange became “forex” and in the acronym has become “FX”. “FE” just wouldn’t cut it. \n\nAnyway, in essence, Shin’s first two paragraphs say what I said above. That last paragraph is the crucial new bit: this is a mind-boggingly large financial market. It’s hard to even think about what 80 trillion dollars of obligation to pay U.S. dollars even means. It shouldn’t surprise us then, given the size of these numbers, that whatever is going on with the dollar is found in the “dollar swap market”.\n\nIn connection with these issues, a few anonymous sources have brought up the example of August 5th 2024, an intense but quickly forgotten burst of volatility in the foreign exchange currency and swap markets between Japan and other countries, but especially the U.S. To the people I talk to this episode provides the key model for understanding what’s going on right now. As it happens, Hyun Shin also did an excellent interview with Joe and Tracy on the Oddlots podcast on that early August 2024 hiccup last year. Bear with me as I do another extended pull quote (it's just that kind of piece):\n\nHyun: But I think it's not really enough to explain why there was this much more broad based stress, especially in the equity markets. And I think here we have to think about the broader issues to do with how risk is managed, how risk management itself, risk management in the form of loss mitigation also generates some potential for amplification that could actually make things more volatile.\n\nSo let me explain what I mean by that. So if I have a Value at Risk rule that says if my risk is triggered beyond this VaR level, then I cut my position, that means I sell, or if I'm lending, I cut my lines, etc., from the point of view of the borrower or from the point of view of the market as a whole that is something that would actually amplify whatever stress that was there in the first place.\n\nIf I'm a lender and I set margins, or if I'm a CCP — a central counterparty or an exchange — there is a margin that I ask for, the various contracts that I deal with, typically during stress periods, those margins go up. So that's a kind of de-leveraging now, the way that we deal with risk is precisely to mitigate loss. And there is a spillover effect that goes to the broader market.\n\nAnd I wonder whether we should look back on the events of early August and if you like, apply that lens to to the events back then. So if for example, I was not borrowing in and investing in technology stocks as you suggested, but it's just that within my firm there is a team that is doing a classical carry trade, but there is also a team that is leveraged the US tech stocks, but one team doesn't know what the other team is doing.\n\nSo let's say one pod doesn't know what the other pod is doing, but from the firm's point of view, it looks as if in aggregate that there is a short yen position and the long position in technology stocks. And if that risk constraint is triggered somehow it's going to have a much broader implication, much broader repercussion through all of the holdings.\n\nTracy: (18:49)\n\nThis kind of reminds me, there used to be that saying about [how] ‘In a crisis, you sell what you can,’ not necessarily what's most impacted. So it might be that the most volatility is falling in the currency market and in the carry trade, but the thing that you're selling to reduce your risk exposure is something totally different just because you can, or because it's easier to do in an extremely volatile environment.\n\nHyun: (19:15)\n\nAnd if you like, it's the risk limits that are triggered. And the way that risk limits work is if the aggregate portfolio is suffering losses, then the risk limits are tightened for all the different assets that you own. And I think something that we need to think about in terms of how we can mitigate some of these issues. [emphasis added]\n\nAll of this should be, in some sense, familiar from Wednesday’s piece. You have forced deleveraging leading to selling off of the “least affected” assets in the scramble for “cash” to pay down debts and meet other kinds of obligations. This “scramble for cash” and push to deleverage is fundamentally driven by the explosion of “risk” as measured by Value at Risk (VaR) models. Thus, underneath all the complication is just the international version of domestic hedge fund deleveraging. However we can’t stop at this point. Because the “international deleveraging” is running through the foreign exchange swap market and almost the entirety of global currency trading (by volume) runs through the swap markets connecting Europe, major countries in Asia and the United States. \n\nIndeed, most foreign exchange swaps are dollar exchange rate swaps. As of June 2024, the total outstanding foreign exchange swaps according to Bank of International Settlements data was worth 113 trillion. When you exclude dealers, i.e. focus just on their “financial” and “non-financial” customers, that amount becomes roughly 73 trillion. The following graph (graph sources here) shows roughly 63 trillion of that involve dollars. If this is roughly correct, then more than 80% of outstanding customer foreign exchange swaps as of June 2024 were dollar swaps. Add in the dealers and we reach some truly astounding figures, both in percentage terms and in absolute dollar amounts. \n\nIn June 2024 outstanding fx dollar obligations was a truly astounding 99 trillion dollars. 99 trillion divided by 113 trillion outstanding means that over 87% of outstanding forex swaps in the world involved dollars. We are so, so, so, so far from the demise of the dollar.\n\nOkay, the dollar is the core of this system, yet the dollar’s exchange rate fell? How are we to understand this? Hyun Shin’s argument in his March 2023 speech about the vulnerability of non-U.S. “advanced” economies to dollar liquidity needs was based on the presumption that foreign institutional investors would fight to maintain their institutional investments, and would only liquidate them in extreme scenarios that correlated with a deep global shortage of “dollar finance”. It is in these circumstances that swap lines with the Federal Reserve become important. That's why it was so concerning that all the moves suggested that swap lines either wouldn’t be used, or the Treasury would step in to force the Federal Reserve to terminate its swap line arrangements. This was my state of thinking as of Wednesday morning, while also knowing that foreign entities may be selling treasuries to cover liquidity strains and deal with their own risk model blowouts. So I knew that that was going on in addition to the domestic stress-based sell offs.\n\nWhat has emerged since then is that the Trump Tariff Financial Crisis may have been extreme enough to get at least some foreign institutional investors to liquidate their holdings of U.S. dollar assets in order to deleverage. Thus dollar liquidity issues have not become extreme enough to require activating swap lines (i.e. lending dollars from the Federal Reserve to foreign central banks) because, when faced with increased difficulty and cost to holding U.S. dollar assets, some amount of foreign institutional investors would rather sell dollar assets and shrink their balance sheet. Let me be clear here, there are no clear signs of divestment from (non-Chinese) foreign pension funds, insurance companies etc. These discussions have started to happen, but actions have not (at least as far as can be divined). The extent to which there has been sell offs and deleveraging seems concentrated among hedge funds or other similarly situated non-bank financial institutions.\n\nAnyway, remember Fonzie from my last piece? Well, here's a simplified way of thinking about what deleveraging looks like across borders, across currencies and with foreign exchange swaps. Let’s check out what’s going on with “Fonzie in Japan”. Readers should keep in mind I’m skipping over, and simplifying, important accounting issues with Foreign Exchange swaps to convey the core dynamic.\n\nWhat is going on here is that, as the cost of financing what amounts to insurance protection against dollar exchange rate movements rises, and the general volatility of U.S. markets blows out internal risk models, the obvious takeaway is these positions are not worth the cost and to close them out. This seems to be happening on a large scale, which explains why the dollar exchange rate has sharply moved down amidst macroeconomic news that are conventionally associated with the dollar going up. This is precisely the kind of development which rips up “quasi-treasury bills” and “quasi-Yen U.S. investments”. To understand why, I have to briefly return to my “The Utopian Vision of Financial Derivatives”:\n\nIn essence, what they [Mehrling, Poszar et al.] are saying is that the critical problem with “quasi-treasury bills” is that you can use financial derivatives for a lot of things, but you can’t use them to insure yourself against a lack of liquidity. I.e. the risk that the asset will not be saleable (either outright or as collateral for a loan which assigns a favorable “collateral price” to the asset) when you truly need to meet payment outflows. There is no private market for “liquidity swaps” and, even if there were, how could the liquidity of the liquidity swap market be guaranteed? \n\n[...]\n\nRecall that the most essential thing that financial derivatives are supposed to do in this “extreme” example is preserve the security holder’s principal. In other words, a “quasi treasury bill” functions like a real treasury bill when the value of the security combined with the value of the swaps stays the same. This means that when the actual underlying security takes a loss (either in market valuation or through a “credit event” i.e. default), the swaps rise in value by an equal amount.\n\nAs discussed earlier, while the model valuation of the swap may rise because e.g. interest rates actually rose, there is no guarantee that the market value of the swap will fully rise to offset the loss on the underlying security. Put simply, liquidity in the swap market is by no means guaranteed. However, this is not the worst of it. Even if the market value of the swap rises “fully”, it doesn’t necessarily facilitate making payments.\n\nGo back to my last piece for a basic discussion of liquidity. In the context of current events, a rise in the value of a dollar swap is supposed to offset a decline in the exchange rate of the dollar against the Yen. This is supposed to preserve the “principal” or the “acquisition price” of this “quasi-Yen U.S. investment”. If illiquidity and volatility in the swap market prevents that from happening, those foreign hedge funds will struggle to hold onto those dollar assets. This is especially the case because of the terms of those FX swaps.\n\nRecall that FX swaps have collateral- the currency you “swapped” up front! They also have terms. Movements in exchange rates don’t affect the prices of the future “swap” i.e. repayment. But they can affect collateral terms. It is convention in this newsletter to refer to the valuation of collateral as the “collateral price”. You can “sell” assets for their “market price” or their “collateral price”. Instability often emerges when “market prices” have an immediate and direct impact on “collateral prices” (I wrote about this at length in the Eurozone context in May 2020). It is typical in the world of FX swaps to require additional collateral based on movements in some other underlying market. In essence, the terms of the dollar swap requires a certain “price” to be paid, and the terms allow for the “devaluation” of the current collateral and subsequently the sudden obligation to provide “more collateral”.\n\nMeanwhile, even without the collateral issues the “maturity length” or time before a swap is “closed out” is far smaller than the “maturity length” of the asset holdings those fx swaps are partly financing. In other words, they are using dollar swaps to finance holdings of assets with much longer maturities. This is the meaning behind “shadow banking” (which you can read much more about in my 2023 piece on Zoltan Pozsar and his early 2010s work.) To be “maturity matched” they would have to find lenders willing to provide forex swaps of 5 years, 10 years or more. Which brings me back, yet again, to my “Utopian Vision” piece:\n\nIn practice, even if you pursue the production of “quasi-treasury bills”, there are all sorts of mismatches (large or small) that you take on in order to roughly get the safety you are looking for. And that works… until it doesn’t. Complete and perfect collateral “matched book” trading rarely occurs. What gets called “matched book” in practice involves “significant amounts of maturity, credit, and collateral transformation, exposing them to interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk”. In other words, mismatches. [Emphasis added]\n\nIssuing an obligation with “fragile” moneyness to finance asset holdings that you intend to hold far longer than the maturity date of those “shadow monies” works as long as that fragile moneyness holds up. FX swaps have been one of those shadow monies, and the sudden liquidation of large amounts of them may not literally be a “shadow money run” in the sense that people doubt counterparties holding up to FX swap terms. But nevertheless, the financial stress of this financial crisis is leading to those positions being liquidated. As we’ve discussed, deleveraging one place creates pressures for deleveraging across what we might call the “financial supply chain”.\n\nWhich brings us to the foreign exchange market itself. Lets say you google two currency pairs, like the United States Dollar (USD) and the Japanese Yen (JPY), along with the phrase “exchange rate”. The graph that will be staring back at you will be the exchange rate that emerges from the current buying and selling of Dollars and Yen. Much of the current talk of Dollar collapse, besides movements in the Treasury market, is the movement of the dollar against other currencies. This is based on the presumption that these markets are deep and liquid. That presumption was only valid (and not fully valid) in a world before the global regulatory reforms coming out of the Great Financial Crisis. If that presumption isn’t correct, then judgments based on spot dollar exchange rates will be mistaken. \n\nOn Thursday “Risk.Net” ran a headline “FX liquidity ‘worse than Covid’ amid tariff volatility, dealers say”. There’s plenty of dense detail in this article, but the takeaway is that “intraday” (within one single day) volatility in the foreign exchange market went up “more than five fold” this week because of Trump’s Tariff announcements. This makes sense because the spot foreign exchange market is not separate from the foreign exchange swap market. They are connected because an implicit exchange rate can be derived from how dollar swaps are trading. So when liquidity goes down in the dollar swap market, that “spills over” onto the smaller spot market.\n\nMeanwhile, liquidity goes down when volatility goes up a lot and institutions, particularly large banks, pull away from the dollar swap market. Basically, the same thing that operates domestically also applies to the foreign exchange market. Liquidity constraints from both new liquidity requirements and new capital requirements lead the foreign exchange “dealing desks” at these major bank-holding companies to shrink their activities when these constraints start to “bind”. So the same VaR blowouts we talked about Wednesday do not just lead to pressure to sell assets, they also directly drain liquidity from the currency markets. It is truly astounding to get a handle on all the knock on implications from Donald Trump’s volatility.\n\nThis drain of liquidity is no idle matter. It is even key to the exchange rate dynamics between Europe and Japan. Roughly 18 months ago the Bank of International Settlements put out some absolutely essential research on the key role the largest U.S. banks play in the global forex swap market . As an aside, there’s a reason that I keep on bringing up the BIS so much. They are the core institution which takes these international financial architecture issues seriously and produces relevant and heavily empirical research on these topics. There’s a reason many people at the margins of economics have gravitated to the BIS of all the major official institutions.\n\nAnyway, the key point from that research is:\n\nUS banks stand out as pivotal FX swap intermediaries. In particular, Japanese banks that swap out of yen and into euros, and euro area banks swapping in the other direction, both transact via the US dollar mainly with US banks rather than with each other. [Emphasis added]\n\nIn other words, not only do European Banks and Japanese banks engage in dollar swaps to provide their customers with dollars, they even enter dollar swaps to acquire Yen or Euros. If this is truly the end of the dollar, Europe and Japan better get on building a much bigger and more reliable EUR/JPN swap market. That they rely on the U.S. for even this is a sign of how far we have to go before the “end of the dollar” talk becomes even a “concept of a plan”.\n\nWhich brings me to my final quote from Hyun Shin, this one from the Bloomberg Odd Lots interview about the August 2024 financial stress episode quoted thousands of words ago:\n\nThis is why during financial stress periods these FX swap bases spike, and then there has to be central bank swap lines to quell [them], etc. But there's nothing in principle that says it always has to go towards a dollar, right? If your intention is to engage in a yen carry trade, but through using FX swaps you could borrow yen and then acquire that yen obligation by going through the swap.\n\nAnd so one telltale sign is what happened to the FX swap basis during this recent episode. And in fact one of the interesting findings is that the dollar FX basis versus the yen hardly budged. It's actually a very small movement which is very atypical of a financial stress event.\n\nTo spell out what Hyun is saying: if institutions which are deleveraging are not all foreign institutions indebted in dollars but, instead, more and more U.S. institutions are, in effect, borrowing yen and euros to invest elsewhere- this could explain why exchange rate illiquidity is not leading to a (current) hunger for dollars and not leading to the kind of forex swap pricing (read distance between “bidding” and “asking” prices i.e. spreads)  we typically associate with financial stress. In these circumstances the latest quote on dollar exchange rates are a lot less important than the degree of volatility in the foreign exchange markets themselves. Meanwhile the volatility of  the “Chicago Board Option Exchange Volatility Index”, discussed in Wednesday’s piece, is a sufficient shorthand guide.\n\nThe conclusion of all this is that the dollar’s movements recently are not a dollar crisis in the sense of a collapse of the dollar. Instead they are a “dollar fx swap crisis”, whose magnitude or duration is impossible to say. It could end up being an episode like August of last year… but that’s quite unlikely. The questions about the dollar are longer term, though the dysfunction of the international financial architecture itself has solidified doubts which should be entering people’s minds for other reasons. In particular, the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis. But examining the future of the dollar of that lens will have to wait for another piece. This piece is already **checks word count. Eyebrows raise. Sympathy escalates** a horrific 5700 words or so. My apologies readers! I wrote this at the minimum level of complexity I could muster. It's just the most complex financial issue out there. It's a very bad sign you even desire to wrap your head around it.","html":"<p></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/support\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Tip!</a></div><p>For those just tuning in: I wrote a piece a day for the first three days of this week on what we should probably now term the “Trump Tariff Financial Crisis”. I am coming to you Sunday because, yes, I am a human and took much of the rest of the week off. I even slept at night! Three times in a row! Vanity Fair’s profile of Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway a very bad sign, and very resonant to my experience this week: <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/bloomberg-joe-weisenthal-tracy-alloway-manic-week-tariffs?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“No! Sleep! For Bloomberg! How the Media Giant’s Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway Survived a Manic Week”</u></a>. Well, I did take about 16 hours to write this piece, but I did it at a slower pace with lots of breaks.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of why I didn’t feel urgency to have a piece out during the rest of the weekday was that I felt my first three pieces laid out most of the core elements of this crisis. I was confident they would serve as a good enough guide for readers regarding the rest of the week’s developments. The only missing piece was the international financial architecture part, which is the subject of today’s piece. This is certainly the most complicated part of what I have to cover and also the most opaque. In the future <strong>I will try to break down this topic even more</strong>:<strong> </strong>in part writing this piece has been an exercise in fully determining what I think by working through every logical angle I can come up with. This is the <strong>outer edge</strong> of our understanding of the global financial system. So this piece is an exercise in “digestion” and will need to be “reprocessed” for public consumption in future pieces, and by others (<a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/trump-is-stupid-erratic-and-weak?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Hi Krugman!</u></a>). Skip to the conclusion if you just want my takeaway. First though, let’s recap where we’ve been.</p><p>My opening salvo was <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/trumps-liberation-day-and-the-ongoing-stock-market-crash/\"><u>“Trump’s “Liberation Day” and the Ongoing Stock Market Crash: The Key Lessons to Take into the Second Week of the Market Bloodbath”</u></a>. I covered the basics of stock markets, that they actually close and thus the way foreign stock markets “preview” what will happen between 9:30 AM and 4:00 PM on U.S. (New York) stock exchanges. I covered the role of index providers and index funds in stock market dynamics today. I finished by covering exactly why the Trump tariffs were so disastrous and led to Covid March 2020 style supply chain paralysis.&nbsp;</p><p>I followed up from that on Tuesday with the piece <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>“The Stock Market is a Conventional Wisdom Processor: Why Trump’s Tariffs Crashed the Stock Market While the Trump Musk Payments Crisis Hasn’t (Yet)”</u></a>. In that piece I recounted the history of the first week of the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis from the angle of my conscious attempt to get stock market participants to reprice financial markets with accurate information about the risks DOGE’s direct access to the Treasury’s internal payments system poses. Along the way I <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>exclusively reported the quotes of two former Senior advisors to the Treasury, Chastity Murphy and Anisha Steephen</u></a>, on the extraordinary alarm that former and current treasury officials felt about DOGE’s <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/treasury-secretary-bessents-lawlessness-sorry-readers-read-and-write-code-still-seems-in-play/\"><u>direct “read/write” access</u></a> to the Treasury’s payments system. They both even confirmed the importance <em>Notes on the Crises</em> had among high level current and former Treasury officials to understand what was going on.</p><p>Most importantly, that piece covered why I failed to crash the stock market by accurately spreading the word about the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis, and <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>why neither Bloomberg Oddlots hosts Joe Weisenthal or Tracy Alloway, or myself thought</u></a> I had much chance to succeed. The key idea is that the stock market is a “conventional wisdom processor”, while the extraordinary threat of the Treasury payments system issues were too technical to become conventional wisdom on wall street. Joe also pointed out, correctly, that stock markets have a very difficult time with risks that are so dramatic. They either don’t happen (and everything is fine!) or they do happen (and catastrophe results.) This is why the Trump Tariffs could only crash the stock market when “Liberation Day” happened. That fateful day, the “financial community” was repeatedly denied the “good news” that would allow some calm to return to financial markets.</p><p>Which leads to my third piece on Wednesday: <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>“104% China Tariffs Came into Effect at Midnight. We Instantly Entered this Crisis’s ‘Lehman Brothers’ Moment”</u></a>. Trump’s eye-popping retaliatory tariffs on China, which actually came into effect at Midnight Wednesday, instantly solidified the financial market stresses into a full blown financial crisis. It is still unclear whether this will be much bigger than Fall 2008—but signs point to yes. What is of course unique about this crisis is that it is extraordinary volatility, comparable only to the Great Financial Crisis and March 2020, derived solely from the volatile, erratic and insane decisions of one man: President Donald Trump. The rest of that piece is devoted to the financial market infrastructure, the post 2008 financial regulatory environment, and the vulnerabilities left from a “lack” of monetary design which Trump’s incredible volatility is colliding with.</p><p>The only part of the international financial infrastructure I touched on in Wednesday’s piece was a general discussion of how scary it is that in this situation it's not at all clear that the Federal Reserve would provide central bank swap lines to foreign central banks. (That's what they did in 2008 and 2020.) I said there was going to be a hunger for dollars over time, and no “running from the dollar”. We’ve clearly had some big dollar movements, <strong>but I still think that last statement is true</strong>. The former statement has shown no sign of being true yet,<strong> and there are reasons to think it is outright wrong</strong>. To understand why, we’re going to have to unpack a lot of international financial dynamics I had no time to cover (or think about) Wednesday. In many ways, this discussion will have many familiar aspects from Wednesday’s write up of hedge fund treasury securities holdings, hedged with “options”. It’s just now there’s a whole new financial derivative at the center of the story: the <strong>Foreign Exchange Swap</strong>.</p><p>Before we dive in, I want to step back and make some general points about Financial Derivatives. To do so, I will return to a piece I wrote in May 2023 called <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>“The Utopian Vision of Financial Derivatives”</u></a>. This piece is so important to understanding the topic here, that bear with me as I quote a large chunk of it:</p><blockquote>Typically, finance is seen as the height of realism, while the demands of outsiders are cast in idealist (read: ill-thought out and unrealistic) terms. However, those who truly understand finance understand that<strong> the financial system and its priests have utopias of their own, that they try to make a reality</strong>. One of the deepest and most alluring utopias in the world of finance is a world without unwanted risks and uncertainties. In this utopia, no one takes on a risk without wanting to get a higher return. And any one who chooses to take on additional risk can afford to take that loss. It’s a world where not only sufficient safe assets exist, the risk taking that does happen is contained, and does not have any systemic consequences. <strong>Macroeconomic financial instability is, in other words, contracted away.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>How does this dream work? The key is financial derivatives. Through the lens of financial derivatives, no asset is unique. Rather than seeing assets as having unique risk (and uncertainty) profiles of their own, the financial market true believer sees a bundle of “risks”, which can be mixed and matched.&nbsp; Have a commercial real estate loan with significant credit risk? Don’t want to take any risk? Buy a <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1806b.htm?ref=crisesnotes.com\">credit default swap</a>, essentially a kind of insurance against default, and now you have an asset without bearing the risk that your debtor will default! That will be someone else’s problem if it happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Still feel like you are taking on too much risk? Buy interest rate swaps, essentially types of insurance against the risk interest rates will change, and now you don’t have interest rate risk! That derivatives pay out in specific circumstances make them contingent liabilities. Since every financial liability is someone else’s financial asset, this makes them contingent assets to the holders. These contingent assets are supposed to offset the contingencies in the underlying securities.<strong> The key word there is supposed to.</strong> We’ll return to this issue later.</blockquote><blockquote>This brings us right back to the issue of safe assets. Some readers may have predicted where this is going. In essence, this vision comes down to comparing <strong>any given asset to a treasury bill, and then thinking through all the different financial derivatives that can be bought to turn any asset into a kind of treasury bill</strong>. Mehrling, Pozsar et al. use the <strong>term “quasi-treasury bill” for this type of asset</strong>, which I think is apt. It serves the role of a safe asset, of a treasury bill, <strong>until it suddenly can’t anymore</strong>. The key thing to understand is that in the full throated version of the utopian vision described here, with sufficient financial derivatives,<strong> any financial asset can be transformed into a “synthetic” or “quasi” treasury bill. The question is just the price you are paying </strong>on those financial derivatives compared to the return the underlying asset is providing over and above the return on an actual treasury bill.</blockquote><blockquote>The true scope and power of this vision is easy to underestimate. Have a portfolio of long maturity risky commercial real estate loans? With interest rate swaps and credit default swaps, those are now quasi-treasury bills! In this vision, those risky commercial real estate loans are fundamentally just a treasury bill combined with interest rate risk and credit risk. <strong>This vision can be taken further, a loan to a local government in another country and another currency is just foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Buy a foreign exchange swap, an interest rate swap and a credit default swap and even that asset is now a quasi-treasury bill! </strong>This is what I mean when I say this vision is utopian. Through this lens, <strong>you can dream of a world where there’s never any shortage of safe assets whatsoever.</strong></blockquote><p>I know that was a lot to quote, thank you for bearing with me.&nbsp;</p><p>I promise that this is crucial to understand the international issues involved. That last paragraph particularly hits the important part: foreign institutional investors, Hedge Funds, Pension Funds and Insurance Companies among others, <strong>have obligations in their domestic currencies but want to invest globally to get higher returns without taking on exchange rate risk</strong>. They do this by entering into foreign exchange swaps. Since they are aiming for higher returns, they don’t take out interest rate swaps or credit default swaps. Indeed, many buy stocks ergo they are not constructing “quasi treasury bills”. However, a foreign hedge fund that both buys treasury securities, treasury options and forex swaps <strong>is constructing “quasi treasury bills”</strong></p><p>I will get into more detail about how these swaps work when (if…) this crisis gets less acute, but in essence what they do is let, say, a Japanese pension fund get a foreign currency for Japanese Yen (i.e. “swapping” them) and then that Japanese pension fund promises to swap “the other way” (exchange foreign currency for Japanese yen). The key is this provides some degree of exchange rate certainty (you set the future “swap” price in advance). This in essence “funds” the Japanese pension’s investments in dollar-denominated assets. In many ways, the global financial system runs on such arrangements. You can think of these as<strong> “quasi-Yen U.S. investments” in the manner of Mehrling and Poszar et al.’s “quasi-treasury bill”.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This also centers the role of the dollar on a set of financial markets and arrangements that are <strong>extremely obscure to the public</strong> i.e. not trade arrangements. Hyun Shin, the head of the “monetary and economics department” at the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-first-cause-of-stability-of-our-currency-is-the-concentration-camp-central-banker-solidarity-on-the-road-to-hitlers-czechoslovakian-gold/\"><u>Bank of International Settlements</u></a>, expressed the issues well in a March 2023 speech entitled <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp230324a.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“The dollar-based financial system through the window of the FX swaps market”</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The international role of the dollar is often discussed in the <strong>context of the current accounts of both advanced and emerging market economies and their accumulation of reserve assets</strong>. Several contributions in this volume reflect this focus on the current account. <strong>However, it is better to view the dollar’s outsize importance in global affairs as deriving more from its pre-eminent role as the funding currency of choice in global capital markets for banks and non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs), and the pivotal role of central bank dollar swap lines as a liquidity backstop in keeping the global financial system on an even keel</strong></blockquote><blockquote>[...]</blockquote><blockquote>However, much more important than these “real economy” uses is <strong>the hedging by non-bank financial firms (eg pension funds and insurance companies) that manage the exchange rate risk associated with their asset portfolio. </strong>Take the case of a life insurer or pension fund who has obligations to policy holders or beneficiaries in euros, yen, sterling or Swiss francs. While these obligations are in domestic currency, the life insurer or pension fund typically holds <strong>a globally diversified portfolio, much of it comprising dollar assets</strong>. To <strong>hedge the currency risk</strong>, the life insurer or pension fund can enter a<strong>n FX swap with a global bank, in effect borrowing dollars while pledging domestic currency as collateral.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote>The amounts involved in such hedging transactions are very larg<strong>e. The outstanding obligations to pay US dollars in FX swaps/forwards, mostly very short term, amount to more than $80 trillion</strong>. This sum exceeds the stocks of dollar Treasury securities, repo and commercial paper combined. Such are the outstanding stocks. In terms of flows, the latest BIS Triennial survey found that <strong>the churn of deals approached $5 trillion per day in 2022, accounting for two thirds of daily global FX turnover.</strong> [Emphasis Added, citations removed]</blockquote><p>That was a lot and was not designed for public accessibility. Two things I’d note. First, readers should recall that “collateral” is something you pledge to get access to a loan. Creditors love to replace “collateral worthiness” for mere “credit worthiness” (read my 2020 <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/central-bank-collateral-policy-monetarypolicy101/\"><u>primer on collateral here</u></a>). The second thing to note is that “FX” is often used as a shorthand for “foreign exchange”. Finance has a funny evolution of shorthand. Foreign exchange became “forex” and in the acronym has become “FX”. “FE” just wouldn’t cut it.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, in essence, Shin’s first two paragraphs say what I said above. That last paragraph is the crucial new bit: this is a mind-boggingly large financial market. It’s hard to even think about what <strong>80 trillion dollars </strong>of obligation to pay U.S. dollars even means. It shouldn’t surprise us then, given the size of these numbers, that whatever is going on with the dollar is found in the “dollar swap market”.</p><p>In connection with these issues, a few anonymous sources have brought up the example of August 5th 2024, an intense but quickly forgotten burst of volatility in the foreign exchange currency and swap markets between Japan and other countries, but especially the U.S. To the people I talk to this episode provides the key model for understanding what’s going on right now. As it happens, Hyun Shin <strong>also </strong>did an excellent interview with Joe and Tracy on the Oddlots <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-29/hyun-song-shin-on-what-we-just-learned-from-the-yen-carry-trade-blowup?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>podcast on that early August 2024 hiccup</u></a> last year. Bear with me as I do another extended pull quote (it's just that kind of piece):</p><blockquote><strong>Hyun:</strong> But I think it's not really enough to explain why there was this much more broad based stress, especially in the equity markets. And I think here we have to think about the broader issues to do with how risk is managed, how risk management itself, risk management in the form of loss mitigation also generates some potential for amplification that could actually make things more volatile.</blockquote><blockquote>So let me explain what I mean by that.<strong> So if I have a Value at Risk rule that says if my risk is triggered beyond this VaR level, then I cut my position, that means I sell, or if I'm lending, I cut my lines, etc., from the point of view of the borrower or from the point of view of the market as a whole that is something that would actually amplify whatever stress that was there in the first place.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>If I'm a lender and I set margins, or if I'm a CCP — a central counterparty or an exchange — there is a margin that I ask for, the various contracts that I deal with, typically during stress periods, those margins go up. <strong>So that's a kind of de-leveraging now, the way that we deal with risk is precisely to mitigate loss. And there is a spillover effect that goes to the broader market.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>And I wonder whether we should look back on the events of early August and if you like, apply that lens to to the events back then. So if for example, I was not borrowing in and investing in technology stocks as you suggested, but it's just that within my firm there is a team that is doing a classical carry trade, but there is also a team that is leveraged the US tech stocks, but one team doesn't know what the other team is doing.</blockquote><blockquote>So let's say one pod doesn't know what the other pod is doing, but <strong>from the firm's point of view, it looks as if in aggregate that there is a short yen position and the long position in technology stocks. And if that risk constraint is triggered somehow it's going to have a much broader implication, much broader repercussion through all of the holdings.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong><u>Tracy: </u>(18:49)</strong></blockquote><blockquote>This kind of reminds me, there used to be that saying about [how] <strong>‘In a crisis, you sell what you can,’ not necessarily what's most impacted</strong>. So it might be that the most volatility is falling in the currency market and in the carry trade, but <strong>the thing that you're selling to reduce your risk exposure is something totally different just because you can, or because it's easier to do in an extremely volatile environment.</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong><u>Hyun:</u> (19:15)</strong></blockquote><blockquote>And if you like, it's <strong>the risk limits that are triggered</strong>. And the way that risk limits work is if the <strong>aggregate portfolio is suffering losses</strong>, then the risk limits are<strong> tightened for all the different assets that you own</strong>. And I think something that we need to think about in terms of how we can mitigate some of these issues. [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>All of this should be, in some sense, familiar from Wednesday’s piece. You have forced deleveraging leading to selling off of the “least affected” assets in the scramble for “cash” to pay down debts and meet other kinds of obligations. This “scramble for cash” and push to deleverage is fundamentally driven by the explosion of “risk” as measured by Value at Risk (VaR) models. Thus, underneath all the complication <strong>is just the international version of domestic hedge fund deleveraging</strong>. However we can’t stop at this point.

We are so, so, so, so far from the demise of the dollar.</p><p>Okay, the dollar is the core of this system, yet the dollar’s exchange rate fell? How are we to understand this? Hyun Shin’s argument in his March 2023 speech about the vulnerability of non-U.S. “advanced” economies to dollar liquidity needs was based on the presumption that foreign institutional investors would fight to maintain their institutional investments, and would only liquidate them in extreme scenarios that correlated with a deep global shortage of “dollar finance”. It is in these circumstances that swap lines with the Federal Reserve become important. That's why it was so concerning that all the moves suggested that swap lines either wouldn’t be used, or the Treasury would step in to force the Federal Reserve to terminate its swap line arrangements. This was my state of thinking as of Wednesday morning, while also knowing that foreign entities may be selling treasuries to cover liquidity strains and deal with their own risk model blowouts. So I knew that that was going on in addition to the domestic stress-based sell offs.</p><p>What has emerged since then is that the Trump Tariff Financial Crisis may have been extreme enough to get at least some foreign institutional investors to liquidate their holdings of U.S. dollar assets in order to deleverage. Thus dollar liquidity issues have not become extreme enough to require activating swap lines (i.e. lending dollars from the Federal Reserve to foreign central banks) because, when faced with increased difficulty and cost to holding U.S. dollar assets, some amount of foreign institutional investors would rather sell dollar assets and shrink their balance sheet. Let me be clear here, there are <strong>no clear signs</strong> <strong>of divestment from (</strong><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-central-bank-asks-state-lenders-reduce-dollar-purchases-sources-say-2025-04-09/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><strong><u>non-Chinese</u></strong></a><strong>) foreign pension funds, insurance companies etc</strong>. These discussions have started to happen, but <strong>actions have not</strong> (at least as far as can be divined). The extent to which there has been sell offs and deleveraging seems concentrated among hedge funds or other similarly situated non-bank financial institutions.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe1W2RBPVKPzk-YXK1Zt9Ji0BDOHrxOmxiAJ5KsBD-Y9Na1KDOWPTt2PITWItFueiNlqZX-Fbnzwjpycaid3qfrcw0amjO3lEx7bhXuQ1Qx5bn1-xJMbSmD5zoxR3qtUUv1YH6IFA?key=1TU-2PgUXYGxNngenNOABy7Q\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"188\" height=\"413\"></figure><p>Anyway, remember <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>Fonzie from my last piece?</u></a> Well, here's a simplified way of thinking about what deleveraging looks like across borders, across currencies and with foreign exchange swaps. Let’s check out what’s going on with “Fonzie in Japan”. Readers should keep in mind I’m skipping over, and simplifying, important accounting issues with Foreign Exchange swaps to convey the core dynamic.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdh9MhZzvQzGrcN7oALs5SlEGs8kQfVs_Igh8igu1KceKG9eE7rrDzax-DslCMkJgmnThLKNzTDtyZQuhs7nsWD2pgHJLm7QGy9wUMrVRBZBb9ZrK3qQeb04FBKMiLPaOGRc1qmow?key=1TU-2PgUXYGxNngenNOABy7Q\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"283\" height=\"498\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXesDHZgKgHMkQGe8qo9tz50RHhbpHJNzA5uAnCZLBEKCHZxzlbxSYpJH2AKv2SYJYtKjtB91SPfT7pL_cVxJYc5TNtVF9VTJ-O9UooYsbtAokO_BuJZjjT61ApTzEQHdQjahTI0KQ?key=1TU-2PgUXYGxNngenNOABy7Q\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"279\" height=\"477\"></figure><p>What is going on here is that, as the cost of financing what amounts to insurance protection against dollar exchange rate movements rises, and the general volatility of U.S. markets blows out internal risk models, the obvious takeaway is these positions are not worth the cost and to close them out. This seems to be happening on a large scale, which explains why the dollar exchange rate has sharply moved down amidst macroeconomic news that are conventionally associated with the dollar going up. This is precisely the kind of development which rips up “quasi-treasury bills” and <strong>“quasi-Yen U.S. investments”. </strong>To understand why, I have to briefly return to my <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>“The Utopian Vision of Financial Derivatives”</u></a>:</p><blockquote>In essence, what they [Mehrling, Poszar et al.] are saying is that the critical problem with “quasi-treasury bills” is that you can use financial derivatives for a lot of things, <strong>but you can’t use them to insure yourself against a lack of liquidity</strong>.<strong> I.e. the risk that the asset will not be saleable (either outright or as collateral for a loan which assigns a favorable “collateral price” to the asset)</strong> when you truly need to meet payment outflows. There is no private market for “liquidity swaps” and, even if there were,<strong> how could the liquidity of the liquidity swap market be guaranteed?&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><blockquote>[...]</blockquote><blockquote>Recall that the most essential thing that financial derivatives are supposed to do in this “extreme” example is preserve the security holder’s principal. In other words, <strong>a “quasi treasury bill” functions like a real treasury bill when the value of the security combined with the value of the swaps stays the same</strong>. This means that when the actual underlying security takes a loss (either in market valuation or through a “credit event” i.e. default),<strong> the swaps rise in value by an equal amount.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>As discussed earlier, while the model valuation of the swap may rise because e.g. interest rates actually rose, there is no guarantee<strong> that the market value of the swap will fully rise to offset the loss on the underlying security.</strong> Put simply, liquidity in the swap market is by no means guaranteed. However, this is not the worst of it. Even if the market value of the swap rises “fully”, it doesn’t necessarily<strong> facilitate making payments.</strong></blockquote><p>Go back to my last piece for <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>a basic discussion of liquidity</u></a>. In the context of current events, a rise in the value of a dollar swap is supposed to offset a decline in the exchange rate of the dollar against the Yen. This is supposed to preserve the “principal” or the “acquisition price” of this “quasi-Yen U.S. investment”. If illiquidity and volatility in the swap market prevents that from happening, those foreign hedge funds will struggle to hold onto those dollar assets. This is especially the case because of the terms of those FX swaps.</p><p>Recall that FX swaps have collateral- the currency you “swapped” up front! They also have terms. Movements in exchange rates don’t affect the prices of the future “swap” i.e. repayment. But they <strong>can affect collateral terms</strong>. It is <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/central-bank-collateral-policy-monetarypolicy101/\"><u>convention in this newsletter</u></a> to refer to the valuation of collateral as the “collateral price”. You can “sell” assets for their “market price” or their “collateral price”. Instability often emerges when “market prices” have an immediate and direct impact on “collateral prices” (I wrote about this at length <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/investigating-the-role-of-credit/\"><u>in the Eurozone context in May 2020</u></a>). It is typical in the world of FX swaps to require additional collateral based on movements in some other underlying market. In essence, the terms of the dollar swap requires a certain “price” to be paid, and the terms allow for the “devaluation” of the current collateral and subsequently the sudden obligation to provide “more collateral”.</p><p>Meanwhile, even without the collateral issues the “maturity length” or time before a swap is “closed out” is far smaller than the “maturity length” of the asset holdings those fx swaps are partly financing. In other words, they are using dollar swaps to finance holdings of assets with much longer maturities. This is the meaning behind “shadow banking” (which you can read much more about in <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-night-they-reread-pozsar-in-his-absence/\"><u>my 2023 piece on Zoltan Pozsar and his early 2010s work</u></a>.) To be “maturity matched” they would have to find lenders willing to provide forex swaps of 5 years, 10 years or more. Which brings me back, yet again, to my <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>“Utopian Vision”</u></a> piece:</p><blockquote>In practice, even if you pursue the production of “quasi-treasury bills”, there are <strong>all sorts of mismatches (large or small) that you take on in order to roughly get the safety you are looking for. And that works… until it doesn’t</strong>. Complete and perfect collateral “matched book” trading rarely occurs. What gets called “matched book” in <a href=\"https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2014/04/mixing-and-matching-collateral-in-dealer-banks/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>practice involves</u></a> “significant <strong>amounts of maturity</strong>, credit, and collateral transformation, exposing them to interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk”. In other words, mismatches. [Emphasis added]</blockquote><p>Issuing an obligation with “fragile” moneyness to finance asset holdings that you intend to hold far longer than the maturity date of those “shadow monies” works as long as that fragile moneyness holds up. FX swaps have been one of those shadow monies, and the sudden liquidation of large amounts of them may not literally be a “shadow money run” in the sense that people doubt counterparties holding up to FX swap terms. But nevertheless, the financial stress of this financial crisis is leading to those positions being liquidated. As we’ve discussed, deleveraging one place creates pressures for deleveraging across what we might call the “financial supply chain”.</p><p>Which brings us to the foreign exchange market itself. Lets say you google two currency pairs, like the United States Dollar (USD) and the Japanese Yen (JPY), along with the phrase “exchange rate”. The graph that will be staring back at you will be the exchange rate that emerges from the current buying and selling of Dollars and Yen. Much of the current talk of Dollar collapse, besides movements in the Treasury market, is the movement of the dollar against other currencies. This is based on the presumption that these markets are deep and liquid. That presumption <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/work836.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>was only valid (and not fully valid) in a world before the global regulatory reforms</u></a> coming out of the Great Financial Crisis. If that presumption isn’t correct, then judgments based on spot dollar exchange rates will be mistaken.&nbsp;</p><p>On Thursday “Risk.Net” ran a headline <a href=\"https://www.risk.net/markets/7961368/eurusd-liquidity-worse-than-covid-on-april-9-dealers-say?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“FX liquidity ‘worse than Covid’ amid tariff volatility, dealers say”</u></a>. There’s plenty of dense detail in this article, but the takeaway is that “intraday” (within one single day) volatility in the foreign exchange market went up “more than five fold” this week because of Trump’s Tariff announcements. This makes sense because the spot foreign exchange market is <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/work836.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>not separate from the foreign exchange swap market</u></a>. They are connected because an implicit exchange rate can be derived from how dollar swaps are trading. So when liquidity goes down in the dollar swap market, <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/work836.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>that “spills over” onto the smaller spot</u></a> market. </p><p>Meanwhile, liquidity goes down when volatility goes up a lot and institutions, particularly large banks, pull away from the dollar swap market. Basically, the same thing that operates domestically also applies to the foreign exchange market. Liquidity constraints from both new liquidity requirements and new capital requirements <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2309b.htm?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>lead the foreign exchange “dealing desks” at these major bank-holding companies</u></a> to shrink their activities when these constraints start to “bind”. So the same VaR blowouts we talked about Wednesday do not just lead to pressure to sell assets,<strong> they also directly drain liquidity from the currency markets</strong>. It is truly astounding to get a handle on <strong>all the knock on implications from Donald Trump’s volatility.</strong></p><p>This drain of liquidity is no idle matter. It is even key to the exchange rate dynamics between Europe and Japan. Roughly 18 months ago the Bank of International Settlements put out <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2309b.htm?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>some absolutely essential research</u></a> on the key role the largest U.S. banks play in the global forex swap market . As an aside, there’s a reason that I keep on bringing up the BIS so much. They are the core institution which takes these international financial architecture issues seriously and produces relevant and heavily empirical research on these topics. There’s a reason many people at the margins of economics have gravitated to the BIS of all the major official institutions.</p><p>Anyway, <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2309b.htm?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the key point</u></a> from that research is:</p><blockquote>US banks stand out as <strong>pivotal FX swap intermediaries</strong>. In particular, Japanese banks that swap out of yen and into euros, and euro area banks swapping in the other direction, <strong>both transact via the US dollar mainly with US banks rather than with each other.</strong> [Emphasis added]</blockquote><p>In other words, not only do European Banks and Japanese banks engage in dollar swaps to provide their customers with dollars, they <strong>even enter dollar swaps to acquire Yen or Euros</strong>. If this is truly the end of the dollar, Europe and Japan better get on building a much bigger and more reliable EUR/JPN swap market. That they rely on the U.S. for even this is a sign of how far we have to go before the “end of the dollar” talk becomes even a “concept of a plan”.</p><p>Which brings me to my final quote from Hyun Shin, this <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-29/hyun-song-shin-on-what-we-just-learned-from-the-yen-carry-trade-blowup?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>one from the Bloomberg Odd Lots interview about the August 2024 financial stress episode</u></a> quoted thousands of words ago:</p><blockquote>This is why during financial stress periods these FX swap bases spike, and then there has to be central bank swap lines to quell [them], etc. But there's <strong>nothing in principle that says it always has to go towards a dollar, right?</strong> If your intention is to engage in a yen carry trade, but through using FX swaps <strong>you could borrow yen and then acquire that yen obligation by going through the swap.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>And so <strong>one telltale sign is what happened to the FX swap basis</strong> during this recent episode. And in fact one of the interesting findings is <strong>that the dollar FX basis versus the yen hardly budged. It's actually a very small movement which is very atypical of a financial stress event.</strong></blockquote><p>To spell out what Hyun is saying: if institutions which are deleveraging are not all foreign institutions indebted in dollars but, instead, more and more U.S. institutions are, in effect, borrowing yen and euros to invest elsewhere- this could explain why exchange rate illiquidity is not leading to a (current) hunger for dollars and not leading to the kind of forex swap pricing (read distance between “bidding” and “asking” prices i.e. spreads)&nbsp; we typically associate with financial stress. In these circumstances the latest quote on dollar exchange rates are a lot less important than the degree of volatility in the foreign exchange markets themselves. Meanwhile the volatility of&nbsp; the “Chicago Board Option Exchange Volatility Index”, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>discussed in Wednesday’s piece</u></a>, is a sufficient shorthand guide.</p><p>The conclusion of all this is that the dollar’s movements recently are not a dollar crisis in the sense of a <strong>collapse</strong> of the dollar. Instead they are a “dollar fx swap crisis”, whose magnitude or duration is impossible to say. It could end up being an episode like August of last year… but that’s quite unlikely. The questions about the dollar are longer term, though the dysfunction of the international financial architecture itself has solidified doubts which should be entering people’s minds for other reasons. In particular, the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>Trump-Musk Payments Crisis</u></a>.

Crisis moments always are: because everyone is tired and stressed, things move very quickly, and all of the most intricate and obscure questions about the Financial System’s “plumbing” become relevant all at once. We don’t truly know what has happened in full until what happened is dissected after the fact, often using data which only gets published (or at least reported on) in the following weeks and months. Sometimes years. I have a good track record of course. I covered all the intricate aspects of the Federal Reserve crisis facilities during Covid. I have, of course, burnished my reputation in the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis (to say the least). I also did pretty good in the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. All my pieces from that time got praise and many of them got Media coverage. From my opening salvo “Every Complex Banking Issue All At Once: The Failure of Silicon Valley Bank in One Brief Summary and Five Quick Implications” all the way to a piece correcting the record on FDR’s position on bank deposit insurance.. \n\nMy favorite piece was, of course, on Zoltan Pozsar, a legendary wall street guru and financial system “plumbing expert”. Titled “The Night They Reread Pozsar (in his absence)” (a reference to a short 2009 blog post/long LSE lecture from Paul Krugman entitled “The Night They Reread Minsky” which is in turn a reference to a 1968 Musical Comedy by Norman Lear). The focus of the piece was the irony that the world’s foremost expert on the production of “shadow money” as a result of the limitations of deposit insurance (read the piece to understand what any of this means!) could not comment on a shadow money crisis. That's because his employer, Credit Suisse, was caught in the maelstrom. Less than six weeks later I was quoted in a Wall Street Journal profile of Pozsar:  \n\n“Zoltan always keeps the reader a step removed. [...] There’s always a sense that he knows a little bit more than you ever will, and there’s no real way you can get to his level, but you can get close by reading his stuff.”\n\nGiven that Mr. Pozsar’s work is closely tied to the issues that sparked this year’s banking turmoil, some on social media had wondered why they hadn’t heard much from him recently.\n\nA March 30 blog post by Mr. Tankus featured an image made in jest of Mr. Pozsar’s face on a milk carton. [Emphasis added]\n\nI will forever love the fact that I got the phrase “an image made in jest of Mr. Pozsar’s face on a milk carton.” into the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnyway, while I’m proud of the coverage I did of the Silicon Valley Bank crisis, I did make a major mistake. In a piece on the treasury market that first week I posited that the dysfunction was related to uncertainty about whether the Fed would cut rates because of macroeconomic reasons (which aren’t relevant today). I learned not that long after from well placed sources that while my argument was coherent, it was false. In September 2023 I finally wrote up that I was wrong in a piece straightforwardly titled “I Was Wrong About Post-SVB Treasury Market Strains- Here’s Why”. I heard two explanations for what happened to the Treasury Market during Silicon Valley Bank, but the central one is also the central one in the current Trump Tariff Stock Market Crisis: “The role of high frequency trading desks and hedge funds”.\n\nLet's take a step back for a second. To understand any of this, we have to understand what “liquidity” is. The key, and most intuitive notion, is the idea that an extremely “liquid” asset is one that you can sell—or send as a payment to a creditor—at or near some “accounted for” value. The most obvious “accounted for” value is the very front of a physical dollar bill. If you have one dollar, you can give it to your friend in payment for your one dollar debt to your friend. Your checking account is another one. \n\nThat checking account balance is “liquid” when it's easy to convert 100 dollars of your balance into a 100 dollar credit card payment, 100 dollar utility payment. If a “chase dollar” fluctuated against a “Wells Fargo” dollar, they would both be less liquid (unless one was the persistently stronger one). This happened in the United States banking system all the time before the Civil War! Other “accounted for” values are the acquisition cost of an asset or the most recent “market price” quotations. Think of selling a house. Few people believe they will be able to sell their house in a day at the price their neighbors house just sold for. The crucial thing is that liquidity is, as the social scientists love to say, a “social relation”. It’s not something that is “within” objects. It's a relation between an asset and a financial ecosystem. And the ecosystem can change rapidly.\n\nIn essence, the highest form of “money” is also the most “liquid” asset (we will be skipping the deep, fascinating, but far too involved philosophical question “What is Money?” on today’s emergency crisis coverage). But, generally speaking, people do not speak about liquidity in terms of “money” and “not money”. They treat it as a spectrum. Money itself is a spectrum, hence the term “moneyness”. By chance, I spent some of this weekend rereading a transcript of a secret December 10th 1949 Executive Session Congressional hearing that ultimately led up to the Federal Reserve’s “independence” (the providence and context of this document is a whole other story!) One particular quote stood out from one of my favorite forgotten economists, the Columbia University professor Albert Hart. It is an extremely well stated summation of precisely the point I am driving at with today’s piece:\n\nI enthusiastically agree that we must not draw the line at a particular point between what is money and not money and disregard the liquidity of things we fought to classify as money. But I do think we have to pay a lot of attention to the degree of liquidity of the liquid assets, both as between classes of assets and for the same asset at different times.\n\nThis insight from Hart is absolutely essential. In a very real sense, the core problems the financial system has faced (prior to the current constitutional payments crisis) is the total disregard of his insight by policymakers. As I had started commenting way back in September 2019, regulatory requirements on “too big to fail” banks have made their balance sheets more rigid, especially to lower and even “no default risk” assets like treasury securities. What does it mean for a balance sheet to be “rigid”? In essence, it means that it can’t expand its liabilities very much to acquire more assets.\n\nThink about this in terms of Fonzie from the half-century old sitcom Happy Days. Fonzie has a balance sheet. It has assets on one side and liabilities on the other. Subtract all of Fonzie’s liabilities from his assets, and voila! You have his net worth. Fonzie’s “Leverage” is measured by dividing Fonzie’s liabilities by his net worth. The higher the ratio, the more “leveraged” Fonzie is. “More Levered Fonzie” has bought more assets by taking on more liabilities, but has the same net worth. That means he’s more leveraged. To recap, leverage is liabilities divided by net worth. Of course, it gets much more complicated than this. But the complications are just added detail that makes it harder to follow. At its core, this is what people mean when they say “leverage” or say a company or person is “highly levered”.`\n\nSo, to return to the topic at hand: when balance sheets are said to be “rigid” what it means is that they can’t “expand their balance sheet” and get more highly leveraged (read: issue IOUs) to buy assets. The “rigidity” that was regulatorily imposed on the largest banks in the world was done as a result of the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2008. Regulators, in particular the international committee the “Basel committee on Banking Supervision”, sought to solve liquidity problems by simply requiring large banks to hold “High Quality Liquid Assets” (HQLA). They sought to solve solvency problems- essentially banks not having enough net worth- by putting an absolute cap on how many assets they could own relative to a given “net worth”. \n\nIn other words, they put “leverage requirements” on banks- specifically on “bank holding companies”. Before the Great Financial Crisis banks could get their leverage ratios as high as 40 to 1 i.e. their net worth was 2.5% of their assets. They could do this by having the part of the company that “wasn’t a bank” take on that leverage.. You can read about the history of the Basel committee in my very first academic publication, a book review, published in 2013.\n\nThe committee’s approach to liquidity essentially treated “high liquidity” as something assets inherently have rather than something that monetary and financial infrastructure produce. In a certain sense, the highest tier of “High Quality Liquid Assets” were treated as inherently money and, to use Hart’s phrase, the Basel Committee “disregard[ed] the liquidity of things we fought to classify as money”. It also ignored “the degree of liquidity [...] for the same asset at different times”. The results have been a chronic problem with varying severity ever since the regulations were fully implemented. \n\nAt the same time banks were required to hold large amounts of either treasuries or settlement balances (essentially the “checking account balances” of banks at the Federal Reserve), their role in providing liquidity to the treasury market was undermined. There were a lot of problems leading into the 2008 financial crisis, but one of its strengths was that big banks could always expand their balance sheets to purchase treasury securities since these were classed as “no risk” assets by the previous iteration of international financial regulatory standards. Banks could lever up (issue more liabilities relative to their net worth) to buy treasuries and then turn to the central bank when they needed liquidity. In other words, there’s a question of how much of the largest bank’s leverage was “bad” and how much served a purpose: taking treasury securities on their balance sheets when needed.\n\nThis is one of those ecosystem questions discussed above. If large banks, technically “large bank holding companies”, aren’t going to “absorb” treasuries: who will? In 2020 I claimed that financial markets are only generally liquid, to the extent they are generally liquid, because the government “franchises” the ability to create dollars to chartered banks and those chartered banks, in turn, “sub-franchises” liquidity throughout the financial system. Of course, the government can also provide liquidity directly to non-bank entities. As Columbia Law professor Lev Menand and former New York Federal Reserve Senior Policy Advisor Josh Younger pointed out in a paper two years ago, the Federal Reserve has been “franchising” liquidity directly to non-bank financial institutions for at least 70 years through entering “repurchase agreements” with them (read about what repurchase agreements are in this piece I put out in late February). Then of course there’s the Fed’s “emergency powers”.\n\nWhat ended up happening is that hedge funds, entities who take on lots of leverage based on investment from “accredited investors” (read rich people or institutions like pensions or universities), have stepped into the breach. They have taken on leverage to buy treasuries and then manage their risks with other derivatives that reference treasuries. I’m gonna skip the details because I just have too much to cover. The point is, hedge funds and other similarly placed entities have become “shadow dealers”, to use Lev Menand and Josh Younger’s phrase. This is what I said about this in my 2023 “I Was Wrong” piece::\n\nIn reading this paper I have become convinced that I have underrated the role of these high frequency trading desks and hedge funds. The core issue is one of monetary design, but these institutions reflect that lack of monetary design. Rather than being sideshows, their behavior in recent years reflects the opportunity to partially take the place left behind by more rigid balance sheets of dealers, who remained part of bank holding companies. At the same time, since “shadow” dealers are further outside the reach of the “regulatory perimeter”, they don’t have the same obligations as licensed dealers. They don’t have to regularly participate in treasury markets, and provision liquidity. Nor do they have access to the backstops that licensed government securities dealers have.\n\nThese HFT desks and hedge funds run from treasury markets at the first sign of trouble, and that’s precisely what they did after SVB failed. On the other hand, I was not wrong in 2019 or 2020 to think that regulating these entities more wouldn’t solve the fundamental problem. Making their balance sheets more rigid will just drain liquidity from treasury markets further, which would need to be offset one way or another. [Emphasis added]\n\nThe financial stability problem is that hedge funds, and other similarly placed entities are extremely “procyclical”. That is, they expand greatly when times are good and they pull back sharply in bad times. Specifically, both their “internal” risk limits and external regulation encourages them to “have” a certain amount of “capital” (think “have a certain net worth”) for how much “risk” they are taking on. How do you know how much risk you’re taking on? Well you don’t. But for risk management purposes and external regulation purposes “risk” gets administratively and legally defined as “what a model says”. Specifically the institution’s “Value at Risk” (VaR) statistical models. You can predict what happens next. When volatility spikes, they are supposed to take less risk. Which means having fewer liabilities for the same level of net worth. Let alone net worth falling as asset values fall!\n\nWall Street, in its infinite wisdom, has made a handy measure of expected volatility. Well actually, not Wall Street. This handy tool is a product of LaSalle Street, Chicago’s “Wall Street”. If New York is the center of stock trading in the United States, Chicago is the home of derivatives. The Chicago Board of Trade was founded in 1848 and has traded derivatives ever since. Now, of course it started with “physical delivery” futures contracts for agricultural commodities. But fundamentally, it's the same business nearly two centuries later. Anyway, this handy product was created by the “Chicago Board Option Exchange” (CBOE), an institution quite a bit younger (in fact with a 1993 birthday it's younger than I am.) This product is simply called the “CBOE Volatility Index”\n\nOn Monday we talked about “index providers” and “index funds”. While those are different businesses, CBOE has a lot of vertical integration i.e. it provides the index and it provides the product that “references” the index. CBOE created the “CBOE Volatility Index” and it has created “Cboe Volatility Index® (VX) Futures” as well as the “Cboe Volatility Index® (VIX®) Options”, plus a bunch of other products. As you can see from the graph above, VIX has spiked to a level only comparable to March 2020 (Covid) and the Great Financial Crisis. I saw someone on CNBC yesterday afternoon call a VIX futures or options contract price the “price of a parachute”. \n\nWhy has volatility spiked? Well, Donald Trump of course. Financial market participants have finally caught up to the fact that Trump’s second presidential term is a completely different beast. There is nothing currently constraining the global economy, and thus global financial system, from running on Trump’s moment to moment erratic behavior. Hence why 104% tariffs against China came at midnight. As the headline of this piece says, it was those tariffs that tipped the Treasury market over into deep distress. \n\nI am writing these words at 7:08 AM and I have spent all night trying to put all this into a readable form. My information is basically out of date as of 3:00 AM so I’m not going to make definitive claims about what is happening. Nevertheless, I’m willing to stake out this position: today was the Trump Tariff Crisis’s “Lehman Brothers moment” i.e. the moment where things shook loose and there is no turning back. When Lehman Brothers went into sudden bankruptcy there was no wishing that crisis away. The same is true here. While we are still in the fog, and my information is hours out of date, I firmly believe April 9th 2025 will be a date remembered like September 15th 2008.\n\nWhat is clear is that until there is a fundamental resolution to this situation, volatility will stay extremely high. With volatility extremely high, the global financial system will continue trading on every piece of Trump news. Hence the 15 minutes on Monday where the stock market rallied and went up, in aggregate, 2.5 Trillion dollars based on a random twitter account’s tweet reporting false claims about a change in Trump’s approach to tariffs. Once the “conventional wisdom” among stock market traders and this was judged to be false, those 2.5 Trillion dollars evaporated. The stock market is trading in an erratic “hyper-fundamentals” fashion where the only fundamentals that matter are the current state of Trump’s “thinking”. In essence, the every financial market in the globe is finally trading in a manner similar to how MSNBC has been making its viewers feel every day for the past few months. This is because of a combination of the intense volatility and the overwhelming fear.\n\nStock traders are still desperately seeking any sign of hope that this will all go away which is why the stock market is prone to these bizarre rallies, before another crazy Trump statement or action brings them back to reality. In a certain sense, they have no other choice. Financial markets are not remotely able to function on this kind of volatility continuously. In essence, this kind of extreme instability is definitionally a crisis because it must be resolved so that the basic stability, even if it's a “false” stability produced by highly motivated conventions, can be established or reestablished.\n\nPutting this all together, financial regulators have been regulatorily treating United States Treasury Securities as “money” without making sure that the infrastructure was there to guarantee its liquidity on a 24-7 basis. More generally, we’ve increasingly relied on institutions like hedge funds to hold large amounts of financial assets as we discouraged large banks from doing so. Hedge Funds run on leverage. As market volatility explodes, they sell assets in an attempt to deleverage. But they were absorbing assets for the rest of the economic system. For every seller there must be a buyer. So more buyers must be forthcoming or prices need to decline to fit these big assets in the ever smaller amount of “free balance sheet space”. Think of a clown car.\n\nHedge Funds, and other similar non-bank firms,  attempts to shrink their balance sheets will lead others to try to shrink their balance sheet which will just cause further market dislocations in superficially unrelated markets. This deleveraging pressure is clearly happening globally. Perversely, the erratic unreliability of the U.S. is, just as it did in 2008, getting the rest of the world to ever more desperately chase down dollars. Pricing in the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis has not happened, and I do not expect it to happen anytime soon, as I wrote about yesterday. Ergo no running from the dollar.\n\nStill, the question remains, who absorbs assets from the asset absorbers?\n\nWhy, the Federal Reserve of course. Unlike a lot of commentators, I think they will step in and stabilize financial markets domestically. The tricky question is… will they do so globally? In 2008, and again in 2020, “Swap Lines” (think “lines of credit\") with other central banks has been critical to stabilizing global financial markets. This time is different. Why would Trump want to cut off the rest of the world until they end their trade deficits with the United States, as well as cut off foreign aid, but be okay with Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve lending trillions of dollars to foreign central banks? European policymakers already started to, correctly, think about this possibility weeks ago.\n\nTrump’s orbit may not have known about Central Bank Swap Lines in the first term, but they do now. Which brings me to a grim thing I posted on Facebook on December 30th 2016:\n\nThe worst day of the Trump presidency might be when someone tells Trump what Central Bank Liquidity Swaps are.\n\nThis is all the international commentary I have time for in this already long piece. I’m going to bed. Good morning, and good luck. On the bright side, Democracy surviving in the United States looks so much better than it did two weeks ago.","html":"<p><strong>READERS NOTE: I'm not going to cover this piece asking for Subscriptions.

Crisis moments always are: because everyone is tired and stressed, things move very quickly, and all of the most intricate and obscure questions about the Financial System’s “plumbing” become relevant all at once. We don’t truly know what has happened in full until what happened is dissected after the fact, often using data which only gets published (or at least reported on) in the following weeks and months. Sometimes years. I have a good track record of course. I covered all the intricate aspects of the Federal Reserve crisis facilities during Covid. I have, of course, burnished my reputation in the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis (to say the least). I also did pretty good in the Silicon Valley Bank crisis.

The focus of the piece was the irony that the world’s foremost expert on the production of “shadow money” as a result of the limitations of deposit insurance (read the piece to understand what any of this means!) could not comment on a shadow money crisis.

They sought to solve solvency problems- essentially banks not having enough net worth- by putting an absolute cap on how many assets they could own relative to a given “net worth”.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, they put “leverage requirements” on banks- specifically on “bank holding companies”. Before the Great Financial Crisis banks could get their leverage ratios as high as 40 to 1 i.e. their net worth was 2.5% of their assets. They could do this by having the part of the company that “wasn’t a bank” take on that leverage.. You can read about the history of the Basel committee in my very first academic publication, a book review, <a href=\"https://files.crisesnotes.com/reviewofkeynesianeconomics.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>published in 2013</u></a>.</p><p>The committee’s approach to liquidity essentially treated “high liquidity” as something assets inherently have rather than something that monetary and financial infrastructure produce. In a certain sense, the highest tier of “High Quality Liquid Assets” were treated as inherently money and, to use Hart’s phrase, the Basel Committee “disregard[ed] the liquidity of things we fought to classify as money”. It also ignored “the degree of liquidity [...] for the same asset at different times”. The results have been a chronic problem with varying severity ever since the regulations were fully implemented.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time banks were required to hold large amounts of either treasuries or settlement balances (essentially the “checking account balances” of banks at the Federal Reserve), their role in providing liquidity to the treasury market was undermined. There were a lot of problems leading into the 2008 financial crisis, but one of its strengths was that big banks could always expand their balance sheets to purchase treasury securities since these were classed as “no risk” assets by the previous iteration of international financial regulatory standards. Banks could lever up (issue more liabilities relative to their net worth) to buy treasuries and then turn to the central bank when they needed liquidity. In other words, there’s a question of how much of the largest bank’s leverage was “bad” and how much served a purpose: taking treasury securities <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u>on their balance sheets when needed</u></a>.</p><p>This is one of those ecosystem questions discussed above. If large banks, technically “large bank holding companies”, aren’t going to “absorb” treasuries: who will? In 2020 <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u>I claimed that financial markets</u></a> are only generally liquid, to the extent <strong>they are</strong> generally liquid, because the government “franchises” the ability to create dollars to chartered banks and those chartered banks, in turn, “sub-franchises” liquidity throughout the financial system. Of course, the government can also provide liquidity directly to non-bank entities. As Columbia Law professor Lev Menand and former New York Federal Reserve Senior Policy Advisor Josh Younger pointed out <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>in a paper two years ago</u></a>, the Federal Reserve has been “franchising” liquidity directly to non-bank financial institutions for at least 70 years through entering “repurchase agreements” with them (read about what repurchase agreements are in this piece <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/how-can-we-know-if-government-payments-stop-an-exploratory-analysis-of-banking-system-warning-signs/?ref=notes-on-the-crises-newsletter\"><u>I put out in late February</u></a>). Then of course there’s the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/from-relic-to-indispensable-how-the-federal-reserve-nearly-gave-up-its-emergency-lending-powers-in-1967/\"><u>Fed’s “emergency powers”</u></a>.</p><p>What ended up happening is that hedge funds, entities who take on lots of leverage based on investment from “accredited investors” (read rich people or institutions like pensions or universities), have stepped into the breach. They have taken on leverage to buy treasuries and then manage their risks with <a href=\"https://www.financialresearch.gov/working-papers/files/OFRwp-21-01-hedge-funds-and-the-treasury-cash-futures-disconnect.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>other derivatives that reference treasuries</u></a>. I’m gonna skip the details because I just have too much to cover. The point is, hedge funds and other similarly placed entities have become “shadow dealers”, to use Lev Menand and Josh Younger’s phrase. This is what I said about <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>this in my 2023</u></a> “I Was Wrong” piece::</p><blockquote>In reading this paper I have become convinced that <strong>I have underrated the role of these high frequency trading desks and hedge funds</strong>. The core issue is one of monetary design, but these institutions <strong>reflect that lack of monetary design</strong>. Rather than being sideshows, their behavior in recent years reflects the opportunity to partially take the place left behind by more rigid balance sheets of dealers, who remained part of bank holding companies. At the same time, since “shadow” dealers are further outside the reach of the “regulatory perimeter”, they don’t have the same obligations as licensed dealers. They don’t have to regularly participate in treasury markets, and provision liquidity. Nor do they have access to the backstops that licensed government securities dealers have.</blockquote><blockquote>These HFT desks and hedge funds run from treasury markets at the first sign of trouble, and that’s precisely what they did after SVB failed. On the other hand, I was not wrong in 2019 or 2020 to think that <strong>regulating these entities more wouldn’t solve the fundamental problem</strong>. Making their balance sheets more rigid will just drain liquidity from treasury markets further, which would need to be offset one way or another. [Emphasis added]</blockquote><p>The financial stability problem is that hedge funds, and other similarly placed entities are extremely “procyclical”. That is, they expand greatly when times are good and they pull back sharply in bad times. Specifically, both their “internal” risk limits and external regulation encourages them to “have” a certain amount of “capital” (think “have a certain net worth”) for how much “risk” they are taking on. How do you know how much risk you’re taking on? Well you don’t. But for risk management purposes and external regulation purposes “risk” gets administratively and legally defined as “what a model says”. Specifically the institution’s “Value at Risk” (VaR) statistical models. You can predict what happens next. When volatility spikes, they are supposed to take less risk. Which means having fewer liabilities for the same level of net worth. Let alone net worth falling as asset values fall!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfoIbVE_slQi2Q8XyGLFJrlO0VgAHhvmlKaBGWeb7KGGRoC3dHs_PI3hQGDh6qhIN8sQpjfrnKr7_l2XLiZSkGWnsR9sRKd_muOaGPY6g1l0oBTeWsYiR0IBNcdylqH0XWLLK2o?key=SgKpZX-TsVd0N1nTTbk01LEg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"229\"></figure><p>Wall Street, in its infinite wisdom, has made a handy measure of expected volatility. Well actually, not Wall Street. This handy tool is a product of LaSalle Street, <strong>Chicago’s “Wall Street”.</strong> If New York is the center of stock trading in the United States, Chicago is the home of derivatives. The Chicago Board of Trade was founded in 1848 and has traded derivatives ever since. Now, of course it started with “physical delivery” futures contracts for agricultural commodities. But fundamentally, it's the same business nearly two centuries later. Anyway, this handy product was created by the “Chicago Board Option Exchange” (CBOE), an institution quite a bit younger (in fact with a 1993 birthday it's younger than I am.) This product is simply called the “CBOE Volatility Index”</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcpS0vEXIT9fvqOtcxt58QUCjY4IHIGjgHpz5rx0zkxCdSZ79lXFwuchQn3IeCEllDwwLIa6c_TV5CtEenln8gnO3K6pert6CawDLKug9pVM6lI8FkIbOfEonTT-NvWOsmsX_KyyQ?key=SgKpZX-TsVd0N1nTTbk01LEg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"257\"></figure><p>On Monday we talked about <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/trumps-liberation-day-and-the-ongoing-stock-market-crash/\"><u>“index providers” and “index funds”</u></a>. While those are different businesses, CBOE has a lot of vertical integration i.e. it provides the index and it provides the product that “references” the index. CBOE created the “CBOE Volatility Index” <a href=\"https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/vix_options/VIX_fact_sheet.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>and it has created</u></a> “Cboe Volatility Index® (VX) Futures” as well as the “Cboe Volatility Index® (VIX®) Options”, plus a bunch of other products. As you can see from the graph above, VIX has spiked to a level only comparable to March 2020 (Covid) and the Great Financial Crisis. I saw someone on CNBC yesterday afternoon call a VIX futures or options contract price the “price of a parachute”.&nbsp;</p><p>Why has volatility spiked? Well, Donald Trump of course. Financial market participants have finally caught up to the fact that Trump’s second presidential term is a completely different beast. There is nothing currently constraining the global economy, and thus global financial system, from running on Trump’s moment to moment erratic behavior. Hence why 104% tariffs against China came at midnight. As the headline of this piece says, it was those tariffs that tipped the Treasury market over into deep distress.&nbsp;</p><p>I am writing these words at 7:08 AM and I have spent all night trying to put all this into a readable form. My information is basically out of date as of 3:00 AM so I’m not going to make definitive claims about what is happening. Nevertheless, I’m willing to stake out this position: today was the Trump Tariff Crisis’s “Lehman Brothers moment” i.e. the moment where things shook loose and there is no turning back. When Lehman Brothers went into sudden bankruptcy there was no wishing that crisis away. The same is true here. While we are still in the fog, and my information is hours out of date, I firmly believe April 9th 2025 will be a date remembered like September 15th 2008.</p><p>What is clear is that until there is a fundamental resolution to this situation, volatility will stay extremely high. With volatility extremely high, the global financial system will continue trading on every piece of Trump news. Hence the 15 minutes on Monday where the stock market rallied and went up, in aggregate, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/-this-is-madness-the-15-minutes-that-rocked-stock-market-desks?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>2.5 Trillion dollars</u></a> based on a random twitter account’s tweet reporting false claims about <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/-this-is-madness-the-15-minutes-that-rocked-stock-market-desks?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>a change in Trump’s approach to tariffs</u></a>. Once the “conventional wisdom” among stock market traders and this was judged to be false, those 2.5 Trillion dollars evaporated. The stock market is trading in an erratic “hyper-fundamentals” fashion where the only fundamentals that matter are the current state of Trump’s “thinking”. In essence, the every financial market in the globe is finally trading in a manner similar to how MSNBC has been making its viewers feel every day for the past few months. This is because of a combination of the intense volatility and the overwhelming fear.</p><p>Stock traders are still desperately seeking any sign of hope that this will all go away which is why the stock market is prone to these bizarre rallies, before another crazy Trump statement or action brings them back to reality. In a certain sense, they have no other choice. Financial markets are not remotely able to function on this kind of volatility continuously. In essence, this kind of extreme instability is definitionally a crisis because it must be resolved so that the basic stability, even if it's a “false” stability produced by highly motivated conventions, can be established or reestablished.</p><p>Putting this all together, financial regulators have been regulatorily treating United States Treasury Securities as “money” without making sure that the infrastructure was there to guarantee its liquidity on a 24-7 basis. More generally, we’ve increasingly relied on institutions like hedge funds to hold large amounts of financial assets as we discouraged large banks from doing so. Hedge Funds run on leverage. As market volatility explodes, they sell assets in an attempt to deleverage. But they were absorbing assets for the rest of the economic system. For every seller there must be a buyer. So more buyers must be forthcoming or prices need to decline to fit these big assets in the ever smaller amount of “free balance sheet space”. Think of a clown car.</p><p>Hedge Funds, and other similar non-bank firms,&nbsp; attempts to shrink their balance sheets will lead others to try to shrink their balance sheet which will just cause further market dislocations in superficially unrelated markets. This deleveraging pressure is clearly happening globally. Perversely, the erratic unreliability of the U.S. is, just as it did in 2008, getting the rest of the world to ever more desperately chase down dollars. Pricing in the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis has not happened, and I do not expect it to happen anytime soon, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor\"><u>as I wrote about yesterday</u></a>. Ergo no running from the dollar.</p><p>Still, the question remains, who absorbs assets from the asset absorbers?</p><p>Why, the Federal Reserve of course. Unlike a lot of commentators, I think they will step in and stabilize financial markets domestically. The tricky question is… will they do so globally? In 2008, and again in 2020, “Swap Lines” (think “lines of credit\") with other central banks has been critical to stabilizing global financial markets. This time is different. Why would Trump want to cut off the rest of the world until they end their trade deficits with the United States, as well as cut off foreign aid, but be okay with Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve lending trillions of dollars to foreign central banks? European policymakers already started to, correctly, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/some-european-officials-weigh-if-they-can-rely-fed-dollars-under-trump-2025-03-22/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>think about this possibility weeks ago</u></a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfm-0aBbUSUyUYGRjIK0oj87OXW3WoSOt6T6A7T5b9rO-BQPNDK5aBOKZ7qjf4cv4XwSTggFhDvRr5Xg6ynRdcDjQC9bnayy_Be-PLoAEra4jYg_nv5a_pweirEJocpHmDqRJ8zug?key=SgKpZX-TsVd0N1nTTbk01LEg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"561\"></figure><p>Trump’s orbit may not have known about Central Bank Swap Lines in the first term, but they do now.

Two months ago I tried to crash the stock market. \n\nLet me explain.\n\nI have a story to tell about the first week of the Trump Musk Payments Crisis which is crucial to understand the turbulence in financial markets since “Liberation Day”.\n\nAs regular readers know by now, my entire world changed January 31st 2025. The news that David Lebryk, the top civil servant in the U.S. Treasury, was being pushed out for objecting to DOGE’s access to the Treasury’s payments systems at the Bureau of Fiscal Service, gave me a panic attack (for readers who need an introduction or a refresher, check out the interview Paul Krugman did with me.) That panic attack was about two things at once. The enormity of the dangerous implications of DOGE’s access to the Federal Government’s internal payments system was one. The second thing my panic attack was about was the nicheness of the knowledge. I knew first hand how few experts there were on the Treasury internal payments system because up to that date I couldn’t find an expert to answer my questions. I was completely overwhelmed by the prospect that a Venn Diagram of “people with relevant governmental payments system expertise” and “people with prominent media platforms willing to use that platform to straightforwardly communicate the terrifying danger” would leave only one person at the intersection. \n\nThis terrifying feeling was not helped by the half dozen or so conversations I had with former Federal Reserve and Treasury officials that weekend. They left me with the distinct impression that they were as alarmed as I was, and their plan A was… my newsletter. Let’s just say that in MY Plan A I am no well placed former government official’s plan A. \n\nSubscribe\n\nAnyway, at 1 AM Tuesday February 4th Wired reported that one DOGE employee, Marko Elez, had read and write code access. 6.5 hours later I confirmed their reporting in this very newsletter. Incidentally, I have not yet mentioned in the newsletter that on March 13th, in a piece dissecting what happened in that first week, Wired was able to credit my reporting in print (these things take time!). Wired cites me twice in their long piece:\n\nThe financial journalist and payments expert Nathan Tankus would later say that the news of Lebryk’s retirement gave him a “panic attack,” because everyone above Lebryk was a political appointee. [...] The fact of [DOGE employee Marko] Elez’s read/write access to Treasury payment systems, confirmed later by Tankus, became a source of contention. \n\nSo thank you to Wired.\n\nTip!\n\nI’m explaining all this to contextualize my mindset the first week of the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis. The Tuesday prior I was the publisher of a sleepy, in the weeds newsletter “breaking” stories about the Federal Reserve… from 1942. A week later I was suddenly an investigative journalist keeping pace with the country’s premier tech publication on a technology story. This is where the point of this piece comes into focus. I had a previously scheduled interview that day for Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast to talk about my 18 month effort to FOIA the Federal Reserve. \n\nObviously, I wasn’t going to be talking about FOIA. I talked about the Bureau of Fiscal Service and DOGE. But I had an agenda in mind. To understand that agenda, readers need to understand an extremely prescient newsletter from Odd Lots Co-Host Joe Weisenthal.\n\nThat November 7th piece, entitled “Beware The Stock Market Vigilantes”, is worth excerpting at great length:\n\nWhen the stock market is down, people feel bad. When it’s up people feel good. If you’re an American politician (or President specifically), you’re forced to be sensitive to this in a very direct way if you want to be elected. It’s not really the same with bonds. The policy-markets nexus is just tighter with stocks.\n\nFurthermore, because the stock market is how people fund their retirements (even for public employees with access to some kind of pension), pay for college, and so on, there’s arguably a limit to how long the American economic system can go without a rising stock market\n\nI think this gets operationalized in all kinds of notable ways:\n\nThis probably puts a constraint on populist, anti-market interventions. You saw this when the trade war with China started heating up under the first Trump administration, and there were days when the market’s reaction was sharply negative to the headlines. Those tariffs didn’t have a massive economic impact, and they didn’t have a massive market impact. But it seems reasonable to think about what a much more aggressive tariff regime would have on equities.\n\nThere’s also a constraint that emerges when thinking about re-industrialization efforts (efforts whose future is ambiguous under the next administration). The idea of investing more domestically in factories etc. sounds nice to a lot of people. But it’s a very costly process, with uncertain returns. Technological leadership is also not one-off thing that you just achieve one day. It’s a constant process of risky investment, which (if you don’t have a monopoly) keeps pushing profits further out into the future. \n\n[...]\n\nAnyway, to some extent this is just all theoretical talk right now. The stock market is at all time highs and surged since the election. So there’s no immediate source of concern here. For now this is not a source of pressure on the incoming Trump administration.\n\nBut I think it’s helpful when thinking about the range of future economic possibilities (with respect to trade policy, with respect to Fed personnel decisions, and so forth) to think about the power of the stock market in limiting, or putting a curb on, some of these outcomes. [Emphasis added]\n\nI think the prescience speaks for itself. The main relevant quibble I had when I read it last November was I thought the piece conveyed an impression that politicians had to react to stock market moves. I argued, among other things, that “governments react to stock market moves because they are socialized to see them as important.” Obviously, that claim is being put to the test right now.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAnyway, when I walked into Bloomberg’s headquarters Tuesday, February 4th I had this newsletter from Joe at the top of my mind. I desperately wanted to get Marko Elez out of the Bureau of Fiscal Service and I was going to muster any resource I could. So I did my best to call up some “Stock Market Vigilantes”. My hope was that a big stock market reaction that was clearly attributable to news of DOGE’s unvarnished access to the Treasury payments system could greatly increase the pressure on them to back off. \n\nAt the end of the interview, when Tracy Alloway asked me what could go wrong from DOGE mucking about in this system, I took direct aim at waking up some “heroic” stock market vigilantes:\n\nThere's no way to exaggerate how enormously dangerous this is. Every financial market in the world, in the country, in the world should be pricing in the operational failure uncertainties of this system. Every single financial market should be pricing it in, and none of them are. None of them are even close.\n\nWith the background context, it should be pretty obvious to readers that I was taking direct aim at the stock market. Really, I was taking direct aim at every financial market. Importantly, I wasn’t trying to “manipulate them”, at least not with false information. I was trying to get financial market participants to recognize the threat posed by a failure of the treasury’s payments system. “Pricing in” the potential for the treasury payments system to fail would mean higher interest rates for Treasury securities and far lower stock prices, among many other things. If the treasury fails, profits will be decimated. Indeed, a failure bad enough would make it an open question of whether the United States dollar would continue to exist. I wanted it to be priced into financial markets, so that it would go away.\n\nSubscribeTip!\n\nNow this is all less serious than it might sound because I knew, and Tracy and Joe knew, that it was exceedingly unlikely that financial markets would price in these uncertainties. In fact, Joe says as much in the epilogue of the interview:\n\n[T]he market will freak out when something happens. But before that, if something happens and there's a payment system, something gets broken, then we're going to see a market freak out. But everyone, until that moment is just always operates [as if] “in the end, the payments will be fine”. I don't think financial markets are good at situations like this where it's very binary, where it's like the default is you just sort of expect the payments to keep on running and everything is fine, et cetera. The default is you expect them to always raise the debt ceiling eventually when they have to, or the default as you expect the Fed to step in or whatever, mint a trillion dollar coin, but how to actually think about payments not actually happening, and there not being an easy way to fix this system. I, for one, am not surprised that it's hard to price that stuff in. [emphasis added]\n\nI knew this, and agreed with it when I heard Joe say it in front of me. But I was going to try my best anyway. I was trying everything. \n\nWhile I failed to crash the stock market, those in the know understood what I was trying to do. As the saying goes, “shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.” Plenty of people, including many powerful people, were alarmed by what they heard on that interview when it was released Wednesday, February 5th at 4:00 AM ET. I can’t currently talk about this aspect of my reporting in detail, but I can say that I have strong reason to believe that that Bloomberg Odd Lots interview specifically had a profound impact on the most senior former and current Federal Reserve and Treasury officials. The financial press opinion pages had not yet dramatized the importance of this story, indeed in my view they have not done so even two months later.\n\nSubscribe\n\nI can, however, confirm that the sweep of my reporting had a profound impact on high level current and former Treasury officials that week. In fact, two Biden era United States Treasury employees have agreed to exclusively go on the record with Notes on the Crises about this. Former senior advisor to the U.S. Treasury Chastity Murphy told me: \n\nFormer colleagues and I, both within and beyond the Treasury building, were deeply concerned about Elon Musk’s operational access to the Bureau of Fiscal Service’s payment system. Many, including senior officials, turned to “Notes on the Crises” for insights into the unfolding situation. [emphasis added]\n\nMeanwhile, Former senior advisor to the U.S. Treasury Anisha Steephen explained:\n\nThe alarm among the most senior former and current Treasury officials came from the truly unprecedented nature of what Bessent and Musk’s DOGE were doing.

We universally felt there was major risk to the integrity of the payment system and broader economy given its outsized importance. [...]\n\nNotes on the Crises provided the most in-depth view of what was going on at the Fiscal Service.  Most importantly, Nathan elevated the issue beyond the usual D.C. circles and explained why it matters to people. Americans pay attention when an issue like this is in Rolling Stone\n\nAnisha’s statements are especially interesting because as a “term appointee” they remained at Treasury into the early Trump administration and, by chance, left the same day that David Lebryk did. \n\nSubscribeTip!\n\nObviously I’ll have more to say about the role Notes on the Crises played at the very highest levels that first week of February in the future based on these quotes (and much else).\n\nBut today, that’s not the important thing.\n\nThe important thing is what this tells us about the big picture. The alarm of former and current government officials about the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis did not and has not translated into conventional wisdom on Wall Street. And without conventional wisdom, financial markets won’t move. This process isn’t magical, nor do financial markets have some divine and indescribable magic. They are made of people. And not just any people, people with very particular ideological outlooks on the world. This is a group of people that did not simply believe the stock market would do well under Trump, they thought it would do significantly better under Trump than under Biden. They sufficiently believed this that fluctuation in the “odds” of a Trump victory directly translated into the behavior of the stock market. Or at least, the average wall street stock trader believed the average wall street stock trader believed that. But we won’t get into that mess right now.\n\nIf conventional wisdom among financial market participants was determined by the policy expert circles I run in, the threat of Trump’s tariffs would have led to a stock market crash in November. This past week is the first confrontation with reality during the second Trump administration that Wall Street has had as a collective. And that’s tariffs, a policy area with a wide and deep bench of expertise. The Trump-Musk Payments Crisis is still very obscure. I’ve got my work cut out for me before this threat becomes conventional wisdom.

What I will say is that the second Trump administration has benefited greatly so far by the presumption that policies that are “too negative” from the perspective of wall street would be rolled back once the negative impacts were known. Put simply, the stock market has not crashed up until now on the assumption that the second Trump administration would not “stay the course” on policies that crashed the stock market. Put this way, I hope readers can understand what a strange catch 22 this is. There is no greater reason to think that Trump’s crazy and erratic policies will be reversed than there is to think they will be permanent.

Two months ago I tried to crash the stock market.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me explain. </p><p>I have a story to tell about the first week of the Trump Musk Payments Crisis which is crucial to understand the turbulence in financial markets <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/04/April-2nd-2025-National-Liberation-Day-Trump-transcript.pdf\"><u>since “Liberation Day”</u></a>.</p><p>As regular readers know by now, my entire world changed January 31st 2025. The news that David Lebryk, the top civil servant in the U.S. Treasury, was being pushed out for objecting to DOGE’s access to the Treasury’s payments systems at the Bureau of Fiscal Service, gave me a panic attack (for readers who need an introduction or a refresher, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/musk-in-your-computers-paul-krugman-interviews-nathan-tankus/\"><u>check out the interview Paul Krugman did with me</u></a>.) That panic attack was about two things at once. The enormity of the dangerous implications of DOGE’s access to the Federal Government’s internal payments system was one. The second thing my panic attack was about was the nicheness of the knowledge. I knew first hand how few experts there were on the Treasury internal payments system because up to that date I couldn’t find an expert to answer <strong>my questions</strong>. I was completely overwhelmed by the prospect that a Venn Diagram of “people with relevant governmental payments system expertise” and “people with prominent media platforms willing to use that platform to straightforwardly communicate the terrifying danger” would leave only one person at the intersection.&nbsp;</p><p>This terrifying feeling was not helped by the half dozen or so conversations I had with former Federal Reserve and Treasury officials that weekend. They left me with the distinct impression that they were as alarmed as I was, and their plan A was… my newsletter. Let’s just say that in MY Plan A I am no well placed former government official’s plan A.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Anyway, at 1 AM Tuesday February 4th Wired reported that one DOGE employee, Marko Elez, had read and write code access. 6.5 hours later <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>I confirmed their reporting in this very newsletter</u></a>. Incidentally, I have not yet mentioned in the newsletter that on March 13th, in a piece dissecting what happened in that first week, Wired was <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>able to credit my reporting</u></a> in print (these things take time!). Wired cites me twice in their long piece:</p><blockquote>The financial journalist and payments expert Nathan Tankus would later say that the news of Lebryk’s retirement gave him a “panic attack,” because everyone above Lebryk was a political appointee. [...] The fact of [DOGE employee Marko] Elez’s read/write access to Treasury payment systems, confirmed later by Tankus, became a source of contention.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>So thank you to Wired.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/support\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Tip!</a></div><p>I’m explaining all this to contextualize my mindset the first week of the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis. The Tuesday prior I was the publisher of a sleepy, in the weeds newsletter “breaking” stories about the Federal Reserve… <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/does-restricting-treasury-purchases-to-the-open-market-matter-long-forgotten-secret-federal-reserve-memo-says-no-monetarypolicy201/\"><u>from 1942</u></a>. A week later I was suddenly an investigative journalist keeping pace with the country’s premier tech publication on a technology story. This is where the point of this piece comes into focus. I had a previously scheduled interview <strong>that day</strong> for Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast to talk about <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/here-are-the-30-000-pages-of-federal-reserve-board-meeting-minutes-i-got-through-foia/\"><u>my 18 month effort</u></a> to FOIA the Federal Reserve.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, I wasn’t going to be talking about FOIA.<u> </u><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2025-02-05/bureau-of-the-fiscal-service-the-payment-system-elon-musk-has-access-to?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>I talked about the Bureau of Fiscal Servic</u></a>e and DOGE. But I had an agenda in mind. To understand that agenda, readers need to understand an extremely prescient newsletter from Odd Lots Co-Host Joe Weisenthal.</p><p>That November 7th piece, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-07/beware-the-stock-market-vigilantes?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NDA5NjI0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ0NzAxMDQ1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTTUw5TUdUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI1RTg4QjY1RTZBMjI0OTEzQThERDA1QjBEOEI5M0NBOCJ9.tXYTH_7vJTnCwKwsVikTZT0MLP0-BC0M9M2qHGFhkbQ&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>entitled “Beware The Stock Market Vigilantes”</u></a>, is worth excerpting at great length:</p><blockquote>When the stock market is down, people feel bad. When it’s up people feel good. If you’re an American politician (or President specifically), <strong>you’re forced to be sensitive to this in a very direct way if you want to be elected</strong>. It’s not really the same with bonds. The policy-markets nexus is just tighter with stocks.</blockquote><blockquote>Furthermore, because the stock market is how people fund their retirements (even for public employees with access to some kind of pension), pay for college, and so on, <strong>there’s arguably a limit to how long the American economic system can go without a rising stock market</strong></blockquote><blockquote>I think this gets operationalized in all kinds of notable ways:</blockquote><blockquote>This<strong> probably puts a constraint on populist, anti-market interventions</strong>. You saw this when the trade war with China started heating up under the first Trump administration, and there were days when the market’s reaction was sharply negative to the headlines. Those tariffs didn’t have a massive economic impact, and they didn’t have a massive market impact. <strong>But it seems reasonable to think about what a much more aggressive tariff regime would have on equities.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>There’s also a constraint that<strong> emerges when thinking about re-industrialization efforts </strong>(efforts whose future is ambiguous under the next administration). The idea of investing more domestically in factories etc. sounds nice to a lot of people. But it’s a very costly process, with uncertain returns. Technological leadership is also not one-off thing that you just achieve one day. It’s a constant process of risky investment, which (if you don’t have a monopoly) keeps pushing profits further out into the future.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>[...]</blockquote><blockquote>Anyway, to <strong>some extent this is just all theoretical talk right now.</strong> The stock market is at all time highs and surged since the election.<strong> So there’s no immediate source of concern here. For now this is not a source of pressure on the incoming Trump administration.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>But I think it’s helpful when thinking about the<strong> range of future economic possibilities</strong> (with respect to trade policy, with respect to Fed personnel decisions, and so forth) to think about the <strong>power of the stock market in limiting, or putting a curb on, some of these outcomes. </strong>[Emphasis added]</blockquote><p>I think the prescience speaks for itself. The main relevant quibble I had when I read it last November was I thought the piece conveyed an impression that politicians <strong>had</strong> to react to stock market moves. I argued, among <a href=\"https://x.com/NathanTankus/status/1854582974823469526?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>other things, that</u></a> “governments react to stock market moves because they are socialized to see them as important.” Obviously, that claim is being put to the test right now.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Anyway, when I walked into Bloomberg’s headquarters Tuesday, February 4th I had this newsletter from Joe at the top of my mind. I desperately wanted to get Marko Elez out of the Bureau of Fiscal Service and I was going to muster any resource I could. So I did my best to call up some “Stock Market Vigilantes”. My hope was that a big stock market reaction that was clearly attributable to news of DOGE’s unvarnished access to the Treasury payments system could greatly increase the pressure on them to back off.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the interview, when Tracy Alloway asked me what could go wrong from DOGE mucking about in this system, I took direct aim at waking <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2025-02-05/bureau-of-the-fiscal-service-the-payment-system-elon-musk-has-access-to?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>up some “heroic” stock market vigilantes</u></a>:</p><blockquote>There's no way to exaggerate how enormously dangerous this is.<strong> Every financial market in the world, in the country, in the world should be pricing in</strong> the operational failure uncertainties of this system. Every single financial market should be pricing it in, <strong>and none of them are. None of them are even close.</strong></blockquote><p>With the background context, it should be pretty obvious to readers that I was taking direct aim at the stock market. Really, I was taking direct aim at every financial market. Importantly, I wasn’t trying to “manipulate them”, at least not with false information. I was trying to get financial market participants to recognize the threat posed by a failure of the treasury’s payments system. “Pricing in” the potential for the treasury payments system to fail would mean higher interest rates for Treasury securities and far lower stock prices, among many other things. If the treasury fails, profits will be decimated. Indeed, a failure bad enough would make it an open question of whether the United States dollar would continue to <strong>exist.</strong> I wanted it to be priced into financial markets, so that it would go away.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/support\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Tip!</a></div><p>Now this is all less serious than it might sound because I knew, and Tracy and Joe knew, that it was exceedingly unlikely that financial markets would price in these uncertainties. In fact, Joe says as much in the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2025-02-05/bureau-of-the-fiscal-service-the-payment-system-elon-musk-has-access-to?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>epilogue of the interview</u></a>:</p><blockquote>[T]he market will freak out <strong>when something happens</strong>.

Here's my address: bc1qegxarzsfga9ycesfa7wm77sqmuqqv7083c6ss6\n\nDespite the multitude of payment system related reporting I need to bring to readers, much of which is already written, I’m actually going to start my renewed coverage with the most recent news: the Tariffs. \n\nThis is for a few reasons. For one thing, the stock crash late last week was absolutely enormous. The one day and two day crashes are only comparable to Covid, the 2008 Great Financial Crisis crashes and the 1987 stock market crash. Before putting the finishing touches on this piece and going to bed, I watched Bloomberg news from midnight to 1:30 AM and these comparisons were repeated over and over. At 1:00 AM a Bloomberg anchor summarized the situation by saying \"Carnage, panic, bloodbath does not even cover it\". Meanwhile, the crash last week is not over, it only paused for the weekend. As of this writing, the stock market “futures” markets are already crashing. John Authers in his Bloomberg newsletter reported at 1:00 AM “If the 4.8% fall in S&P 500 futures at the Asian opening isn’t reversed, then it’s on course for its worst three-day selloff since the Black Monday crash of October 1987.” This is, to say the least, not a good sign.\n\nBut let's back up to the very basics to explain what any of this stuff even means. Bear with me as I (briefly!!) start at the very beginning. First things first: “stock markets” are not just abstractions to talk vaguely about capitalism, large corporations or the wealthy. Stock markets are actual, concrete institutions. The main stock market in the United States, the New York Stock Exchange, is reputed to have informally begun as what today would be called a “cartel” of 24 stock market brokers organized by the “Buttonwood Agreement” on May 17th 1792. The New York Stock Exchange’s website neatly summarizes subsequent developments: \n\nIn the Exchange’s early years, stock trading continued on an informal basis in nearby coffeehouses where merchants typically gathered. By 1817, the stock market was active enough to encourage the brokers to create a formal organization. A constitution was adopted on March 8, 1817, creating the New York Stock & Exchange Board, the forerunner of today’s NYSE. From the beginning, regulations governed trading.\n\nThis is the very meaning of “market open” and “market close”. The New York Stock Exchange literally has an opening time— 9:30 AM— and a closing time— 4:00 PM Est. The other major U.S. stock exchange is the “Nasdaq”, which follows the New York Stock Exchange’s opening and closing time. \n\nSubscribe\n\nSo that’s stock market basics. But wait: what are “S&P 500 futures”, and what do they have to do with the stock market and how are they already trading if U.S. stock markets don’t open until 9:30 AM? Those of you who are invested in the stock market (sorry!) probably have some idea what the “S&P 500” actually means. A company called the “Standard & Poors Company” publishes an index of the 500 “largest” stocks”. “Largest” in this context means the total “market value” of all the stocks that company issues. Index funds in turn list something called “Exchange Traded Funds” which track the indices produced by “index providers”. I know this has gotten complicated fast, but the only way out is through.\n\nTo summarize, some entities publish indices saying “hey I’m summarizing what’s going on with all stocks, or a certain type of stocks, with this one number! If it goes up, good! If it goes down, bad!” and index funds come along and say “oh great! We’ll sell people a product that’s whole job is just tracking your index and we’ll pay you a fee for using your intellectual property [yes, really]. We’ll charge our customers a little fee for buying and selling assets to make sure our holdings follow your index!” In this way, individual financial products are produced which “encapsulate” what’s going on with the stock market. \n\nIntrepid entrepreneurs started approaching stock exchanges around the world and going “hey, wouldn’t it be great to have a guess at what’s happening with U.S. stocks when your markets are open and U.S. markets are closed?”. You may have heard the term “derivatives”. It may sound scary but at the most basic level, the concept is simple. A financial derivative is just a type of financial asset that’s value is “derived from” or “derivative” of another financial asset. In the case of “futures markets”, what they trade are contracts which promise to deliver another asset at a specified date. \n\nBringing this all together, the phrase “4.8% fall in S&P 500 futures” means that contracts which promise to deliver Standard & Poor 500 tracked “Exchange Traded Funds” (ETFs) issued by index funds went down in value by 4.8%. The “on Asian stock markets” part of John Authers sentence references that the S&P futures contracts he was looking at were trading on stock exchanges in Asia.  The Japanese stock market, for example, opens at 8 PM Est. the “previous day”. These interlocking exchange listed financial products provide a way of speculating on gaining insight into the behavior of U.S. stocks before the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq open.\n\nSubscribe\n\nI’ll have way more to say about stock & commodity exchanges —and index funds—in the future and have been meaning to write way more about them for a long while. A paper I co-wrote with Luke Herrine, who is now a law professor at the University of Alabama, in 2021 has an extended discussion of commodity and stock exchanges. That paper was published the following year as a chapter in the “Cambridge Handbook of Labour & Competition Law”. I also wrote a piece in September 2020 entitled: “The Stock Market Is Less Disconnected From the ‘Real Economy’ Than You Think: Stock Market Indices Aren't The Stock Market” —well worth reading in this context.\n\nIn my description above, I skipped over a crucial bit: Standard & Poors using the total value of a company’s stock as a basis for including companies means that stocks which skyrocket in value in a relatively short period of time may skyrocket their way into these indices. What happens then? This is no hypothetical. In December 2020 I had a guest piece by three European economists, Johannes Petry, Jan Fichtner & Eelke Heemskerk, which opened with an example which reads even more extraordinary and prescient than it did at the time:\n\nOver the course of 2020, Elon Musk’s wealth skyrocketed from $27.7 billion to $147 billion. Musk even overtook Bill Gates, to become the second richest person in the world. This was a tremendous jump in fortune: Musk was only at 36th place in January 2020. Musk’s enrichment was mainly due to Tesla’s rising stock price (TSLA:US), which surged from $86 in January to $650 in December. Tesla is currently one of the ten most valuable companies in the US stock market.\n\nIn an already record-breaking year, Tesla’s largest and most rapid increase in valuation came in November, due to its announced inclusion into the S&P 500 index, now scheduled for 21 December 2020. Within a week of this announcement, Tesla’s share price rose by 33%, as passive funds now have to invest more than $70 billion. This was a remarkable boost for stock of a company that many analysts say is already obviously overvalued.\n\nIn a very real sense, Donald Trump may have become president and Elon Musk may have taken the reins over the key infrastructure in the federal government, setting off the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis, simply because index funds exist and the 2020 jump in Tesla’s stock price led to Tesla’s inclusion in indices like the S&P 500. Try not to think about it too much.\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nFinally, Some Actual Tariff Commentary\n\nBy now I’m sure some readers are impatient for some actual tariff talk in this piece that’s allegedly about Trump’s tariffs. Here’s the tariff talk you’re looking for. As readers know, tariffs have been a constant topic for months. Since the first week of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis I’ve been asked over and over about tariffs. My informal answer has been that the tariff news, as important as it was, was so much less important than what was happening in the payments system that it was not worth taking time to cover. This was especially the case since plenty of people were covering tariffs—but vanishingly few are covering the payments issues. That’s in large part because so few people who write week to week news coverage understand these complex and understudied payments issues.\n\nI still think, as insane and dangerous as these tariffs are, that the tariff story is still less important and less dangerous than what is happening on the payment system side of the Trump administration’s chaos. \n\nTalking about tariffs is worth it just to make this bold claim because I’m sure for many readers it will make my concerns about the payments system concrete. Hopefully this will serve as a measure for readers to evaluate how enormously alarmed the payment system issues make me (and the experts I talk to) two months on. Tomorrow I will have another piece discussing why the stock market is crashing now—but hasn’t crashed over the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis (yet!)\n\nOn the tariffs themselves, the issues are pretty straightforward to me. Longtime Notes on the Crises readers know that one of my earliest and most persistent concerns during the onset of the Covid depression was that, despite the rapid decline of economic activity, there were going to be large economic dislocations because of supply chain disruptions. This meant there was a challenge between increasing demand for the specific goods and services people needed in the pandemic, especially those laid off and living on unemployment benefits, versus making sure supply chains could keep pace. \n\nSubscribe\n\nRather than talk about these issues in terms of “supply and demand”, my focus has always been the interdependent set of economic activities that keep a global economy going. Once you consider how reliant any individual area of economic activity is on every other part of economic activity through an incredibly complex web of inputs and outputs, it becomes more difficult to believe that there is something called “supply” which is conceptually independent or coherently separable from something called “demand”. \n\nWhat does this all have to do with tariffs? Well, the Trump tariffs are remarkable because of the combination of the way they are being introduced, as well as the extremity of the tariffs (or more frankly: insanity). They were literally generated by an AI chatbot which was asked for an “easy” way to calculate tariff rates. The Washington Post reported that the “AI chatbot” option was personally chosen by Trump less than three hours before Trump went onto the White House’s Rose Garden to announce the tariffs. In essence, his “Liberation day” Tariffs have created a supply chain crisis for the United States comparable in speed and scale to the global pandemic which shut down the world five years ago. It’s important to step back and process that statement and just how remarkable it is.  \n\nIt is remarkable because what we are talking about is not an external event or a biological or environmental disaster. It is the straightforward consequence of Donald Trump’s election, who was quite clear that he would be imposing sweeping tariffs in the wider context of sweeping promises of erratic vengeance on his enemies during a second term. As a rule, neither recessions or booms are the result of the individual preferences or predilections of individual presidents. Trump is breaking this rule, just like he’s broken so many others.\n\nNearly five years ago I published a piece in this newsletter entitled “What are the Three Concurrent Crises of the Coronavirus Depression? The Keynes Crisis, The Minsky Crisis and the Means Crisis”. The “Means crisis”, named after the economist Gardiner Means, was the physical allocation of goods and services and the need for their rapid reorganization. This was inspired both by Gardiner Means’ theoretical work and his practical work at the New Deal era agency “The National Resources Planning Board”. It is worth quoting my description of the importance and implications of a Means crisis:\n\nExisting prices and existing patterns of production and consumption can be sustained relatively easily by private action. However, profit-seeking businesses are bad at reallocating resources in response to crises. The uncertainty of how long the crisis will last and whether the costs of retooling plants and restructuring supply chains can be recouped discourages bold action. It is often perceived to be cheaper to simply leave productive resources unused than go through such expenses and uncertainties. Even farms are letting crops rot and euthanizing animals rather than trying to find ways to reorganize their supply chains. What Means work teaches us is that the government should step into this breach. It should be directly physically reallocating resources and organizing production through hiring workers and guaranteeing private producers markets. Resources left unplanned, are predictably unorganized. Private Sector planning works at dealing with medium and long term resource questions but struggles to move quickly and effectively in times of crisis. [emphasis added]\n\nOf course, in our current circumstances a chaotic and destructive government is the crisis. So that can’t be a solution. Collective action from ordinary people (or elites) is needed to first force the Federal Government to roll back its destructive policies. Then we need collective action to defeat this government entirely. Necessity, however, should not be confused with likelihood. \n\nSubscribe\n\nTo make this discussion concrete, the stated intention of Trump’s tariffs is to lead to higher domestic production of “tradable” goods and services. As Trump said on “National Liberation Day” (I’ve uploaded a pdf of a transcript of his remarks to my website for ease of access and posterity):\n\nWith today’s action, we are finally going to be able to make America great again, greater than ever before. Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country, and you see it happening already. We will supercharge our domestic industrial base. We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers.\n\nThis can work in two ways. First: multinational corporations can decide to shut down production plants abroad and shift production domestically. This requires lots of upfront economic resources. Put simply, it takes large expenditures of money to buy production inputs and hire labor to build new factories. Meanwhile, building new factories takes time.  Specifically, it takes years.\n\nThe second way, on the surface, seems more straightforward. This is called “expenditure switching”. In simpler terms, businesses and households choose to buy the same goods and services they would buy from other countries from existing domestic sellers. In this vision, underutilized capacity gets utilized. Trump doesn’t seem to be putting much stock in this option. In his Rose Garden remarks Trump said:\n\nBut what you’re going to see is you’re going to see activity that empty dead sites, factories that are falling down. Those factories will be knocked down, and they’re going to have brand new factories built in their place. They’re not only talking about renovating, they’re talking about brand new, the best anywhere in the world, the biggest anywhere in the world\n\nWhether a new factory is being built because a company is shutting down production abroad or simply expanding production domestically, it still involves a lot of upfront economic resources. \n\nA lot of people have been praising the merits of free trade in response to Trump’s tariff actions. This is understandable, but misses the point. None of this has anything to do with protectionism. It’s about exercising crude, coercive power abroad just like the Trump-Musk Payments crisis has been doing domestically. An industrial policy strategy aimed to develop domestic manufacturing would be focusing on a handful of higher value products. It would probably focus on high value final products i.e. those sold to consumers. Maybe a few key industrial inputs. They would also likely focus on just a few countries.\n\nSubscribe\n\nInstead, Trump’s tariffs are targeting the entire world; Including uninhabited islands of Penguins. They are also targeting all products, including a sweeping list of agricultural products that we will largely not be producing in the United States under any circumstances. The closest comparison we have for these tariffs in U.S. history are the 1828 tariffs that were branded “the Tariff of Abominations”. Trump’s tariffs make those nearly two century old tariffs look like one of the most brilliant development strategies ever undertaken.\n\nThe upshot of all this is that it would not be hard to imagine 6 or 8 industries advancing now that they can either charge higher prices or gain market share at the expense of foreign businesses. Instead, economic uncertainty is exploding and nearly every business in the country has no idea how much their costs will rise, how far their sales will fall or if they will even be able to get new inputs. It's not just that the costs of a business’s inputs are being tariffed at the same time that a business's industry is receiving “tariff protection”. It's also that a whole series of domestically produced inputs are also impacted by tariffs to an extent that you can’t predict. Will your costs go up 20%, 70% or 120%? You do not know. What are the impacts on your costs from all the businesses six degrees separated from you raising prices because of the tariffs they are experiencing?\n\nThis is the supply chain problem I was talking about. Tariffs have been slapped, to an unpredictable degree, all across the supply chain and it will take months to sort out the impact if they don’t get rolled back. Months of businesses and households waiting around and avoiding expenditures to learn more about what will happen are the months that will sink the global economy. To the extent president Donald Trump has really thought about any of this, he clearly is having some version of the thought process “tariffs are good, they will bring manufacturing back, more tariffs implemented more quickly will bring manufacturing back faster and bigger”. Instead he has set off thousands of sudden physical resource allocation problems, cost problems and more. \n\nWho in their right mind would commit to large scale projects building brand new U.S. factories right now? Especially since the escalating sense of chaos opens up the possibility that the tariffs will be moved back down and you’re now caught making investment decisions based on numbers written on an Etch-a-sketch. And indeed, that’s exactly what we’re seeing. Trump wants a manufacturing boom and instead he’s stoking a global recession and causing supply chain paralysis. It's truly amazing to witness.\n\nSubscribe\n\nWhich leads to the final point. What truly makes this crisis remarkable is it’s hard to see what will come to the rescue. In 2008 and 2020, central banks cut interest rates and deployed large programs. Congress passed the CARES act in 2020. Republicans are currently in a strong austerity mood- that’s a major part of the ideological background for the entire Impoundments crisis. Meanwhile Fed chairman Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve are skittish from all the criticism they faced for not raising interest rates “soon enough” after 2021. This is worsened by the fact that the price increases that will come with the tariffs dissuade strong Federal Reserve action. Put simply, the Fed will be extraordinarily reluctant to cut rates if they expect “persistent inflation” from here on out. More fundamentally, monetary policy simply does not have the tools- even with extremely audacious use of the Federal Reserve’s “emergency” authority- to patch up the results of an out of control executive branch unconstitutionally creating volatile “discretionary” fiscal policy tools for itself. \n\nAt the time of this writing at 2:00 AM Est., the consensus of financial commentators seems to agree with me. So do financial traders who are betting on remarkably small interest rate cuts relative to the scale of the economic calamity their stock market bets illustrate.\n\nThe good news is that there are signs that business elites in this country are finally turning on Trump as a result of all this. With one of the greatest stock market crashes in world history, the odds of American democracy surviving Donald Trump and Elon Musk have gone up. If only it didn’t cost so much. More on this, tomorrow.\n\n\n\n","html":"<p></p><p>Hello readers, apologies for my extended absence.

For one thing, the stock crash late last week was<strong> absolutely enormous</strong>. The one day and two day crashes are only comparable to Covid, the 2008 Great Financial Crisis crashes and the 1987 stock market crash. Before putting the finishing touches on this piece and going to bed, I watched Bloomberg news from midnight to 1:30 AM and these comparisons were repeated over and over. At 1:00 AM a Bloomberg anchor summarized the situation by saying \"Carnage, panic, bloodbath does not even cover it\". Meanwhile, the crash last week <strong>is not over, it only paused for the weekend</strong>. As of this writing, the stock market “futures” markets are already crashing. John Authers in his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-04-07/there-s-no-sign-that-markets-have-had-enough-yet?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Bloomberg newsletter reported</u></a> at 1:00 AM “If the 4.8% fall in S&amp;P 500 futures at the Asian opening isn’t reversed, then it’s on course for its worst three-day selloff since the Black Monday crash of October 1987.”&nbsp;This is, to say the least, not a good sign.</p><p>But let's back up to the very basics to explain what any of this stuff even means. Bear with me as I (briefly!!) start at the very beginning. First things first: “stock markets” are not just abstractions to talk vaguely about capitalism, large corporations or the wealthy. Stock markets are actual, concrete<strong> institutions.</strong> The main stock market in the United States, the New York Stock Exchange, is reputed to have informally begun as what today would be called a “cartel” of 24 stock market brokers organized by the “Buttonwood Agreement” on May 17th 1792. The<a href=\"https://www.nyse.com/history-of-nyse?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> New York Stock Exchange’s website</u></a> neatly summarizes subsequent developments:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>In the Exchange’s early years, stock trading continued on an informal basis in nearby coffeehouses where merchants typically gathered. By 1817, the stock market was active enough to encourage the brokers to create a formal organization. A constitution was adopted on March 8, 1817, creating the New York Stock &amp; Exchange Board, the forerunner of today’s NYSE. <strong>From the beginning, regulations governed trading.</strong></blockquote><p>This is the very meaning of “market open” and “market close”. The New York Stock Exchange <strong>literally</strong> has an opening time— 9:30 AM— and a closing time— 4:00 PM Est. The other major U.S. stock exchange is the “Nasdaq”, which follows the New York Stock Exchange’s opening and closing time.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>So that’s stock market basics. But wait: what are “S&amp;P 500 futures”, and what do they have to do with the stock market and how are they already trading if U.S. stock markets don’t open until 9:30 AM? Those of you who are invested in the stock market (sorry!) probably have some idea what the “S&amp;P 500” actually means. A company called the “Standard &amp; Poors Company” publishes an index of the 500 “largest” stocks”. “Largest” in this context means the total “market value” of all the stocks that company issues. Index funds in turn list something called “Exchange Traded Funds” which track the indices produced by “index providers”. I know this has gotten complicated fast, but the only way out is through.</p><p>To summarize, some entities publish indices saying “hey I’m summarizing what’s going on with all stocks, or a certain type of stocks, with this one number! If it goes up, good! If it goes down, bad!” and index funds come along and say “oh great! We’ll sell people a product that’s whole job is just tracking your index and we’ll pay you a fee for using your intellectual property [yes, really]. We’ll charge our customers a little fee for buying and selling assets to make sure our holdings follow your index!” In this way, individual financial products are produced which “encapsulate” what’s going on with the stock market.&nbsp;</p><p>Intrepid entrepreneurs started approaching stock exchanges around the world and going “hey, wouldn’t it be great to have a guess at what’s happening with U.S. stocks when your markets are open and U.S. markets are closed?”. You may have heard the term “derivatives”. It may sound scary but at the most basic level, the concept is simple. A financial derivative is just a type of financial asset that’s value is “derived from” or “derivative” of another financial asset. In the case of “futures markets”, what they trade are contracts which promise to deliver another asset at a specified date.&nbsp;</p><p>Bringing this all together, the phrase “4.8% fall in S&amp;P 500 futures” means that contracts which promise to deliver Standard &amp; Poor 500 tracked “Exchange Traded Funds” (ETFs) issued by index funds went down in value by 4.8%. The “on Asian stock markets” part of John Authers sentence references that the S&amp;P futures contracts he was looking at were trading on stock exchanges in Asia.&nbsp; The Japanese stock market, for example, opens at 8 PM Est. the “previous day”. These interlocking exchange listed financial products provide a way of <s>speculating on</s> gaining insight into the behavior of U.S. stocks before the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq open.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>I’ll have way more to say about stock &amp; commodity exchanges&nbsp;—and index funds—in the future and have been meaning to write way more about them for a long while. A paper I co-wrote with Luke Herrine, who is now a <a href=\"https://law.ua.edu/faculty_staff/luke-herrine/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>law professor at the University of Alabama</u></a>, in 2021 has an extended discussion of <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/04/Tankus-2022.-Competition-Law-as-Collective-Bargaining-Law.pdf\"><u>commodity and stock exchanges</u></a>. That paper was published the following year as a chapter in the <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-labor-in-competition-law/DA27B8F42F54C30605087123FD6F6E72?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“Cambridge Handbook of Labour &amp; Competition Law”</u></a>. I also <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-less-disconnected/\"><u>wrote a piece in September 2020 entitled</u></a>: “The Stock Market Is Less Disconnected From the ‘Real Economy’ Than You Think: Stock Market Indices Aren't The Stock Market” —well worth reading in this context.</p><p>In my description above, I skipped over a crucial bit: Standard &amp; Poors using the total value of a company’s stock as a basis for including companies means that stocks which skyrocket in value in a relatively short period of time may skyrocket their way into these indices. What happens then? This is no hypothetical. In December 2020 <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/its-the-index-stupid-our-new-not/\"><u>I had a guest piece by three European economists</u></a>, <a href=\"https://johannespetry.com/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Johannes Petry</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.jfichtner.net/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Jan Fichtner</u></a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.eelkeheemskerk.nl/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Eelke Heemskerk</u></a>, which opened with an example which reads even more extraordinary and prescient than it did at the time:</p><blockquote>Over the course of 2020,<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/elon-r-musk/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> Elon Musk’s wealth skyrocketed from $27.7 billion to $147 billion</a>. Musk even overtook Bill Gates, to become the second richest person in the world. This was a tremendous jump in fortune: Musk was only at 36th place in January 2020. Musk’s enrichment was mainly due to Tesla’s rising stock price (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US?ref=crisesnotes.com\">TSLA:US</a>), which surged from $86 in January to $650 in December. Tesla is currently one of the ten most valuable companies in the US stock market.</blockquote><blockquote>In an already record-breaking year, Tesla’s largest and most rapid increase in valuation came in November, due to its announced inclusion into the S&amp;P 500 index, now scheduled for 21 December 2020. Within a week of this announcement,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/24/elon-musk-bill-gates-tesla-share-price-microsoft?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> Tesla’s share price rose by 33%</a>, as passive funds now have to invest<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/sps-decision-to-a-tesla-demonstrates-the-power-of-passive-investing.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> more than $70 billion</a>.

Here’s the tariff talk you’re looking for. As readers know, tariffs have been a constant topic for months. Since the first week of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis I’ve been asked over and over about tariffs. My informal answer has been that the tariff news, as important as it was, was <strong>so much</strong> <strong>less important</strong> than what was happening in the payments system that it was not worth taking time to cover. This was especially the case since plenty of people were covering tariffs—but vanishingly few are covering the payments issues. That’s in large part because so few people who write week to week news coverage understand these complex and understudied payments issues.</p><p><strong>I still think, as insane and dangerous as these tariffs are, that the tariff story is still less important and less dangerous than what is happening on the payment system side of the Trump administration’s chaos.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about tariffs is worth it just to make this <strong>bold claim </strong>because I’m sure for many readers it will make my concerns about the payments system concrete. Hopefully this will serve as a measure for readers to evaluate how enormously alarmed the payment system issues make me (and the experts I talk to) two months on. Tomorrow I will have another piece discussing why the stock market is crashing now—but <strong>hasn’t </strong>crashed over the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis (yet!)</p><p>On the tariffs themselves, the issues are pretty straightforward to me. Longtime <strong><em>Notes on the Crises</em></strong> readers know that one of my earliest and most persistent concerns during the onset of the Covid depression was that, despite the rapid decline of economic activity, there were going to be large economic dislocations because of supply chain disruptions. This meant there was a challenge between<strong> increasing demand for the specific goods and services</strong> people needed in the pandemic, especially those laid off and living on unemployment benefits, versus <strong>making sure supply chains could keep pace.&nbsp;</strong></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Rather than talk about these issues in terms of “supply and demand”, my focus has always been the interdependent set of economic activities that keep a global economy going. Once you consider how reliant any individual area of economic activity is on every other part of economic activity through an incredibly complex web of inputs and outputs, it becomes <strong>more difficult to believe</strong> that there is something called “supply” which is conceptually independent or coherently separable from something called “demand”.&nbsp;</p><p>What does this all have to do with tariffs? Well, the Trump tariffs are remarkable because of the combination of the way they are being introduced, as well as the extremity of the tariffs (or more frankly: insanity). They <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/642620/trump-tariffs-formula-ai-chatgpt-gemini-claude-grok?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>were literally generated by an AI chatbot</u></a> which was asked for an “easy” way to calculate tariff rates. The Washington Post<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/04/trump-tariffs-reason-advisers/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> reported that the “AI chatbot” option was personally chosen by Trump</u></a> less than three hours before Trump went onto the White House’s Rose Garden to announce the tariffs. In essence, <strong>his “Liberation day” Tariffs have created a supply chain crisis for the United States comparable in speed and scale to the global pandemic which shut down the world five years ago</strong>. It’s important to step back and process that statement and just how remarkable it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It is remarkable because what we are talking about is not an external event or a biological or environmental disaster. </strong>It is the straightforward consequence of Donald Trump’s election, who was quite clear that he would be imposing <strong>sweeping tariffs</strong> in the wider context of sweeping promises of <strong>erratic vengeance</strong> on his enemies during a second term. As a rule, neither recessions or booms are the result of the individual preferences or predilections of individual presidents. <strong>Trump is breaking this rule</strong>, just like he’s broken so many others.</p><p>Nearly five years ago I published a piece in this newsletter entitled <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/what-are-the-three-concurrent-crises/\"><u>“What are the Three Concurrent Crises of the Coronavirus Depression? The Keynes Crisis, The Minsky Crisis and the Means Crisis”</u></a>. The “Means crisis”, named after the economist Gardiner Means, was the physical allocation of goods and services and the need for their rapid reorganization. This was inspired both by Gardiner Means’ theoretical work and his practical work at the New Deal era agency “The National Resources Planning Board”. It is worth quoting my description of the importance and implications of a Means crisis:</p><blockquote>Existing prices and existing patterns of production and consumption can be sustained relatively easily by private action. However, <strong>profit-seeking businesses are bad at reallocating resources in response to crises</strong>. The uncertainty of how long the crisis will last and whether the costs of retooling plants and restructuring supply chains can be recouped <strong>discourages bold action</strong>. It is often perceived to be<strong> cheaper to simply leave productive resources unused than go through such expenses and uncertainties</strong>. Even farms are letting crops rot and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/coronavirus-farmers-killing-pigs.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>euthanizing animals</u></a> rather than trying to find ways to reorganize their supply chains. What Means work teaches us is that the government should step into this breach. It should be directly physically reallocating resources and organizing production through hiring workers and guaranteeing private producers markets. Resources left unplanned, are predictably unorganized. <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00213624.1983.11504181?journalCode=mjei20&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Private Sector planning</u></a> works at dealing with medium and long term resource questions but <strong>struggles to move quickly and effectively in times of crisis.</strong> [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>Of course, in our current circumstances a <strong>chaotic and destructive government</strong> <strong><em>is</em> the crisis. </strong>So that <strong>can’t be a <em>solution</em></strong>. Collective action from ordinary people (or elites) is needed to first force the Federal Government to roll back its destructive policies. Then we need collective action to defeat this government entirely. Necessity, however, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/04/trump-tariffs-fear-lobby-business-congress-00006608?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>should not be confused with likelihood</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>To make this discussion concrete, the stated intention of Trump’s tariffs is to lead to higher domestic production of “tradable” goods and services. As Trump said on “National Liberation Day” (I’ve <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/04/April-2nd-2025-National-Liberation-Day-Trump-transcript.pdf\"><u>uploaded a pdf of a transcript of his remarks to my website</u></a> for ease of access and posterity):</p><blockquote>With today’s action, we are finally going to be able to make America great again, greater than ever before. <strong>Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country, and you see it happening already.</strong> We will supercharge our domestic industrial base. We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers.</blockquote><p>This can work in two ways. First: <strong>multinational corporations can decide to shut down production plants</strong> abroad and shift production domestically. This requires lots of upfront economic resources. Put simply, it takes large expenditures of money to buy production inputs and hire labor to build new factories. Meanwhile, building new factories takes time.&nbsp; Specifically, it takes <strong>years</strong>.</p><p>The second way, on the surface, seems more straightforward. This<strong> </strong>is called<strong> “expenditure switching”.</strong> In simpler terms, businesses and households choose to buy the same goods and services they would buy from other countries from existing domestic sellers. In this vision, underutilized capacity gets utilized. Trump doesn’t seem to be putting much stock in this option. In his Rose Garden <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/04/April-2nd-2025-National-Liberation-Day-Trump-transcript.pdf\"><u>remarks Trump said</u></a>:</p><blockquote>But what you’re going to see is you’re going to see activity that empty dead sites, factories that are falling down. <strong>Those factories will be knocked down, and they’re going to have brand new factories built in their place</strong>. They’re not only talking about renovating, they’re talking about brand new, the best anywhere in the world, the biggest anywhere in the world</blockquote><p>Whether a new factory is being built because a company is shutting down production abroad or simply expanding production domestically, it still involves a lot of upfront economic resources.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of people have been praising the merits of free trade in response to Trump’s tariff actions. This is understandable, but misses the point. None of this has anything to do with protectionism. It’s about exercising crude, coercive power abroad just like the Trump-Musk Payments crisis has been doing domestically. An industrial policy strategy aimed to develop domestic manufacturing would be focusing on a handful of higher value products. It would probably focus on high value <strong>final products</strong> i.e. those sold to consumers. Maybe a few key industrial inputs. They would also likely focus on just a few countries.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Instead, Trump’s tariffs are targeting the <strong>entire world</strong>; Including <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/06/politics/video/secretary-of-agriculture-brooke-rollins-tariffs-trump-digvid?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>uninhabited islands of Penguins</u></a>. They are also targeting all products, including a sweeping list of agricultural products that we will largely not be producing in the United States under any circumstances. The closest comparison we have for these tariffs in U.S. history are the 1828 tariffs that were branded <a href=\"https://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context=utk_graddiss&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“the Tariff of Abominations”</u></a>. Trump’s tariffs make those nearly two century old tariffs look like one of the most brilliant development strategies ever undertaken.</p><p>The upshot of all this is that it would not be hard to imagine 6 or 8 industries advancing now that they can either charge higher prices or gain market share at the expense of foreign businesses. Instead, <a href=\"https://www.apricitas.io/i/160233336/conclusions?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>economic uncertainty is exploding</u></a> and nearly every business in the country has no idea how much their costs will rise, how far their sales will fall or if they will even be able to get new inputs. It's not just that the costs of a business’s inputs are being tariffed at the same time that a business's industry is receiving “tariff protection”. It's also that a whole series of domestically produced inputs are also impacted by tariffs to an extent that you can’t predict. Will your costs go up 20%, 70% or 120%? You do not know. What are the impacts on your costs from all the businesses six degrees separated from you raising prices because of the tariffs they are experiencing? </p><p>This is the supply chain problem I was talking about. Tariffs have been slapped, to an unpredictable degree, all across the supply chain and it will take months to sort out the impact if they don’t get rolled back. Months of businesses and households waiting around and avoiding expenditures to learn more about what will happen are the months that will sink the global economy. To the extent president Donald Trump has really thought about any of this, he clearly is having some version of the thought process “tariffs are good, they will bring manufacturing back, more tariffs implemented more quickly will bring manufacturing back faster and bigger”. Instead he has set off thousands of sudden physical resource allocation problems, cost problems and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Who in their right mind would commit to large scale projects building brand new U.S. factories right now? Especially since the escalating sense of chaos opens up the possibility that the tariffs will be moved back down and you’re now caught making investment decisions based on numbers written on an Etch-a-sketch. And indeed, that’s exactly what we’re seeing. Trump wants a manufacturing boom and instead he’s stoking a global recession and causing supply chain paralysis. It's truly amazing to witness.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Which leads to the final point. What truly makes this crisis remarkable is it’s hard to see what will come to the rescue. In 2008 and 2020, central banks cut interest rates and deployed large programs. Congress passed the CARES act in 2020. Republicans are currently in a strong austerity mood- that’s a major part of the ideological background for the entire Impoundments crisis. Meanwhile Fed chairman Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve are skittish from all the criticism they faced for not raising interest rates “soon enough” after 2021. This is worsened by the fact that the price increases that will come with the tariffs <a href=\"https://prospect.org/economy/2023-08-01-jay-powells-federal-reserve-protection-bankers/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>dissuade strong Federal Reserve action</u></a>. Put simply, the Fed will be extraordinarily reluctant to cut rates if <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-transitory-inflation-debate-misses-the-point/\"><u>they expect “persistent inflation” from here on out</u></a>. More fundamentally, monetary policy simply does not have the tools- even with extremely audacious use of the Federal Reserve’s “emergency” authority- to patch up the results of an out of control executive branch unconstitutionally creating volatile “discretionary” fiscal policy tools for itself.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time of this writing at 2:00 AM Est., the consensus of financial commentators seems to agree with me.

Here's my address: bc1qegxarzsfga9ycesfa7wm77sqmuqqv7083c6ss6\n\nIn my last column in Rolling Stone 37 days ago, I explained that the constitutional crisis that Elon Musk and Donald Trump set off by refusing to spend what Congress ordered the executive branch to spend — a process known legally as “impoundment” — had taken an “inconceivably more dangerous” turn. Today I am again publishing a Rolling Stone article, alongside this more technical Notes on the Crises article, to finally reveal the results of two and a half weeks of exhaustive reporting on a different aspect of the ongoing Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis. Indeed, as a result of my reporting today, we can now simply call it the “Trump-Musk Payments Crisis.”\n\nOn February 11, 2025, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), an agency housed in the Department of Homeland Security, removed $80.5 million from New York City’s main bank account, which is an account with Citibank. Well, that’s not exactly accurate. They “debited”, the financial way of referring to “subtracting”, New York City’s “central treasury account” for 80.5 million dollars. According to public statements by Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller, this could only be covered by a line of credit facility to the tune of 79.5 million dollars. In short they, in essence, sent New York City’s main bank account to negative 79.5 million dollars. Citibank kindly agreed to forgive the overdraft fee. \n\nOn February 18th a FEMA branded letter authored by Cameron Hamilton, a person described in the letter as a “Senior Official Performing the Duties of the [FEMA] Administrator”, was sent to the New York City Office of Management and Budget. The letter explained that the money was “clawed back” because of a range of claims about illegal activity which the New York Post alleged took place in the hotels the city paid to put Venezuelan refugees in. I can’t really communicate to readers what this letter reads like, so I will simply quote an important paragraph to provide the “flavor”:\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has significant concerns that SSP funding is going to entities engaged in or facilitating illegal activities. For example, a substantial portion of your award goes to funding alien housing at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City. According to media reports, the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua has taken over the hotel and is using it as a recruiting center and base of operations to plan a variety of crimes. According to these same reports, these crimes include gun and drug sales as well as sex trafficking, which can reasonably be presumed to be conducted in the hotel itself. One of the groups responsible for these activities refer to themselves as “diablos de la 42,” which means the devils of 42nd St., a street near where the Roosevelt Hotel is located. DHS/FEMA has a responsibility to ensure that it does not make payments that fund criminal activity.\n\nThis justification for denying congressionally appropriated funds is extremely legally dubious. This justification for “reversing” the disbursement of already disbursed funds is far beyond legally dubious. It brings up profound and basic issues about the functioning of our society which I will unpack throughout the rest of this article.\n\n\n\nIn a number of ways, the most important element of this story is that it was clearly instigated by Elon Musk. At 5 am the day before the FEMA payments were “clawed back” by FEMA, Elon Musk tweeted:\n\nThe @DOGE team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants. \n\nSending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the President’s executive order. \n\nThat money is meant for American disaster relief and instead is being spent on high end hotels for illegals! \n\nA clawback demand will be made today to recoup those funds.\n\nIt does not take much of a leap in logic to draw a direct line between this “clawback” to Elon Musk. I must, however, leave this more political element to future reporting and stick to unraveling labyrinthine technical details.\n\nOne month ago, on February 12th, I emailed the New York City Comptroller’s office. I was very busy and I thought, since New York City Comptroller Brad Lander followed me on twitter, it was likely I would get contacted in response to my email (and associated phone call). For whatever reason, my email fell through the cracks as they were flooded by media requests after their press releases on this matter. I was busy, so I forgot about it. I, however, knew as soon as I saw the story that it was extremely important. On February 24th, I published an article written with the benefit of high level financial sources regarding technical banking system signs to look for impoundment- Presidential refusal to spend money congress has ordered spent- happening at scale. With that article published, I turned back to this topic and began investigating. \n\nI devoted so much time to this story because of the full implications it immediately brings to mind to any payments system expert. This is not simply about FEMA’s actions towards the city of New York’s bank accounts or even about large scale payments system level impoundment. This story is about the truly electrifying and terrifying question: can the Trump administration arbitrarily take money from anyone for any reason using control of the payments system? If it can’t, what exactly are the current limits to what the Trump administration can do and how easy is it to break those limits?\n\nTo understand why this case brings up such dramatic and mind-boggling questions readers must understand some things about the payments system they use every day without thinking about it. If you have ever gotten a direct deposit of pay, or really anything else, you have used a system called the Automatic Clearing House system or “ACH”. Social security payments are ACH payments, as are payments to medical providers. For older readers, if you look at your checkbook you will see an “ACH number” on your checks. Really, it would be easier to list what aren’t ACH payments than what are. \n\nWhen you make a credit card payment, technically speaking what you are doing is authorizing the credit card company to send an ACH “debit” to your bank account. This debit subtracts the money and when the payment clears, the credit card company “credits” your credit card account and lowers your credit card balance (which is a type of debt). In other words, what is subtracted from your credit card debt is what they subtracted from your bank account. Your assets and liabilities go down by the same amount (except for interest payments and fees of course).\n\nThe first Automated Clearing House in the United States was organized by the “Special Committee on Paperless Entries” (SCOPE), which was an association of California bankers, over the course of 1968 to 1972. The 30,000 pages of Federal Reserve Board Minutes I got through FOIA last year has some interesting previously unreleased material on the early formation of the first ACH network, whose day to day operation was technically run by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. SCOPE was renamed “California Automated Clearing House Association” (CACHA) and similar regional banker associations popped up across the country to form regional automated clearing houses. This led to the 1974 formation of the “National Automated Clearing House Association” (NACHA, now “Nacha”) which determines the rules for Automated Clearing Houses. The actual payments infrastructure is run by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks along with “The Clearing House”, a clearinghouse originally set up by large New York banks all the way back in 1853. \n\nThat is all a long and exhaustive way of saying that the Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment system is one of the foundational building blocks of all payments made in our society. Nearly every payment you make is either an ACH payment or it relies indirectly on accurate and timely ACH payments. Furthermore, any institution you rely on directly or indirectly relies on accurate and timely ACH payments to function properly. If the reliability of Automatic Clearing House payments were to be permanently or indefinitely degraded in a crucial manner, it would fundamentally threaten your access to basic social services, and even privately produced and distributed goods and services. To explain why, we have to understand a fundamental, yet neglected, area of law called “payment finality”.\n\nThe idea of “payment finality” is deceptively basic. What it refers to is the point at which a transaction is concluded by full and satisfactory payment. Contracts, for example, are a relationship between two parties. Those parties have a contract relationship for as long as the contract is outstanding. If I hire you to build me a cabinet, we are in a contractual relationship until you deliver a finished cabinet and I deliver your payment in full. If we meet at a street intersection and you deliver me the cabinet, once you receive final payment the transaction is complete.But what is the “final payment”?\n\nFor many centuries physical money was a dominant mode of “arm's length” payment so final payment was when physical money was handed over and safely in the possession of the recipient or “payee”. In fact, as York University law professor Benjamin Geva points out in his 2011 book “The Payment Order of Antiquity and the Middle Ages: A Legal History”, this is a common definition of money in legal history. The landmark English case Moss v Hancock defines money, in part, as “that which passes freely from hand to hand throughout the community in final discharge of debts”. In a very real sense then, money is that object, or system, that you can make final payment with.\n\nConsequently what defined physical objects as “currency” was that they could be universally proffered as final payment. Being a “legal tender” meant that you could provide them in final payment for an obligation. You could “legally tender” those objects. The idea of final payment is easier with “bearer instruments” like cash. A “bearer instrument” is just a type of financial instrument that is owned outright by whoever possesses it. A dollar bill is the only “bearer instrument” the vast majority of ordinary people interact with. The concept of final payment feels intuitive and straightforward with physical items that you hand over, which then become property of the recipient once you hand it over. We no longer live in the world of cash. We live in the world of accounts.\n\nIn the world of accounts, a disturbing question hangs over us: when is a payment truly final? Or as famous New York philosophers Yogi Berra and Lenny Kravitz might say \"It ain't over till it's over\". If, in theory, my account can always be subtracted from- if my account can always be “debited”- is a transaction ever really final? When there is an “operational” possibility the government, or any key actor in the payments system, can simply debit accounts payment, “finality” always has a hanging thread of doubt. Under our current technological and administrative arrangements, the only protection against this possibility is a layer of laws and norms which constrain — even asphyxiate — this distressing prospect. \n\n In other words, we socially and legally construct payment finality as “truth”. Yet the fabric of these social and legal constructions are far more fragile than most people imagine. Proposals, such as my colleague Rohan Grey’s proposal for a congressionally-issued digital fiat currency, are important because they aim to undergird payment finality with new technological and administrative arrangements that will provide much stronger protections against this kind of abuse, along with impoundment itself. But we can’t wait for what does not yet exist. We have to deal with what is happening now.\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nWhich brings me back to ACH. Given the complexity, and relative obscurity, of this area of law and the immense amount of reporting and research I already had to do for this story, I decided to commission a full length legal memo- similar to the legal memos a staff attorney at a financial regulatory agency or white shoe law firm might produce- on the “Federal Government Use of the Automated Clearing House System”. The attorney I commissioned, Ashley Burke, did an excellent job and I have uploaded “Notes on the Crises Legal Memorandum No. 1” to my website to make it widely available and free to anyone who is in need of detailed legal analysis in this suddenly crucial area of law. Ashley is, of course, not responsible for any of the claims I make in this article and can’t attest to the accuracy or reliability of my reporting. Nor can her memo be construed as legal advice. \n\nRecognizing the importance of payment finality, the National Automated Clearing House Association has promulgated rules in this area. Meanwhile, the laws congress has passed about ACH payments are broad and vague. However, as Ashley lays out in her legal memo, Nacha rules can and are currently superseded in a variety of ways by what is called “agency rulemaking”. Generally speaking, when congress passes laws that are subject to varying interpretations- and when is law not subject to varying interpretations?- administrative agencies engage in the “rulemaking” process to “interpret” the law for practical use by government, businesses, civil society and the world at large. \n\nThis “agency discretion” over interpreting the law is the core of the “administrative state” that right wing think tanks say they are aiming to destroy. Yet in this situation, they may begin to use discretion in interpreting payments law to fundamentally undermine the reliability of payment finality and capriciously “take back” or even “take” from groups and people they disfavor. Thus, there is nothing in payments law that provides a clear or unambiguous check on the Trump administration’s actions if they decide to reinterpret payment statutes in order to weaponize the Federal Government’s legal authority over the ACH system.\n\nIt is hard to explain how explosive degrading- let alone destroying- the legal reliability of payment finality is. Mark Flood, a research scholar at the Center for Financial Policy at University of Maryland with two decades of financial regulatory & policy experience in Federal Government tells me: \n\nUncertainty about payment finality has the potential to degrade insidiously the performance of the financial system. If there is generally a nonzero chance that even settled payments might be reversed, then the most liquid of assets (cash balances) could lose reliability and therefore value: $1 of 'cash in the bank' may no longer be regarded as worth $1.\n\nAlong similar lines, A former Federal Reserve Lawyer tells me:\n\nOur monetary system depends on a strong concept of payment finality. Exceptions must be reserved for only truly extraordinary cases. From what I understand of the facts of this case this is not an extraordinary situation. Reversing of final payments, in a stable financial system, should never be in the ordinary course of business”\n\nThese quotes may read as subtle to many lay readers. I can tell you that to payment experts- hell, as a payments expert- these quotes make our eyes widen with alarm. Part of what I have been trying to accomplish with my reporting these past six weeks is to serve as a translator for the panic many experts truly feel, but do not feel at liberty to express openly.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSo if the bank-based payment system or payments law is not a constraint, are there others? At first glance, it might seem like there are. Administrative agencies can’t just decide to debit accounts. They have to get payment reversals or separate debit transactions certified at a central point. Readers of Notes on the Crises or my previous Rolling Stone article are already dreading what they correctly suspect is coming next. The body that certifies debit transactions is… the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. With DOGE’s Thomas Krause as Fiscal Assistant Secretary, it is unlikely, to say the least, that the Bureau of the Fiscal Service will be blocking such requests from agencies (If you are a current or former Bureau of the Fiscal service employee familiar with the situation, please get into contact). A current Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee when told about the circumstances in this case replied \"who makes the decision [at BFS] to reverse [ACH payments] probably just bows to the king [Trump]”. \n\nA former BFS employee tells me:\n\nThe circumstances you describe from the FEMA-New York situation sound highly unusual. Payment finality except in extraordinary and clearly-defined circumstances are critical to a functioning and credible payment system.  Once a payment is finalized, agencies would normally need to use legal remedies outside the disbursement process to seek recovery of improper payments.\n\nThat last sentence is a key point. The objection here is not to using any legal mechanism to retrieve an “improper” payment. Of course it is, to say the least, very open to question that the Trump administration accurately identifies improper payments rather than disfavored payments. The objection informed observers have is to improperly using the payments system to recover payments which were settled because they contradict the current administration’s policies. The Trump administration’s, and Elon Musk’s, repeated misrepresentation and expanded definitions of “improper payments” fundamentally obscure this crucial distinction.\n\nPublic reporting already suggests that the New York City government is generally resistant to pursuing this issue in the manner required by its eye-popping seriousness. Over the course of reporting this article I have, on multiple occasions, encountered circumstances, circumstances that I’m not at liberty to discuss in more specific terms for reasons of journalistic ethics, which have reinforced that impression. Reasons for this could include fear of a larger confrontation with the Trump administration or specific fear that the Trump administration would revive Biden-era federal corruption charges against Mayor Adams that Trump’s Justice Department caused a firestorm by dropping, but with the possibility of refiling. Legal expert and former solicitor general under George W. Bush Paul Clement has advised federal district judge Dale E. Ho in Adams’ case that he should permanently dismiss the charges so they do not hang over Mayor Adams like “the proverbial Sword of Damocles”.\n\nIt is thus very important to these circumstances that the New York City Comptroller Brad Lander is an independently elected official who can advocate for the city’s interests, as well as the American people’s interests more generally, separately from Mayor Eric Adams. Brad Lander has put out public statements in the last month openly stating that his advocacy has compelled “reversals” of New York City government’s decisions in this matter.  On February 14th, for example, the comptroller office published an official Brad Lander statement saying:\n\nI was relieved to receive a reply from Corporation Counsel Muriel Goode-Trufant this afternoon, agreeing to commence legal action, no later than one week from today. I am grateful that our urgent insistence pushed the Law Department to pursue litigation, even at this precarious moment. I look forward to doing everything in my power to help the City recoup the FEMA funds stolen by President Trump and holding accountable those intent on working against the best interests of New Yorkers.\n\nIt is important in this context to explain that the NYC comptroller office deals with accounting. Managerial accounting is only interested in payments insofar as payment reconciliation is important for accurate accounting with adequate internal controls. \n\nSubscribe\n\nIn response to a request for comment Chloe Chik, spokesperson for the New York City Comptroller, says:\n\nWhile we cannot comment on the specifics due to ongoing litigation, as the City's Chief Financial Officer, the Comptroller's office has accounting oversight of the city's ledgers, including City bank account activities. Because of our role in monitoring the City's cash balances, the Comptroller's office was able to uncover the overdraft associated with the $80.5m clawback\n\nThis is important because the lawsuit in this area is a New York City lawsuit which the Comptroller’s office and its legal counsel are involved in, but do not have the final say over. The phrase “accounting oversight” is key because it means that the details of what went on, and goes on, on the ACH payments side is not in their purview. That is the New York City Finance department, which as of this writing could not be reached for comment. The intragovernmental conflict over this case in New York City concerns me because I worry that the most foundational legal issues may not be resolved, or even seriously litigated, in New York City’s lawsuit over this matter.\n\nOne of the reasons this story has been so difficult to report and has taken as long as it has is that it has been extremely difficult to find sources willing to be quoted, or really even vaguely characterized. To understand why, think of this topic from the point of view of a financial or payment expert (whether among lawyers or in other fields). Imagine you were such a person and you believed that the Trump administration was in the process of successfully claiming for itself the power to arbitrarily reverse any government payment or even, in the worst case scenarios, arbitrarily confiscate the funds in any person’s bank account without due process of law. Would you be willing to risk being targeted for giving a quote saying so publicly? Even anonymously? I have not found a source familiar with the situation who is even willing to have their views characterized and cited as from a “Government employee from an undisclosed level of government or a banker at a major financial institution”\n\nThe experts I have quoted in this article are unfamiliar with the New York City-FEMA situation and do not have familiarity with the “state of play” at Nacha or BFS. Their quotes are based on their own informed view relying on public sources, my reporting as I have communicated it to them alongside the legal research and resulting legal memo that I commissioned from attorney Ashley Burke. That memo is now itself a public document as of the publication of this article.\n\nI have never encountered the kind of alarm and panic regarding personal safety that I have in reporting this story. My February 3rd articles in Rolling Stone and in this newsletter invoked a great deal of alarm but because of the policy implications rather than people’s personal safety. Former and current Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees were willing to give many anonymous quotes that I published that week. The circle of people who truly understand these issues is smaller, more prominent, more risk-averse and have far greater informed alarm.\n\nPayments law is a kind of “source code” for all other parts of law. As we’ve seen in the tidal wave of litigation over the first 51 days of the second Trump administration, the Trump administration’s actions have violated a multitude of laws and generated a gigantic constitutional crisis over the seizure of Congress’s power of the purse by the presidency. Yet, this crisis remains unresolved because court injunctions move far slower than a fast moving and imperial presidency. Courts can’t “unspill” spilled milk. Injunctive relief is okay at stopping things, it’s far, far worse at stopping things before they happen. Using the Treasury’s intragovernmental payments system to do impoundment creates an extremely dangerous crisis and opens up the possibility of using the payments system to subordinate the Judiciary. \n\nThe possibilities I’ve laid out in this article are somehow even more dangerous than using the payments system to impound congressionally appropriated spending. As I was finalizing this article yesterday afternoon, the news broke that Citibank- in a separate case- had made a court filing providing evidence that the FBI had demanded that it freeze bank accounts associated with an Environmental Protection Administration grant program. These bank accounts included a New York state government bank account.\n\nThe pattern across my previous reporting, my current reporting, the reporting of others and this late-breaking FBI-EPA-Citibank situation suggest that the Trump administration is testing the waters in order to gain far greater control of the United States entire payments infrastructure- control great enough to bend Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s enemies to their will at a speed far faster than courts could ever conceivably contain.

Today I am again publishing a <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-musk-doge-treasury-take-money-bank-account-1235295232/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Rolling Stone article</u></a>, alongside this more technical Notes on the Crises article, to finally reveal <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/03/NOTC-Legal-Memo-No.1.pdf\"><u>the results</u></a> of two and a half weeks of exhaustive reporting on a different aspect of the ongoing Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis. Indeed, as a result of my reporting today, we can now simply call it the “Trump-Musk Payments Crisis.”</p><p>On February 11, 2025, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), an agency housed in the Department of Homeland Security, removed $80.5 million from <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/03/NOTC-Legal-Memo-No.1.pdf\"><u>New York City’s main bank account, which is an account with Citibank</u></a>. Well, that’s not exactly accurate. They “debited”, the financial way of referring to “subtracting”, New York City’s “central treasury account” for 80.5 million dollars. According to <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/chris-hayes-bursts-out-laughing-when-he-learns-trump-caused-nyc-bank-account-to-overdraft-by-79-5-million/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>public statements by Brad Lander</u></a>, New York City’s comptroller, this could only be covered by a line of credit facility to the tune of 79.5 million dollars. In short they, in essence, sent New York City’s main bank account to <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/03/NOTC-Legal-Memo-No.1.pdf\"><u>negative 79.5 million dollars</u></a>. Citibank kindly agreed to forgive the overdraft fee.&nbsp;</p><p>On February 18th a FEMA branded letter authored by Cameron Hamilton, a person described in the letter as a “Senior Official Performing the Duties of the [FEMA] Administrator”, <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.637338/gov.uscourts.nysd.637338.9.20_1.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>was sent to the New York City Office of Management and Budget</u></a>. The letter explained that the money was “clawed back” because of a range of claims about illegal activity which the New York Post alleged took place in the hotels the city paid to put Venezuelan refugees in. I can’t really communicate to readers what this letter reads like, so I will simply quote an important paragraph to provide the “flavor”:</p><blockquote>The Department of Homeland Security has significant concerns that SSP funding is going to entities engaged in or facilitating illegal activities. For example, a substantial portion of your award goes to funding alien housing at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City. According to media reports, the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren De Aragua has taken over the hotel and is using it as a recruiting center and base of operations to plan a variety of crimes. According to these same reports, these crimes include gun and drug sales as well as sex trafficking, which can reasonably be presumed to be conducted in the hotel itself. One of the groups responsible for these activities refer to themselves as “diablos de la 42,” which means the devils of 42nd St., a street near where the Roosevelt Hotel is located. DHS/FEMA has a responsibility to ensure that it does not make payments that fund criminal activity.</blockquote><p>This justification for denying congressionally appropriated funds <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/03/notc-legal-memo-no-1\"><u>is extremely legally dubious</u></a>. This justification for “reversing” the disbursement of already disbursed funds is <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/03/NOTC-Legal-Memo-No.1.pdf\"><u>far beyond legally dubious</u></a>. It brings up profound and basic issues about the functioning of our society which I will unpack throughout the rest of this article.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcztRA993xxm8830WkPqiPBCk3X364czAcc507lL1-x1NOcEVHcTKatJEl0vleGdZe-89wfkJoQxoswUMq0YTdiV933QHBYA5K8TtM02VbhZ-PZeXvGNAYHSG64TbQzWYCRL6e74A?key=ksfalpMuNUjhTU2EqdW1h56M\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"590\" height=\"458\"></figure><p>In a number of ways, the most important element of this story is that it was clearly instigated by Elon Musk. At 5 am the day before the FEMA payments were “clawed back” by FEMA, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1888891512303263815?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Elon Musk tweeted</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The<a href=\"https://x.com/DOGE?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> @DOGE</a> team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the President’s executive order.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>That money is meant for American disaster relief and instead is being spent on high end hotels for illegals!&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>A clawback demand will be made today to recoup those funds.</blockquote><p>It does not take much of a leap in logic to draw a direct line between <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/03/NOTC-Legal-Memo-No.1.pdf\"><u>this “clawback”</u></a> to Elon Musk. I must, however, leave this more political element to future reporting and stick to unraveling <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/03/NOTC-Legal-Memo-No.1.pdf\"><u>labyrinthine technical details</u></a>.</p><p>One month ago, on February 12th, I emailed the New York City Comptroller’s office. I was very busy and I thought, since New York City Comptroller Brad Lander followed me on twitter, it was likely I would get contacted in response to my email (and associated phone call). For whatever reason, my email fell through the cracks as they were flooded by media requests after their press releases on this matter. I was busy, so I forgot about it. I, however, knew as soon as I saw the story that it was extremely important. On February 24th, I <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/how-can-we-know-if-government-payments-stop-an-exploratory-analysis-of-banking-system-warning-signs/\"><u>published an article written with</u></a> the benefit of high level financial sources regarding technical banking system signs to look for impoundment- Presidential refusal to spend money congress has ordered spent- happening at scale. With that article published, I turned back to this topic and began investigating.&nbsp;</p><p>I devoted so much time to this story because of the full implications it immediately brings to mind to <a href=\"https://memos.crisesnotes.com/notclegal1?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><u>any payments system expert</u></a>. This is not simply about FEMA’s actions towards the city of New York’s bank accounts or even about large scale <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/mini-roundup-nuanced-correction-of-krugman-interview-two-columbia-law-professors-in-the-u-of-chicago-law-review-on-my-foia-project-attending-bloomberg-invest/\"><u>payments system level impoundment</u></a>. This story is about the truly electrifying and terrifying question: can the Trump administration arbitrarily take money from anyone for any reason using control of the payments system? If it can’t, what exactly are the current limits to what the Trump administration can do and <a href=\"https://memos.crisesnotes.com/notclegal1?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><u>how easy is it to break those limits?</u></a></p><p>To understand why this case brings up such <a href=\"https://memos.crisesnotes.com/notclegal1?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><u>dramatic and mind-boggling questions</u></a> readers must understand some things about the payments system they use every day without thinking about it. If you have ever gotten a direct deposit of pay, or really anything else, you have used a system called the Automatic Clearing House system or “ACH”. Social security payments are ACH payments, as are payments to medical providers. For older readers, if you look at your checkbook you will see an “ACH number” on your checks. Really, it would be easier to list what <strong>aren’t</strong> ACH payments than what are.&nbsp;</p><p>When you make a credit card payment, technically speaking what you are doing is authorizing the credit card company to send an ACH “debit” to your bank account. This debit subtracts the money and when the payment clears, the credit card company “credits” your credit card account and lowers your credit card balance (which is a type of debt). In other words, what is subtracted from your credit card debt is what they subtracted from your bank account. Your assets and liabilities go down by the same amount (except for interest payments and fees of course).</p><p>The first Automated Clearing House in the United States was organized by the “Special Committee on Paperless Entries” (SCOPE), which was an association of California bankers, <a href=\"https://files.crisesnotes.com/NT51037.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>over the course of 1968 to 1972</u></a>. The 30,000 pages of Federal Reserve Board Minutes <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/here-are-the-30-000-pages-of-federal-reserve-board-meeting-minutes-i-got-through-foia/\"><u>I got through FOIA</u></a> last year has some interesting previously unreleased material on the early formation of the first ACH network, whose day to day operation was technically run by <a href=\"https://files.crisesnotes.com/NT51037.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco</u></a>. SCOPE <a href=\"https://files.crisesnotes.com/NT51037.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>was renamed “California Automated Clearing House Association”</u></a> (CACHA) and similar regional banker associations popped up across the country to form regional automated clearing houses. This led to<a href=\"https://www.nacha.org/content/history-nacha-and-ach-network?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> the 1974 formation of the “National Automated Clearing House Association” </u></a>(NACHA, now “Nacha”) which determines the rules for Automated Clearing Houses. The actual payments infrastructure is run by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks along with <a href=\"https://www.theclearinghouse.org/About/History?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“The Clearing House</u></a>”, a clearinghouse originally set up by large New York banks all the way back in 1853.&nbsp;</p><p>That is all a long and exhaustive way of saying that the Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment system is one of the foundational building blocks of all payments made in our society. Nearly every payment you make is either an ACH payment or it relies indirectly on accurate and timely ACH payments. Furthermore, any institution you rely on directly or indirectly relies on accurate and timely ACH payments to function properly. If the reliability of Automatic Clearing House payments were to be permanently or <a href=\"https://memos.crisesnotes.com/notclegal1?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><u>indefinitely degraded in a crucial manner</u></a>, it would fundamentally threaten your access to basic social services, and even privately produced and distributed goods and services. To explain why, we have to understand a fundamental, yet neglected, area of law called “payment finality”.</p><p>The idea of “payment finality” is deceptively basic. What it refers to is the point at which a transaction is concluded by full and satisfactory payment. Contracts, for example, are a relationship between two parties. Those parties have a contract relationship for as long as the contract is outstanding. If I hire you to build me a cabinet, we are in a contractual relationship until you deliver a finished cabinet and I deliver your payment in full. If we meet at a street intersection and you deliver me the cabinet, once you receive final payment the transaction is complete.But what is the “final payment”? </p><p>For many centuries physical money was a dominant mode of “arm's length” payment so final payment was when physical money was handed over and safely in the possession of the recipient or “payee”. In fact, as York University law professor Benjamin Geva points out in his 2011 book <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/payment-order-of-antiquity-and-the-middle-ages-9781849460521/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“The Payment Order of Antiquity and the Middle Ages: A Legal History”</u></a>, this is a common <em>definition</em> of money in legal history. The landmark English case <em>Moss v Hancock</em> defines money, in part, as “that which passes freely from hand to hand throughout the community in final discharge of debts”. In a very real sense then, money is that object, or system, that you can make final payment with.</p><p>Consequently what defined physical objects as “currency” was that they could be universally proffered as final payment. Being a “legal tender” meant that you could provide them in final payment for an obligation. You could “legally tender” those objects. The idea of final payment is easier with “bearer instruments” like cash. A “bearer instrument” is just a type of financial instrument that is owned outright by whoever possesses it. A dollar bill is the only “bearer instrument” the vast majority of ordinary people interact with. The concept of final payment feels intuitive and straightforward with physical items that you hand over, which then become property of the recipient once you hand it over. We no longer live in the world of cash. We live in the world of accounts.</p><p>In the world of accounts, a disturbing question hangs over us: when is a payment truly final? Or as famous New York philosophers Yogi Berra and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmENMZFUU_0&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Lenny Kravitz might say</u></a> \"It ain't over till it's over\". If, in theory, my account can always be subtracted from- if my account can always be “debited”- is a transaction ever really final? When there is an “operational” possibility the government, or any key actor in the payments system, can simply debit accounts payment, “finality” always has a hanging thread of doubt. Under <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/special-notice-my-colleague-rohan-grey-has-finished-the-defining-law-review-article-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis/\"><u>our current technological and administrative arrangements</u></a>, the only protection against this possibility is a layer of laws and norms which constrain — even asphyxiate — this distressing prospect.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In other words, we socially and legally construct payment finality as “truth”. Yet the fabric of these social and legal constructions are far more fragile than most people imagine. Proposals, such as my colleague Rohan Grey’s proposal for a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/special-notice-my-colleague-rohan-grey-has-finished-the-defining-law-review-article-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis/\"><u>congressionally-issued digital fiat currency</u></a>, are important because they aim to undergird payment finality with new technological and administrative arrangements that will provide much stronger protections against this kind of abuse, along with impoundment itself. But we can’t wait for what does not yet exist. We have to deal with what is happening now.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/04/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"809\" height=\"475\" srcset=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/image-1.png 600w, https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/04/image-1.png 809w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Which brings me back to ACH. Given the complexity, and relative obscurity, of this area of law and the immense amount of reporting and research I already had to do for this story, I decided to commission <a href=\"https://memos.crisesnotes.com/notclegal1?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><u>a full length legal memo</u></a>- similar to the legal memos a staff attorney at a financial regulatory agency or white shoe law firm might produce- on the “Federal Government Use of the Automated Clearing House System”. The attorney I commissioned, Ashley Burke, did an excellent job and I have uploaded <a href=\"https://memos.crisesnotes.com/notclegal1?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong><u>“Notes on the Crises Legal Memorandum No. 1”</u></strong></a><strong> </strong>to my website to make it widely available and free to anyone who is in need of <a href=\"https://memos.crisesnotes.com/notclegal1?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><u>detailed legal analysis</u></a> in this suddenly crucial area of law. Ashley is, of course, not responsible for any of the claims I make in this article and can’t attest to the accuracy or reliability of my reporting. Nor can her memo be construed as legal advice.&nbsp;</p><p>Recognizing the importance of payment finality, the National Automated Clearing House Association has promulgated rules in this area. Meanwhile, the laws congress has passed about ACH payments are broad and vague. However, as Ashley lays out <a href=\"https://memos.crisesnotes.com/notclegal1?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><u>in her legal memo</u></a>, Nacha rules can and are currently superseded in a variety of ways by what is called “agency rulemaking”. Generally speaking, when congress passes laws that are subject to varying interpretations- and when is law not subject to varying interpretations?- administrative agencies engage in the “rulemaking” process to “interpret” the law for practical use by government, businesses, civil society and the world at large.&nbsp;</p><p>This “agency discretion” over interpreting the law is <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-should-we-care-if-the-trump-administration-and-musks-doge-are-acting-unconstitutionally/\"><u>the core of the “administrative state” that right wing think tanks say they are aiming to destroy</u></a>. Yet in this situation, they may begin to use discretion in interpreting payments law to fundamentally undermine the reliability of payment finality and capriciously “take back” or even “take” from groups and people they disfavor. Thus, there is nothing in payments law that provides a clear or unambiguous check on the Trump administration’s actions if they decide to reinterpret payment statutes in order to weaponize the Federal Government’s legal authority over the ACH system.</p><p>It is hard to explain how explosive degrading- let alone destroying- the legal reliability of payment finality is. <a href=\"https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/mark-d-flood?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Mark Flood, a research scholar</u></a> at the Center for Financial Policy at University of Maryland with two decades of financial regulatory &amp; policy experience in Federal Government <a href=\"https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/directory/mark-d-flood?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>tells me</u></a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Uncertainty about payment finality has the potential to degrade insidiously the performance of the financial system. If there is generally a nonzero chance that even settled payments might be reversed, then the most liquid of assets (cash balances) could lose reliability and therefore value: $1 of 'cash in the bank' may no longer be regarded as worth $1.</blockquote><p>Along similar lines, A former Federal Reserve Lawyer tells me:</p><blockquote>Our monetary system depends on a strong concept of payment finality. Exceptions must be reserved for only truly extraordinary cases. From what I understand of the facts of this case this is not an extraordinary situation. Reversing of final payments, in a stable financial system, should never be in the ordinary course of business”</blockquote><p>These quotes may read as subtle to many lay readers. I can tell you that to payment experts- hell, as a payments expert- these quotes make our eyes widen with alarm. Part of what I have been trying to accomplish with my reporting these past six weeks is to serve as a translator for the panic many experts truly feel, but do not feel at liberty to express openly.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>So if the bank-based payment system or payments law is not a constraint, are there others? At first glance, it might seem like there are. Administrative agencies can’t just decide to debit accounts. They have to get payment reversals or separate debit transactions certified at a central point. Readers of <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-seven-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-yours-and-wireds-reporting-is-actually-doing-something/\"><u>Notes on the Crises</u></a> or <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-elon-musk-treasury-payment-system-dangerous-1235254831/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>my previous Rolling Stone article</u></a> are already dreading what they correctly suspect is coming next. The body that certifies debit transactions is… the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. With DOGE’s <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>Thomas Krause as Fiscal Assistant Secretary</u></a>, it is unlikely, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-asked-former-bureau-of-the-fiscal-service-employees-to-interpret-an-elon-musk-tweet/\"><u>to say the least</u></a>, that the Bureau of the Fiscal Service will be blocking such requests from agencies (If you are a current or former Bureau of the Fiscal service employee familiar with the situation, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/notes-on-the-crises-investigative-journalism-source-wish-list/\"><u>please get into contact</u></a>). A current Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee when told about the circumstances in this case replied \"who makes the decision [at BFS] to reverse [ACH payments] probably just bows to the king [Trump]”.&nbsp;</p><p>A former BFS employee tells me:</p><blockquote>The circumstances you describe from the FEMA-New York situation sound highly unusual. Payment finality except in extraordinary and clearly-defined circumstances are critical to a functioning and credible payment system.&nbsp; Once a payment is finalized, agencies would normally need to use legal remedies outside the disbursement process to seek recovery of improper payments.</blockquote><p>That last sentence is a key point. The objection here is not to using any legal mechanism to retrieve an “improper” payment. Of course it is, to say the least, very open to question that the Trump administration accurately identifies improper payments rather than disfavored payments. The objection informed observers have is to improperly using the payments system to recover payments which were settled because they contradict the current administration’s policies. The Trump administration’s, and <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-asked-former-bureau-of-the-fiscal-service-employees-to-interpret-an-elon-musk-tweet/\"><u>Elon Musk’s, repeated misrepresentation and expanded definitions of “improper payments”</u></a> fundamentally obscure this crucial distinction.</p><p>Public reporting already suggests that the New York City government is generally resistant to pursuing this issue in the manner required by its eye-popping seriousness. Over the course of reporting this article I have, on multiple occasions, encountered circumstances, circumstances that I’m not at liberty to discuss in more specific terms for reasons of journalistic ethics, which have reinforced that impression. Reasons for this could include fear of a larger confrontation with the Trump administration or specific fear that the Trump administration would revive Biden-era federal corruption charges against Mayor Adams that Trump’s Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5297120/eric-adams-federal-prosecutors-resignations?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>caused a firestorm by dropping</u></a>, but with the possibility of refiling. Legal expert and former solicitor general under George W. Bush Paul Clement <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/eric-adams-mayor-corruption-investigations-new-york-ff69304f74787e5ecdd458b8ca242b47?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>has advised federal district judge Dale E. Ho in Adams’ case</u></a> that he should permanently dismiss the charges so they do not hang over Mayor Adams like “the proverbial Sword of Damocles”.</p><p>It is thus very important to these circumstances that the New York City Comptroller Brad Lander is an independently elected official who can advocate for the city’s interests, as well as the American people’s interests more generally, separately from Mayor Eric Adams. Brad Lander has put out public statements in the last month openly stating that his advocacy has compelled “reversals” of New York City government’s decisions in this matter.&nbsp; On February 14th, for example, the comptroller office published an official Brad Lander statement <a href=\"https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/statement-pressure-from-nyc-comptroller-lander-leads-to-adams-administrations-reversal-on-recouping-fema-funding/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>saying</u></a>:</p><blockquote>I was relieved to receive a reply from Corporation Counsel Muriel Goode-Trufant this afternoon, agreeing to commence legal action, no later than one week from today. I am grateful that our urgent insistence pushed the Law Department to pursue litigation, even at this precarious moment. I look forward to doing everything in my power to help the City recoup the FEMA funds stolen by President Trump and holding accountable those intent on working against the best interests of New Yorkers.</blockquote><p>It is important in this context to explain that the NYC comptroller office deals with accounting. Managerial accounting is only interested in payments insofar as payment reconciliation is important for accurate accounting with adequate internal controls.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>In response to a request for comment Chloe Chik, spokesperson for the New York City Comptroller, says:</p><blockquote>While we cannot comment on the specifics due to ongoing litigation, as the City's Chief Financial Officer, the Comptroller's office has accounting oversight of the city's ledgers, including City bank account activities. Because of our role in monitoring the City's cash balances, the Comptroller's office was able to uncover the overdraft associated with the $80.5m clawback</blockquote><p>This is important because the lawsuit in this area is a New York City lawsuit which the Comptroller’s office and its legal counsel are involved in, but do not have the final say over. The phrase “accounting oversight” is key because it means that the details of what went on, and goes on, on the ACH payments side is not in their purview. That is the New York City Finance department, which as of this writing could not be reached for comment. The intragovernmental conflict over this case in New York City concerns me because I worry that the most foundational legal issues may not be resolved, or even seriously litigated, in New York City’s lawsuit over this matter.</p><p>One of the reasons this story has been so difficult to report and has taken as long as it has is that it has been extremely difficult to find sources willing to be quoted, or really even vaguely characterized. To understand why, think of this topic from the point of view of a financial or payment expert (whether among lawyers or in other fields). Imagine you were such a person and you believed that the Trump administration was in the process of successfully claiming for itself the power to arbitrarily reverse any government payment or even, in the worst case scenarios, arbitrarily confiscate the funds in any person’s bank account without due process of law. Would you be willing to risk being targeted for giving a quote saying so publicly? Even anonymously? I have not found a source familiar with the situation who is even willing to have their views characterized and cited as from a “Government employee from an undisclosed level of government or a banker at a major financial institution”</p><p>The experts I have quoted in this article are unfamiliar with the New York City-FEMA situation and do not have familiarity with the “state of play” at Nacha or BFS. Their quotes are based on their own informed view relying on public sources, my reporting as I have communicated it to them alongside the legal research and <a href=\"https://memos.crisesnotes.com/notclegal1?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><u>resulting legal memo</u></a> that I commissioned from attorney Ashley Burke. That <a href=\"https://memos.crisesnotes.com/notclegal1?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><u>memo is now itself a public document</u></a> as of the publication of this article. </p><p>I have never encountered the kind of alarm and panic regarding personal safety that I have in reporting this story. My February 3rd articles in <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-elon-musk-treasury-payment-system-dangerous-1235254831?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Rolling Stone</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>in this newsletter</u></a> invoked a great deal of alarm but because of the policy implications rather than people’s personal safety. Former and current Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees were willing to give many anonymous quotes that I published that week. The circle of people who truly understand these issues is smaller, more prominent, more risk-averse and have far greater informed alarm.</p><p>Payments law is a kind of “source code” for all other parts of law. As we’ve seen in the tidal wave of litigation over the first 51 days of the second Trump administration, the Trump administration’s actions have <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>violated a multitude of laws</u></a> and generated a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-should-we-care-if-the-trump-administration-and-musks-doge-are-acting-unconstitutionally/\"><u>gigantic constitutional crisis</u></a> over the seizure of Congress’s power of the purse by the presidency. Yet, this crisis remains unresolved because court injunctions move far slower than a<a href=\"https://abovethelaw.com/2025/02/nyc-sues-fema-for-80m-smash-and-grab-stunt/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> fast moving and imperial presidency</u></a>. Courts can’t “unspill” spilled milk. Injunctive relief is okay at stopping things, it’s far, far worse at stopping things before they happen. Using the Treasury’s intragovernmental payments system to do impoundment creates an extremely dangerous crisis and opens up the possibility of using the payments system to <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/musk-in-your-computers-paul-krugman-interviews-nathan-tankus/\"><u>subordinate the Judiciary</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The possibilities I’ve laid out in this article are somehow even more dangerous than using the payments system to impound congressionally appropriated spending. As I was finalizing this article yesterday afternoon, the news broke that Citibank- in a separate case- had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25559515-citibankpaus/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>made a court filing</u></a> providing evidence that the <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25559514/fbiletters.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>FBI had demanded that it freeze</u></a> bank accounts associated with an Environmental Protection Administration grant program. These bank accounts included a New York state government bank account. </p><p>The pattern across my previous reporting, my current reporting, the reporting of others and this late-breaking FBI-EPA-Citibank situation suggest that the Trump administration is testing the waters in order to gain far greater control of the United States entire payments infrastructure- control great enough to bend Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s enemies to their will at a speed far faster than courts could ever conceivably contain. We are entering waters beyond the scale of constitutional crises and nearly every expert in this shallow pool feels ill-equipped to speak about it publicly for a variety of reasons. I’m having trouble imagining circumstances more dangerous.</p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/can-the-trump-administration-arbitrarily-take-money-from-anyones-bank-account/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"93a0ad7a-e93f-4cf4-aca5-9d75a1015477","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"67d26ae3e7f89500014b5bb1","reading_time":17}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"March 11","id":"Ghost__Post__67cfef1282821f0001c5b3cb","title":"Special Notice: My Colleague Rohan Grey Has Finished the Defining Law Review Article of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis","slug":"special-notice-my-colleague-rohan-grey-has-finished-the-defining-law-review-article-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/03/Special-Note-Grey-Digitizing-the-Fisc.png","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b80808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/4c4f624186c3c39788a99940261a53bb/900df/Special-Note-Grey-Digitizing-the-Fisc.png","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/4c4f624186c3c39788a99940261a53bb/b2ba1/Special-Note-Grey-Digitizing-the-Fisc.png 397w,\n/migrantinsider/static/4c4f624186c3c39788a99940261a53bb/60c94/Special-Note-Grey-Digitizing-the-Fisc.png 795w,\n/migrantinsider/static/4c4f624186c3c39788a99940261a53bb/900df/Special-Note-Grey-Digitizing-the-Fisc.png 1589w","sizes":"(min-width: 1589px) 1589px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/4c4f624186c3c39788a99940261a53bb/6a135/Special-Note-Grey-Digitizing-the-Fisc.webp 397w,\n/migrantinsider/static/4c4f624186c3c39788a99940261a53bb/4f397/Special-Note-Grey-Digitizing-the-Fisc.webp 795w,\n/migrantinsider/static/4c4f624186c3c39788a99940261a53bb/f2d72/Special-Note-Grey-Digitizing-the-Fisc.webp 1589w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1589px) 1589px, 100vw"}]},"width":1589,"height":830}}},"excerpt":"At the end of my Paul Krugman interview, I made a point to plug Modern Money Network president and Willamette University law professor Rohan Grey’s then-unfinished article on payments bottlenecks at the Federal Reserve and Treasury.

Here's my address: bc1qegxarzsfga9ycesfa7wm77sqmuqqv7083c6ss6\n\nHello readers, this is not a full piece today. Well, I’m a writer so what I mean by “full piece” is it has a coherent and cohesive narrative that I unpack from introduction to conclusion. This “update” will still have plenty of content. First, I’m attending Bloomberg Invest today! Come say hello if you’d like, especially if you’re interested in figuring out how you can help fund the expansion of my work.\n\nNext up, I wanted to flag a nuanced but significant error I made in my interview with Paul Krugman (recorded last Wednesday and released on Saturday). I had spent most of the morning before our interview working on my piece on the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. As a result, I did not have time to reread my coverage. This led me to inadvertently make a claim I don’t yet have sufficient evidence for:  \n\nTankus: [...] One explosive court filing is that already by the time that I had come to find out about this on January 31st, they had been at the payments level of blocking payments, which, what I mean is there's literally these payment files written basically the same way they would be written in the 1970s that get processed through these systems and get sent on to the Federal Reserve to be processed by ACH, Automated Clearing House, which is how any sort of small or medium-sized value payment works. You get a payment from Social Security and it's a direct deposit to your account, it is an ACH payment. That's the system.\n\nAnd they were literally just taking the files and going, ‘we're not handing those over. We're not processing this because we're shutting down USAID.’ And as we know, they've now taken over the building and shut down USAID, but they were also doing that at the payments level. And so with the Hamilton Projects tracker, you can see the payments from USAID go to zero, literally zero January 28th. So they were literally doing this.\n\nKrugman: So that's before they actually seized the building and told everybody to go home. They actually just stopped the payments. Wow. So I was going to offer a hypothetical, but I don't need to. That's an actual case. They just sort of made the judgment, decided we don't like USAID and without even telling the officials at USAID to stop paying the money or before we get around to that, we just tell the computer to stop making the payments.\n\nTankus: Exactly. And there is an even further incident that the court filings reveal that I reported on last week [...]\n\nIn responding to Krugman’s prompt, I collapsed two different points together. The Hamilton Project’s tracker shows the USAID payments fell to zero on January 28th. Separately, court filings have sworn testimony of payment files being stopped and flagged for review on January 31st. I do not currently have sources that confirm for me that the USAID payments stopping on January 28th was because of payments level impoundment. Indeed, that was the day the OMB memo came out which many agencies reacted to. \n\nHowever, other payments for other agencies got started again in the days following the OMB memo while USAID’s did not. Thus, I can’t confirm when payment levels impoundment began. The building takeover happened the night of January 31st, while the court filings have USAID payment files being flagged January 31st. So the “official” timeline of events still has payment-level impoundment preceding the building being taken over, just by a matter of hours and not days. If you know the timing of these events in greater detail, please contact me using the Signal information provided above.\n\nNevertheless, I regret the error and hope my eagerness to point out my mistakes sustains the credibility I’ve built up, especially over the past five weeks. Please check out the rest of the Paul Krugman interview which I stand by completely.\n\nSubscribe\n\nWhich brings me to my favorite part of this round up, FOIAing the Federal Reserve. That project has taken a backseat to what’s going on now, but it still holds a special role for me.\n\n\n\nOne reason why I was financially struggling throughout 2024 is that I had devoted myself to an enormous Archival and Federal Reserve project without a budget. I knew it was extraordinarily important and felt utterly compelled to see it through, regardless of the personal financial pressure it involved. Getting other people to understand that it was important, let alone willing to compensate me for the enormous labor I put into it, was extremely difficult. A large part of the reason why I pursued building institutional subscriptions was that I knew a much narrower audience of decision-makers were the ones who knew the importance of what I was doing. Institutional subscriptions are however, a slow involved effort that are still ongoing. In other words, I launched one big investment project with no budget and tried to solve it by launching another budgetless big investment project. I would like to again mention the important volunteer labor John Jay Student Josie-Grace Valerius did to make my free, searchable 30,000 page Federal Reserve Board Minutes Archive possible.\n\nFor the reasons stated above I’m very grateful to my friends Kate Judge and Lev Menand who are Columbia Law Professors who focus on money and finance. Yesterday a Law Review Essay they wrote for the University of Chicago Law Review was published which is entitled “Regionalism and the Federal Reserve Banks”. Putting their argument aside, what is extremely noticeable about this essay is how heavily it relies on three monographs written by Mid-Century Federal Reserve general counsel Howard Hackley. \n\nHackley 1969. Should the Stock of the Federal Reserve Banks Be Retired?\n\nHackley 1970. Should Requirements with Respect to the Selection of Reserve Bank Directors Be Changed?\n\nHackley 1972. The Status of the Federal Reserve System in the Federal Government\n\nThese are monographs I released thirteen months ago along with four other texts in a piece entitled: “Revealed: The Seven Secret Federal Reserve Books I Won Through FOIA”. It is thus no exaggeration to say that a critical evidentiary foundation of this essay in the University of Chicago Law Review is my “Law of the Federal Reserve FOIA project”. I also provided extensive feedback on the paper last summer. It was thus very gratifying to see this quote in yesterday’s published version which was not in the version that I had reviewed:\n\nAlso relevant here is that it was only because of a FOIA request that many of the internal memoranda authored by Hackley, which were so influential internally [at the Federal Reserve], have finally become public [Footnote:] Nathan Tankus, Revealed: The Seven Secret Federal Reserve Books I Won Through FOIA, NOTES ON THE CRISIS (Feb. 6, 2024), https://perma.cc/32XA-C6LB.\n\nSo thank you very much to Kate and Lev. I hope to have them write a guest piece in the newsletter over the summer elaborating on this point. I’m grateful to my readers for the past six weeks who facilitated that “sweat equity” paying off. As I will discuss in greater length in the future, your support has made it possible for me to think about expanding Notes on the Crises in exciting ways. Because I’m attending Bloomberg Invest, another piece may not be until Thursday afternoon.","html":"<p><strong>The extensive “Notes on the Crises Investigative Journalism Source Wish List” </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/notes-on-the-crises-investigative-journalism-source-wish-list/\"><strong><u>can be found here</u></strong></a><strong>.

But it never occurred to me that Musk’s people would try to seize control of the computer systems that, in effect, cut all the checks the federal government sends out. In fact, very few people realized it was happening.\n\nOne person who did realize it, however, was Nathan Tankus — an independent expert on the financial “plumbing” at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. So Nathan suddenly became the man of the moment. His blog Notes on the Crises has become crucial reading — and he may have helped steer us, temporarily at least, away from the edge of the abyss.\n\nSo I interviewed him a few days ago. Below you’ll find a slightly edited version of the video and a very slightly cleaned-up version of the transcript. It seems to me that getting the information out is more important than having slick production values.\n\nAlso, no paywall on this one; it was a lot of work, but it’s too important to shut off anyone’s access.\n\nAnd here we go:\n\nPrinter Friendly Version\n\n[Find the Youtube video embedded above and linked here (I will be having my website redesigned so that, among other things, embedded youtube videos look nicer)]\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nKrugman: Hi, I'm Paul Krugman. This is the latest in my series of videos. I thought it would be really interesting to talk to Nathan Tankus, who has ended up playing a really remarkable role in helping to at least make us aware of and possibly take some precautions against what looks like a kind of digital takeover by Elon Musk's people. And we'll get into all of that. But I first want to ask, Nathan, if you could talk a little bit about your background and how you came to be in this position. As I understand it, you're kind of a financial plumbing expert, if we could say that. Would that be a fair description?\n\nTankus: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nKrugman: Were you at the Fed or at the Treasury?\n\nTankus: No, I'm a pure outsider.\n\nKrugman: An outsider but you've paid a lot of attention to what they do. We think that management says ‘send money there’ and it just happens but it's actually a very elaborate process, right?\n\nTankus: Absolutely. You asked about my background, how I came to this. So I feel like that's an opportunity to go way back in my history. And for me, this all started in January 2009. I'm 33 so in January 2009 I was still in high school and I went to a kind of small alternative public high school called Urban Academy and I had two teachers who just taught a class called Show Me the Money where we read selections of the newspaper each week. We read, I don't know, probably a dozen Paul Krugman blog posts or columns and I started reading your blog every day, among a whole bunch of other blogs, and I just became obsessed. So I'm one of these people who was really kind of woken up by the Great Financial Crisis and it captured their imagination and just rolled with that. I've kind of bounced around a lot of different things since then, but in meantime, picked up a lot of knowledge where I got to the point where I was actually asking such kind of interesting detailed questions where people, even former treasury or federal reserve people, would be willing to talk to me because I was asking the kind of questions that no one else was asking. And so that 15 year journey, which involved, like, a big success during the beginning of coronavirus, has kind of brought me to this place, this unique position to be able to write about these kinds of things.\n\nKrugman: Just tell me what was the success with coronavirus?\n\nTankus: I started my newsletter Notes on the Crises on March 19th, 2020, because it was clear to me that there was going to be a lot of economic impacts. There already were at that point, but there were going to be a lot more and they weren't very well understood. And anyone who had any sort of expertise or knowledge with what the Federal Reserve was doing, what were called “crisis facilities,” where they launched these suites of programs that were going to support the financial system, support municipalities, state and local government, support the corporate sector, and that anyone who had detailed knowledge of those programs was either in government, at a think tank (and thus had to be doing all sorts of things assigned by their bosses), a journalist who was too busy covering the big picture stuff to get into the details, or was a professor who was trying to figure out how to teach on Zoom suddenly in the middle of a semester. And so I had a unique opportunity as someone who was kind of a total outsider, did not have a nine to five job that made me commit to doing some other set of activities. So I could just devote all my time to writing about it. That first four months, I wrote a piece every other day, including weekends on average. Just, you know, that first month I put out 21 pieces and that sort of big rush is what made my career. Bloomberg Business Week did a profile on me. So in a strange way, I've kind of already had this experience that I've been having for the past month, but obviously this month has been much more intense and much more dramatic.\n\nKrugman: OK, we stepped up to help people through this—what I was calling a ‘medically induced coma for the economy’ during Covid. But that involved trying to get money out in unusual, unprecedented ways and presumably was technically very demanding. And you were writing about that then.\n\nTankus: Absolutely. I was largely focused on the Federal Reserve, but I had interest in other things, including state unemployment insurance and actually how, as we'll get to in a bit, related to this, how their COBOL systems made updating them very technically complex. So for example, why the unemployment insurance checks were an additional $600 a week, rather than say, “We're going to replace 80% of your income.” It was just too technically complicated in the time available to program 80% or replacement rates. And so they just slapped on adding $600 a week to everyone's check because that was technically easier.\n\nKrugman: That's interesting. I knew that the number 600 was based on average earnings. But I didn't think about why it was a fixed number... But yeah, I do remember the state of New Jersey, which is where I was at the time, putting out a desperate appeal for people who knew how to program in COBOL. Because basically nobody knows how to do that anymore.\n\nTankus: Yeah. I desperately tried to get my dad to take up New Jersey's call, but he had just retired December 2019 and he had no interest whatsoever.\n\nKrugman: So you were looking at the Fed's efforts. I know that obviously the Fed has to have been doing extraordinary stuff to maintain liquidity, but I wasn't really paying attention to that side of it. Just a word or two, maybe too technical for a lot of people, but just what were they doing that was especially unusual and difficult?\n\nTankus: The vast majority of the programs that they launched were similar to programs that they had launched in 2008 in response to the great financial crisis. And so these were a suite of programs that were designed to do what worked in normal times: preserve liquidity to the banking system and wider financial markets. Normally you just rely on financial market participants to do that and the Fed is operating quietly in the background as a backstop, and they had to take on that explicitly. So, normally you provide liquidity to the banking system. The banking system makes sure that wider financial market participants have liquidity. They make sure that say, you know, corporate bonds are liquid and that, you know, corporations can borrow at a pretty reasonable rate or rather a rate that is in line with the Fed's broader monetary policy. But all of the sort of creaking conditions of financial markets breaking down in response to the disruptions expected by COVID meant that what the Fed usually does implicitly, it felt like it had to do explicitly. So it launched a primary corporate credit market facility and a secondary corporate credit market facility, which is really just a fancy way of saying they directly lent to corporations or they bought corporate debt off of financial market participants who had this corporate debt, or anyone who really needed to sell it. And they launched those kind of programs for state and local governments all across the board.\n\nThey just made sure that anyone who needed liquidity essentially had it and that if things were going to break down, they were going to break down by COVID's direct effects and not by not being able to borrow money.\n\nKrugman: For listeners, I know a little bit, but only a little bit about this. In normal times, certainly the way that textbooks teach it, the Fed buys treasury bills from banks. That's how the Fed gets money out into the economy, which is straightforward. But when everything is breaking down, they can't count on the money actually getting out there to where it's needed. I knew people who worked on their commercial paper facility in 2009, which was basically, roughly speaking, small business lending. Normally the Fed would just put money into the banks and expect it to find its way, but the market wasn't working. So the Fed was doing this on a much wider scale. And you were tracking how they were actually doing this, so, paying attention to the specific programs.\n\nTankus: Absolutely. I wrote this big seven part series on all the details where, literally, I went through every press release that the Federal Reserve released since the beginning of February, 2020, and just tried to provide a simple-as-possible explanation of every single press release. And that kind of comprehensive detailed painstaking work got a lot of attention.\n\nKrugman: That's really interesting. Last week I did a conversation with Jim Chanos, the famous short seller, and he would base his research, not on having spies, but on actually just taking stuff that was in the public domain, but actually reading it. It sounds like that's what you were doing.\n\nTankus: Absolutely. That is definitely the kind of approach that I've developed to understanding things. And I've kind of reached the point of reading whatever's in the public domain in detail enough that people want to talk to me. I've now reached the point where I've read so much of that stuff that the bankers and former Fed and Treasury and maybe current people want to talk to me.\n\nKrugman: Okay. Is there something else you want to tell us about the background before we move up to the current crisis?\n\nTankus: I think that is it. I think the one thing I would say is, I'm known as a Federal Reserve person because I did that big thing during coronavirus. I'm known as a Fed person. And so to some people, it's a little strange getting into what we're going to talk about, where it seems kind of the Fed's there, but it's in the background. It's a side detail in this story, which maybe will unfortunately become more important in the coming months. And so people are kind of like, well, what is this? And I kind of have a general interest in payment systems, in the monetary system, in the financial system, how Congress's budgetary process works, you know, kind of all of these things in all of their complex interrelations. And that's a lot of what my colleagues and I do at the Modern Money Network, where I'm a research director.\n\nKrugman: Okay. You were doing the Fed back then, but Treasury also has a part. Obviously, there's a lot of plumbing involved. If the Secretary of the Treasury says issue checks to a bunch of people and Treasury Secretary says ‘make it so,’ what I hadn't realized was there is basically an agency, an office, there's a particular relatively small unit in Treasury that makes that happen. What's that? A bureau. The bureau of the treasury, which is actually kind of what for normal, inaccurate language, kind of cuts the checks, right? Is that a fair description?\n\nTankus: Absolutely. That's a fair description, Paul.\n\nKrugman: And their normal role is simple. They don't verify whether something is a good policy. That's not their job. They don't verify whether the people are deserving. They just sort of verify whether this has been authorized. Is that right?\n\nTankus: Yeah, that's exactly correct. You can kind of think about it with your bank. If you write a check and say, ‘I've got to pay this bill, I've got to pay my utility bill,’ maybe they can tell from the name of the company that it's your utility company. But they don't say, ‘hey, what type of thing are you spending on? Is this for alcohol? I don't think that is good for you. We're going to have this check bounce. You're going to have to pay a whole bunch of fees because you're not supposed to be buying that.’ That's exactly what we generally don't want a payment system to do. We don't want there to be like a Payments Big Brother that tells us ‘you can have this, but you can't have that.’ The example I used in one of my articles is, conservatives don't want there to be some liberal person in the payment system limiting how much meat you can buy in a month.\n\nKrugman: If you are using a debit card, they do have fraud algorithms, departments, that will flag a transaction as looking like the kind of thing you usually don’t buy or doesn't look like your spending. So I'll get a text and say, ‘respond yes or no,’ which is, I guess, a protection. But anyway, there may be a little bit of that going on here as well but basically, ‘does it look like a properly authorized payment,’ right?\n\nTankus: Yeah, that's a great example, actually, because, you know, we'll get into more of the details in a second of the various other systems. But when this bureau, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, sends out payments, it doesn't just actually [just] send out a payment. It checks a payment. It does a final check. You know, there's supposed to be other processes that check, but they do a last check against a system which is called officially the Do Not Pay system. And there's various parts of this system which flags if, you know, ‘is the person getting this check dead,’ that kind of thing. But, if you get flagged by Do Not Pay, they don't then say, ‘Well, alright, this payment's not going out.’ All that is just a check, and then they send it back to the agency. The same way that you get that text message that says, ‘hey, did you really mean to make this payment?’ They send it back to the agency and say, ‘hey, did you really mean to make this payment?’ Or maybe there's an issue with this payment. ‘Look further into it.’ But if the agency comes back and goes, ‘Hey. No, this payment is legit. Send this payment.’ They're not going to overrule them. And so this system does it in a more complicated way but does the same thing as your bank, saying, ‘hey, did you really mean to make that debit card transaction?’\n\nKrugman: Okay. And by the way, sometimes it works, you know? There was somebody ordering basically from the equivalent of Uber Eats, but in Britain and was ordering Indian food in a suburb of London on my card. That was not me.\n\nBut, okay, how big is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service? How many people are we talking about roughly? It's quite tiny, right?\n\nTankus: I don't have the employment right off the top of my head, but I would guess, like, let's call it 2,000 - 3,000 people [Editorial note, I was close. They had nearly 2000 “Full Time Equivalent” employees in Fiscal Year 2020 & 2021 and 1826 in Fiscal Year 2024] and it handles around $5 trillion of payments.\n\nKrugman: So this is really quite a small agency, but its job is not to decide what's a good payment. Okay, so you became aware that some of Elon Musk's people were getting access to this Bureau. Tell me what was... it was actually just news stories, right? So, what did Nathan Tankus know and how did he know it?\n\nTankus: Friday, January 31st, I had just put out a big piece about how we already were in a constitutional crisis. I described a five alarm fire constitutional crisis. There had just been this implementation memo from the Office of Management and Budget directing a sweeping freezing of spending across the federal government until the Trump administration could review it. This caused immediate chaos. The Medicaid portals to send payments out through Medicaid went down. This had caused such an immediate disruption that they had to rescind the memo, but they hadn't rescinded the executive orders that were driving this memo. And so I wrote a long piece about why this is a big deal. Why, what's called impoundment, which is not spending what Congress directs or appropriates to be spent, is a big deal, why it's a constitutional crisis, why it is like a fundamental demotion of Congress's role in our constitutional system. So I was already focused on this issue and I was already pretty concerned.\n\nYou know, my newsletter is called Notes on the Crises. So, I'm paying attention to crisis. Crisis is, you know, when people are really reading my articles and when you're really getting a lot of them, that's when you know something's really, really wrong, you know? So I was already focused on this. And in an article in the Washington Post I had seen a headline about how a high level person in the Treasury had resigned in protest or is on leave or something, but related to the treasury's payment system. And as a payments expert, that headline was incredibly alarming. So alarming, in fact, that I put it aside and I couldn't get myself to read it for a few hours. I had gotten caught up with promoting my piece that day, so I hadn't eaten that day. So I was like, ‘I'm gonna go get something to eat.’\n\nAnd my friend, colleague, the economist Stephanie Kelton at Stony Brook, when I told her that, she had already read the article and was already alarmed. She said, ‘I don't think that's the right order.’ But nevertheless, I hadn't eaten that day. So I went to go eat, and then I went to go read it. I mean, literally, four paragraphs into this article, I had a panic attack. It was possibly the scariest or one of the scariest moments of my life when I read that article. And it was so scary to me because what the article said was that the Fiscal Assistant Secretary, who's the highest civil servant in the treasury, where everyone above him are political appointees. You know, there's that top layer of every agency which are political appointees that, you might fire the old people, you fire the Biden administration or the Trump people, and you bring in your people. That’s a normal expected part of government. But everyone below them are supposed to be professional civil servants who were doing the job regardless of the partisan status of the executive branch, regardless of who is president. And the fact that this person had been pushed out because DOGE and Elon Musk in the Department of Government Efficiency were asking to have access to the Treasury and this guy, a long time official, someone who'd been in the government since 1989, had been in this highest status position since 10 years ago had been widely credited as the person who has expertly managed the treasury and payments throughout the various debt ceiling crises where you're trying to squeeze every dollar and make sure payments go out without breaching the debt ceiling. I immediately understood how desperately serious and what the worst case scenarios could be and was overwhelmed by it. And I was also overwhelmed and alarmed as an expert in this area that so few people understood how serious this was that it was, and that it was going to be, that it's not just that this was so dangerous, but that there was very few people who were in a position to really say anything about this. And to be frank, my newsletter is called Notes on the Crises. I have 50,000 people on my email list, some already very high-powered, powerful people who—I'm not going to name names—but I know that they're there. And it might seem a little strange, absent context, but I knew immediately that this was basically up to me.\n\nKrugman: Right.\n\nTankus:\n\nSo, you know, more or less, to get the word out there and to race against the clock of whatever DOGE was gonna do and before they actually could get in there, you know? And so taking the opportunity of what I hoped gave me the weekend, like literally just the time of the weekend, hopefully the DOGE kids were going out, you know, doing drugs somewhere else and not actually at the Treasury, and take that opportunity to write as fast as I could, research as fast as I could to have a piece out Monday morning. I successfully accomplished that. I also managed to concurrently have a simpler version of my piece run in Rolling Stone at the same time and, you know, then hit the ground running, made sure to get a haircut Sunday night, had the, you know, brain space to do that because I knew I was going to be doing video interviews the next day.\n\nKrugman: Just to be clear, impoundment is like the director of the Office of Small Animals gets a memo saying no money for rabbits, even though Congress has allocated it. But this is some guy, some 19-year-old or whatever from DOGE gets into the computers and possibly, and we need to talk about this, possibly alters the code so that no money goes out for rabbits or possibly just doesn't know what the hell he's doing and just crashes the system. Is that a fair characterization?\n\nTankus: Exactly. There's one person in Marko Elez, a 25 year old who used to work at SpaceX. He's, you know—as we'll get to—he's out of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service now, but he's just been sent over to the Social Security Administration.\n\nKrugman: Which is wonderful. I'm actually getting checks from the SSA myself now, although it's not important for me, but it's absolutely critical for like 80% of people my age. Before we get a little nonlinear here, but kids. Elez would be like almost the oldest of this team, right? These were real kids. And I've been seeing some theorizing about why are we getting really such young people with often with very questionable things in their backgrounds. What's your take on that? And I'll give you the one I've heard from other people.\n\nTankus: So it's not something I've looked into a ton, but my impression is these are people who adore Elon Musk, are very personally loyal to him, are willing to do some very unusual things because they do not have a professional background. ‘This is cool and awesome and the internet and, you know, I'm a Reddit kid who gets to screw with the federal government in real life.’ I also think these kids are expendable. And also, I think the fact that these kids are kind of racist kids from chat lines who tweet like Marko Elez did to ‘normalize Indian hate’, these things are useful because it means that if things get too hot there's a reason you can get rid of one of these kids. You can cite racist posts which, as we'll get into, is what happened with Marko Elez even though that's not actually why they're getting kicked out of the government, and so it's a perfect shield to make sure that there's as much confusion and obfuscation about just how serious what Musk is doing on behalf of the Trump administration.\n\nKrugman: Yeah, that's not too different. The theory that I heard, Josh Marshall (TalkingPointsMemo.com), has a post on all that, and has said that these guys are being asked to do things that are quite likely illegal and that if you're a 35 year old experienced guy with a background and a career, you could blow up your life. But these are twenty-something-at-most guys who don't have that, who don't themselves have much to lose.\n\nTankus:\n\nYeah.\n\nKrugman:\n\nI don't know if you've seen it, but there's this point in Oppenheimer where’s he’s dealing with General Groves, who pretends to be a dumb general, but is actually not. And he suddenly realizes, ‘you didn't hire me despite my communist connections. You hired me because of them, because that means that you can get rid of me whenever you want.’ Ok, so these kids come in. And what are they doing?\n\nTankus:\n\nWell, first I would just say overwhelmingly, we don't really know. I mean, the full scope of what these people are doing is not very clear. It's, of course, under very unclear authority, likely illegal in so many cases. And so the most dangerous thing is just how little we know. In this case, with Marko Elez getting in there, it seems to be downloading data. For a time, I had sources right in the Bureau of the Fiscal Service office or building where he was bouncing around looking at all these very sensitive systems and my sources could see him download data. But the systems are so sensitive that even senior IT people in these places could see that Marko Elez was downloading data but couldn't see what the data was because these systems are so sensitive, even they don't have access to them.\n\nKrugman: Okay, this downloaded data could be personal information, could be business information, it could be, I mean, the federal government has, you know, as you say, five trillion in spending, so it's got fingers in all kinds of areas, it has information on all kinds of things, so this could be just downloading information that could be used to Elon Musk's business advantage, could be used in various ways to pressure people. So one possibility was simply that they were getting access to data that is supposed to be very carefully protected. As you say, even senior people don't have that kind of access. There was also the question about whether he or some other people were able to—and I understand it's not that clear a distinction—but were able to actually rewrite some of the code. Can you explain to me what we're all talking about there and what the concerns are?\n\nTankus: Yeah, so this is still kind of shrouded in confusion. There should be an independent investigation of what exactly Marko Elez was doing. For a time the Fiscal Service people seemed to be investigating and were very upset about him bouncing around after he was out and were literally treating it like it was a cyber security incident, like it was. Like they had been hacked because in a certain sense they had been. But obviously, the pressure from high up, from Treasury Secretary Bessent kind of squashed that. Even a subcontractor from Booz Allen, who wrote a memo about the cyber security risks, the huge cyber security risk, the dangers of having Marko Elez around, was fired for writing that report. Now there's a court case where people have been testifying under oath about what was going on. So it's still not exactly clear what is happening.\n\nWhat I would emphasize about this, like literally Marko Elez rewriting the code, is in a certain sense, you know, this was important, it was dramatic, it was something that both Wired and I were breaking stories about that was bringing attention and seriousness to it. But at a larger policy level, that kind of thing is kind of a sideshow. I followed along with it to keep attention on the story and to keep the pressure on, but the policy conclusion from my point of view was the same regardless of any of the stories that I broke or not. Because the point of looking at data, even if you only have read access where you can look at the data, is to propose changes. The purpose of even just gaining enough control where you can tell the civil service people what to do, even if they're the ones actually looking at the code, is to get them to do things. One explosive court filing is that already by the time that I had come to find out about this on January 31st, they had been at the payments level of blocking payments, which, what I mean is there's literally these payment files written basically the same way they would be written in the 1970s that get processed through these systems and get sent on to the Federal Reserve to be processed by ACH, Automated Clearing House, which is how any sort of small or medium-sized value payment works. You get a payment from Social Security and it's a direct deposit to your account, it is an ACH payment. That's the system.\n\nAnd they were literally just taking the files and going, ‘we're not handing those over. We're not processing this because we're shutting down USAID.’ And as we know, they've now taken over the building and shut down USAID, but they were also doing that at the payments level. And so with the Hamilton Projects tracker, you can see the payments from USAID go to zero, literally zero January 28th. So they were literally doing this. [nuanced correction of these statements from 03/04/2025 can be found here]\n\nKrugman: So that's before they actually seized the building and told everybody to go home. They actually just stopped the payments. Wow. So I was going to offer a hypothetical, but I don't need to. That's an actual case. They just sort of made the judgment, decided we don't like USAID and without even telling the officials at USAID to stop paying the money or before we get around to that, we just tell the computer to stop making the payments.\n\nTankus: Exactly. And there is an even further incident that the court filings reveal that I reported on last week [two weeks ago] that really flagged the importance that no one had really caught, something even more dramatic and eye opening. Something I would have felt would be too out there for me to have speculated on when I was writing about the worst case scenarios. They had been using these payment codes, what are called treasury account symbols, which is complicated, but basically what it means is you're associating a specific type of payment with a specific type of appropriations, the type of legislation from Congress that authorizes spending. And they figured out what codes related to money for refugees. And they flagged three payments, three appropriations for three payment files related to refugees, funding the administrative expenses of programs to bring literally refugee aid to women and children in other countries, and then a couple others of a similar tenor, and flagged them.\n\nKrugman: Wow.\n\nTankus: Which, you know, sounds technical. But to me, what’s extremely dramatic, is that this spending was not USAID spending. This spending was Health and Human Services Department spending. And so they flagged the payments, the payment files, and sent them back to review. But they did not send them back to Health and Human Services. They've sent them to the State Department for the State Department to look over whether they were consistent with Trump's executive orders. So to really break that down, they were talking to one agency, which maybe they feel like they've already gotten their favorite people in there. ‘You look over and tell us whether we should stop these payments and completely cut out the agency that that spending is, the agency that sent the payment files over.’ So they were already going so far as basically just, ‘we're gonna have essentially our favorite people look and pick and choose what type of appropriations, what type of specific type of spending is gonna go out.’ Now, that spending ultimately did go out according to court documents, but this happened even faster than I thought it had or could have when I was writing about this at the beginning when I was already very, very alarmed about what was going on. And now there are court injunctions against all this stuff, but who knows really where this goes.\n\nKrugman: Okay, and so this is impoundment of anything that, you know, looks like DEI to these guys or whatever. I'm told that even in the military, people who are doing things like transnational cooperation have been renaming it because they're afraid that the word trans will be flagged. But this is whole categories of spending, and it's not even a person who has to say stop it or at some point it has to be reviewed but they're just mucking with the file and stopping payments and no attention to what legislation may say or whatever. That's amazing.\n\nTankus: Yeah, it's truly remarkable. And I really want to emphasize how dramatic this is. I talked about how I wrote about impoundment, what I've been calling ‘part zero’ on January 31st, and talked about the huge disruption of, say, payment portals going down in all 50 states for Medicaid. And that already was extremely serious. But what became clear, and what I wrote about in my Monday article after that Friday, is that was in some sense kind of the OK situation. Because even those 50 state payment portals that went down for a day, they went down because either Health and Human Services could just shut down the portal while they figured out how to comply with the executive orders temporarily, or they directed the bureau, the fiscal service to do it. They didn't just do it from one central point. It was agencies in a confusion figuring out how they could comply and a court can issue a court order and the people at Health and Human Services can choose to follow the court order, follow the law over just what the Trump administration says. You know, in a constitutional crisis, this is the typical thing. You are fighting what I've called bureaucratic trench warfare, agency to agency.\n\nAnd that's why they're sending all these people to physically take over the buildings, to shut off people's emails, all that stuff. And that stuff is hard. It's a pain. It's annoying to have to actually go to try to take control of the federal government. It would be a lot easier if you could just flip a switch and it doesn't matter what those people are doing. And hey, maybe we can flip a switch and get those people to stop being paid. And with those people stop being paid, then they're going to have to quit and go somewhere else. Because they have to live. And it'll be a lot easier to take over the federal government that way. And that is what they were trying to do. You know, what I've called the payments heart of the federal government is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. And they were trying to grab ahold of the payments heart and shut things down. And it seems like for now they are respecting court injunctions. But, you know, for example, the federal judiciary is paid through the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Hypothetically, they could just shut down the federal judiciary from getting paid. And then what happens from there? No expert has an answer for you about what happens from there.\n\nKrugman: Yeah. Okay, we could go further, but I think I want to touch on one last subject, which is the risk of kind of a crack up. You've been talking about that quite a lot. I'll give you my version and then tell me what I've got wrong.\n\nThe Federal government isn’t all slick, state-of-the-art computers and hyper-sophisticated. It's legacy systems and old software, and it's held together with scotch tape and rubber bands. And then you get a bunch of people who weren't born when these things were put in place, and there's a real risk that payment systems just sort of collapse. Have I got that right, kind of?\n\nTankus: Yeah, there is that risk. I think we're past that risk. I think the reaction was dramatic enough. Wired's reporting, my reporting, Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo's reporting, and sort of just a wider outrage, the lawsuits. I think they didn't know what they were playing with, and then they really were kind of taken aback by the strong reaction. And I think they're backing away from that.\n\nKrugman: That's good.\n\nTankus: But in a certain sense, saying ‘OK, the payment system isn't just going to break because Marko Elez decided to hit the wrong button’ is kind of papering over the fact that this constitutional crisis is still extraordinarily serious. And they got even much further quicker than I thought they would be able to. Things are kind of hanging by a thread with them continuing to respect court injunctions. And of course, on an hour to hour basis, on a day to day basis, we don't know how much or whether they're still respecting the court injunctions. And I just hope, I'm really hoping that my sources reach out or more sources reach out if that situation changes.\n\nKrugman: OK, that's slightly, slightly reassuring that at least the immediate risk that some 19-year-old misspells a line of code and Fedwire goes down or something. Does Fedwire still exist? I'm probably showing my age.\n\nTankus: Yes, Fedwire still exists. There's the small, medium-sized payment to the ACH, and then there's Fedwire.\n\nKrugman: Okay, but that the mechanism essentially for doing what you describe, which is just plain cutting off spending on things that, not even necessarily things they don't like, but things that based upon their identifying code might be things they don't like, that that is still there, that there have been court injunctions, but we don't know, and we might not know. How would we? What would be the early warning signs that something really major is happening?\n\nTankus: The early warning signs—and this kind of is really getting into the weeds. You can kind of think of this in a basic way. The Treasury's sending out payments. And so if the Treasury's sending out payments, someone's receiving those payments. And ultimately, if you are getting a social security check, your bank also is getting a payment, and then it follows on and credits your account. Their account is also credited. So there's more of these balances. We can call them settlement balances, or the typical term is reserves, and more of those are sloshing around the banking system. If those payments aren't going out, then they're not sloshing around the banking system. And so every day, banks have access to what are called daylight overdrafts, which is just a fancy way of saying, you can borrow money for 12 hours until, 5 PM or 6 PM that night, or whatever it is. And you know, according to my reporting, talking to former high level Federal Reserve or Treasury officials, our kind of group consensus is that these daylight overdrafts across the banking system would go up a lot. And the issue is, we don't have that data. It’s not reported on an everyday basis. So essentially, I'm hoping, you know, some people are keeping an eye on that, whether they're at the Fed, whether they're banks that notice their own daylight overdrafts going up a lot or even just saying, ‘hey, we've gotten a lot less government ACH payments than we usually do. And someone leaks that information to me or a reporter.\n\nKrugman: Yeah, I was actually wondering who they'd leak it to if not you. I mean, if you get hit by a truck, how do we know if this has happened?\n\nTankus: Well, I'll put this pitch out there. If someone out there who's watching this or reading the transcript wants to put up a budget, $500,000 or a million to train up people and, you know, make me replaceable, I'm more than eager to train up my redundancies. [email me at Crisesnotes@gmail.com or contact me on signal at NathanTankus.01]\n\nKrugman: This will be in the transcript. That's actually, it is scary.\n\nNathan Tankus:\n\nBut I do want to say on that, to your point, I had read your piece about leaving the New York Times. And when I read your piece, and that was before all this broke out, I found reading your piece kind of alarming. Because as you say, newspapers don't really have someone with chops who can know how to read a government report and putting it out there. And you're interviewing me. The stuff I'm talking about is so technical and abstruse and is not something that you can catch on to.\n\nKrugman: There's a kind of middle ground. I'm probably going to be talking about this with some other people as well. There’s straight ‘a man bit a dog on Fifth Avenue’ reporting, which still needs to be done. And then there's the, ‘I was having dinner with some friends and they all said…,’ and the middle ground is analysis, which inevitably has to have a point of view. I'm not sure it was ever really there, but we really need it now and they don't have it. Well, this is not about me. But…\n\nTankus: Well, but it's important because, you know, there's a reason that I'm doing this interview and it's not just because, it's going to be great to have Paul Krugman, you know, a Nobel Memorial Prize winner interview. Obviously, you know, that's meaningful and significant career-wise. But you're exactly the kind of person who serves that role of taking content from what I do and making it even more accessible. And it would be nice if this was, say, in the New York Times or the Washington Post rather than in your own personal newsletter.\n\nKrugman:\n\nWell, newsletters are becoming really critical. Have you read Henry Farrell and Abe Newman's book, Underground Empire? if you haven't then you should. They talk a lot about how much hidden power the United States has because of its control of things like, above all, the global banking system and its ability to disrupt payments when it chooses. And their latest update is, now we're doing it to ourselves. Some pretty amazing stuff.\n\nTankus: Yeah, I think that's absolutely true. I do want to plug that one of the reasons why I was so sensitive to this issue and able to kind of quickly jump on it is that my colleague, a law professor at Willamette University, Rohan Grey, had actually written a draft of a law review article all about making the federal government's internal payment system secure using our updated technologies, what are typically associated with what is now called central bank digital currency. But central banking is not really the essential place we need this. We need this in the Treasury. We need a Treasury issued digital fiat currency. And one of the essential really important things it would do is you could put a secure server in every agency. And so they could send payments directly out to people's wallets that would then get onto the whole banking system without having one bottleneck, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service or the Federal Reserve that could choke off payments and not be able to get payments out of there. And that seemed frankly like an obscure, abstruse idea. Like, OK, maybe that’s a good idea. And now it's one of the most important discussions about a reform proposal if we get out of this. And so I do want to plug that Rohan is fixing up that paper to put it out for late submission, this law review cycle. And I think it's a very important piece to get published.\n\nKrugman: Have him send me a working paper version. I may not be able to understand it all but I usually think I know what actual expertise looks like even if I don't have it myself so…\n\nOkay, this has been fascinating, mostly terrifying, though I guess the shutting down tomorrow by accident appears to be at least somewhat receded. But wow. Thank you so much for talking with me and we'll get this up for the public quite soon. Thanks so much.\n\nTankus: Absolutely. Yeah, thank you.","html":"<p><strong>Notes on the Crises pivoted on February 1st into around the clock coverage of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025.

This is the latest in my series of videos. I thought it would be really interesting to talk to Nathan Tankus, who has ended up playing a really remarkable role in helping to at least make us aware of and possibly take some precautions against what looks like a kind of digital takeover by Elon Musk's people. And we'll get into all of that. But I first want to ask, Nathan, if you could talk a little bit about your background and how you came to be in this position. As I understand it, you're kind of a financial plumbing expert, if we could say that. Would that be a fair description?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah, absolutely.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Were you at the Fed or at the Treasury?</p><p><strong>Tankus: </strong>No, I'm a pure outsider.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: An outsider but you've paid a lot of attention to what they do. We think that management says ‘send money there’ and it just happens but it's actually a very elaborate process, right?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Absolutely. You asked about my background, how I came to this. So I feel like that's an opportunity to go way back in my history. And for me, this all started in January 2009. I'm 33 so in January 2009 I was still in high school and I went to a kind of <a href=\"https://www.friendsofurban.org/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>small alternative public high school called Urban Academy</u></a> and I had two teachers who just taught a class called Show Me the Money where we read selections of the newspaper each week. We read, I don't know, probably a dozen Paul Krugman blog posts or columns and I started reading your blog every day, among a whole bunch of other blogs, and I just became obsessed. So I'm one of these people who was really kind of woken up by the Great Financial Crisis and it captured their imagination and just rolled with that. I've kind of bounced around a lot of different things since then, but in meantime, picked up a lot of knowledge where I got to the point where I was actually asking such kind of interesting detailed questions where people, even former treasury or federal reserve people, would be willing to talk to me because I was asking the kind of questions that no one else was asking. And so that 15 year journey, which involved, like, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-02/nathan-tankus-s-newsletter-subscribers-don-t-care-about-diplomas?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>a big success during the beginning of coronavirus</u></a>, has kind of brought me to this place, this unique position to be able to write about these kinds of things.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Just tell me what was the success with coronavirus?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: I started my newsletter Notes on the Crises on March 19th, 2020, because it was clear to me that there was going to be a lot of economic impacts. There already were at that point, but there were going to be a lot more and they weren't very well understood. And anyone who had any sort of expertise or knowledge with what the Federal Reserve was doing, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-reserves-coronavirus-468/\"><u>what were called “crisis facilities,”</u></a> where they launched these suites of programs that were going to support the financial system, support municipalities, state and local government, support the corporate sector, and that anyone who had detailed knowledge of those programs was either in government, at a think tank (and thus had to be doing all sorts of things assigned by their bosses), a journalist who was too busy covering the big picture stuff to get into the details, or was a professor who was trying to figure out how to teach on Zoom suddenly in the middle of a semester. And so I had a unique opportunity as someone who was kind of a total outsider, did not have a nine to five job that made me commit to doing some other set of activities. So I could just devote all my time to writing about it. That first four months, I wrote a piece every other day, including weekends on average. Just, you know, that first month I put out 21 pieces and that sort of big rush is what made my career. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-02/nathan-tankus-s-newsletter-subscribers-don-t-care-about-diplomas?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Bloomberg Business Week did a profile on me</u></a>. So in a strange way, I've kind of already had this experience that I've been having for the past month, but obviously this month has been much more intense and much more dramatic.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: OK, we stepped up to help people through this—what I was calling a ‘medically induced coma for the economy’ during Covid. But that involved trying to get money out in unusual, unprecedented ways and presumably was technically very demanding. And you were writing about that then.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Absolutely. I was largely <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-reserves-coronavirus-468/\"><u>focused on the Federal Reserve</u></a>, but I had interest in other things, including state unemployment insurance and actually how, as we'll get to in a bit, related to this, how their COBOL systems made updating them very technically complex. So for example, why the unemployment insurance checks were an additional $600 a week, rather than say, “We're going to replace 80% of your income.” It was just too technically complicated in the time available to program 80% or replacement rates. And so they just slapped on adding $600 a week to everyone's check because that was technically easier.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: That's interesting. I knew that the number 600 was based on average earnings. But I didn't think about why it was a fixed number... But yeah, I do remember the state of New Jersey, which is where I was at the time, putting out a desperate appeal for people who knew how to program in COBOL. Because basically nobody knows how to do that anymore.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah. I desperately tried to get my dad to take up New Jersey's call, but he had just retired December 2019 and he had no interest whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: So you were looking at the Fed's efforts. I know that obviously the Fed has to have been doing extraordinary stuff to maintain liquidity, but I wasn't really paying attention to that side of it. Just a word or two, maybe too technical for a lot of people, but just what were they doing that was especially unusual and difficult?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: The vast majority of the programs that they launched were similar to <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-reserves-coronavirus/\"><u>programs that they had launched in 2008</u></a> in response to the great financial crisis. And so these were a suite of programs that were designed to do what worked in normal times: preserve liquidity to the banking system and wider financial markets. Normally you just rely on financial market participants to do that and the Fed is operating quietly in the background as a backstop, and they had to take on that explicitly. So, normally you provide liquidity to the banking system. The banking system makes sure that wider financial market participants have liquidity. They make sure that say, you know, corporate bonds are liquid and that, you know, corporations can borrow at a pretty reasonable rate or rather a rate that is in line with the Fed's broader monetary policy. But all of the sort of creaking conditions of financial markets breaking down in response to the disruptions expected by COVID meant that what the Fed usually does implicitly, it felt like it had to do explicitly. So it launched a primary corporate credit market facility and a secondary corporate credit market facility, which is really just a fancy way of saying they directly lent to corporations or they bought corporate debt off of financial market participants who had this corporate debt, or anyone who really needed to sell it. And they launched those kind of programs for state and local governments all across the board.</p><p>They just made sure that anyone who needed liquidity essentially had it and that if things were going to break down, they were going to break down by COVID's direct effects and not by not being able to borrow money.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: For listeners, I know a little bit, but only a little bit about this. In normal times, certainly the way that textbooks teach it, the Fed buys treasury bills from banks. That's how the Fed gets money out into the economy, which is straightforward. But when everything is breaking down, they can't count on the money actually getting out there to where it's needed. I knew people who worked on their commercial paper facility in 2009, which was basically, roughly speaking, small business lending. Normally the Fed would just put money into the banks and expect it to find its way, but the market wasn't working. So the Fed was doing this on a much wider scale. And you were tracking how they were actually doing this, so, paying attention to the specific programs.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Absolutely. I wrote <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-reserves-coronavirus-468/\"><u>this big seven part series on all the details where</u></a>, literally, I went through every press release that the Federal Reserve released since the beginning of February, 2020, and just tried to provide a simple-as-possible explanation of every single press release. And that kind of comprehensive detailed painstaking work got a lot of attention.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: That's really interesting. Last week I did a conversation with Jim Chanos, the famous short seller, and he would base his research, not on having spies, but on actually just taking stuff that was in the public domain, but actually reading it. It sounds like that's what you were doing.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Absolutely. That is definitely the kind of approach that I've developed to understanding things. And I've kind of reached the point of reading whatever's in the public domain in detail enough that people want to talk to me. I've now reached the point where I've read so much of that stuff that the bankers and former Fed and Treasury and maybe current people want to talk to me.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Okay. Is there something else you want to tell us about the background before we move up to the current crisis?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: I think that is it. I think the one thing I would say is, I'm known as a Federal Reserve person because I did that big thing during coronavirus. I'm known as a Fed person. And so to some people, it's a little strange getting into what we're going to talk about, where it seems kind of the Fed's there, but it's in the background. It's a side detail in this story, which maybe will unfortunately become more important in the coming months. And so people are kind of like, well, what is this? And I kind of have a general interest in payment systems, in the monetary system, in the financial system, how Congress's budgetary process works, you know, kind of all of these things in all of their complex interrelations. And that's a lot of what my colleagues and I do at the Modern Money Network, where I'm a research director.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Okay. You were doing the Fed back then, but Treasury also has a part. Obviously, there's a lot of plumbing involved. If the Secretary of the Treasury says issue checks to a bunch of people and Treasury Secretary says ‘make it so,’ what I hadn't realized was there is basically an agency, an office, there's a particular relatively small unit in Treasury that makes that happen. What's that? A bureau. The bureau of the treasury, which is actually kind of what for normal, inaccurate language, kind of cuts the checks, right? Is that a fair description?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Absolutely. That's a fair description, Paul.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: And their normal role is simple. They don't verify whether something is a good policy. That's not their job. They don't verify whether the people are deserving. They just sort of verify whether this has been authorized. Is that right?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah, that's exactly correct. You can kind of think about it with your bank. If you write a check and say, ‘I've got to pay this bill, I've got to pay my utility bill,’ maybe they can tell from the name of the company that it's your utility company. But they don't say, ‘hey, what type of thing are you spending on? Is this for alcohol? I don't think that is good for you. We're going to have this check bounce. You're going to have to pay a whole bunch of fees because you're not supposed to be buying that.’ That's exactly what we generally don't want a payment system to do. We don't want there to be like a Payments Big Brother that tells us ‘you can have this, but you can't have that.’ The example I used in one of my articles is, conservatives don't want there to be some liberal person in the payment system limiting how much meat you can buy in a month.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: If you are using a debit card, they do have fraud algorithms, departments, that will flag a transaction as looking like the kind of thing you usually don’t buy or doesn't look like your spending. So I'll get a text and say, ‘respond yes or no,’ which is, I guess, a protection. But anyway, there may be a little bit of that going on here as well but basically, ‘does it look like a properly authorized payment,’ right?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah, that's a great example, actually, because, you know, we'll get into more of the details in a second of the various other systems. But when this bureau, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, sends out payments, it doesn't just actually [just] send out a payment. It checks a payment. It does a final check. You know, there's supposed to be other processes that check, but they do a last check against a system which is <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-asked-former-bureau-of-the-fiscal-service-employees-to-interpret-an-elon-musk-tweet/\"><u>called officially the Do Not Pay system</u></a>. And there's various parts of this system which flags if, you know, ‘is the person getting this check dead,’ that kind of thing. But, if you get flagged by Do Not Pay, they don't then say, ‘Well, alright, this payment's not going out.’ All that is just a check, and then they send it back to the agency. The same way that you get that text message that says, ‘hey, did you really mean to make this payment?’ They send it back to the agency and say, ‘hey, did you really mean to make this payment?’ Or maybe there's an issue with this payment. ‘Look further into it.’ But if the agency comes back and goes, ‘Hey. No, this payment is legit. Send this payment.’ They're not going to overrule them. And so this system <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-asked-former-bureau-of-the-fiscal-service-employees-to-interpret-an-elon-musk-tweet/\"><u>does it in a more complicated way but does the same thing as your bank</u></a>, saying, ‘hey, did you really mean to make that debit card transaction?’</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Okay. And by the way, sometimes it works, you know? There was somebody ordering basically from the equivalent of Uber Eats, but in Britain and was ordering Indian food in a suburb of London on my card. That was not me.</p><p>But, okay, how big is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service? How many people are we talking about roughly? It's quite tiny, right?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: I don't have the employment right off the top of my head, but I would guess, like, let's call it 2,000 - 3,000 people [Editorial note, I was close. They had nearly 2000 “Full Time Equivalent” employees <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/17.-Fiscal-FY-2021-BIB.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>in Fiscal Year 2020 &amp; 2021</u></a> and <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/14.-BFS-FY-2025-BIB.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>1826 in Fiscal Year 2024</u></a>] and it handles around $5 trillion of payments.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: So this is really quite a small agency, but its job is not to decide what's a good payment. Okay, so you became aware that some of Elon Musk's people were getting access to this Bureau. Tell me what was... it was actually just news stories, right? So, what did Nathan Tankus know and how did he know it?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Friday, January 31st, I had just put <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>out a big piece about how we already were in a constitutional crisis</u></a>. I described a five alarm fire constitutional crisis. There had just been this implementation memo from the Office of Management and Budget directing a sweeping freezing of spending across the federal government until the Trump administration could review it. This caused immediate chaos. The Medicaid portals to send payments out through Medicaid went down. This had caused such an immediate disruption that they had to rescind the memo, but they hadn't rescinded the executive orders that were driving this memo. And so I wrote a long piece about why this is a big deal. Why, what's called impoundment, which is not spending what Congress directs or <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>appropriates to be spent, is a big deal</u></a>, why it's a constitutional crisis, why it is like a fundamental demotion of Congress's role in our constitutional system. So I was already focused on this issue and I was already pretty concerned.</p><p>You know, my newsletter is called Notes on the Crises. So, I'm paying attention to crisis. Crisis is, you know, when people are really reading my articles and when you're really getting a lot of them, that's when you know something's really, really wrong, you know? So I was already focused on this. And <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/31/elon-musk-treasury-department-payment-systems/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>in an article in the Washington Post I had seen a headline</u></a> about how a high level person in the Treasury had resigned in protest or is on leave or something, but related to the treasury's payment system. And as a payments expert, that headline was incredibly alarming. So alarming, in fact, that I put it aside and I couldn't get myself to read it for a few hours. I had gotten caught up with promoting my piece that day, so I hadn't eaten that day. So I was like, ‘I'm gonna go get something to eat.’</p><p>And my friend, colleague, t<a href=\"https://stephaniekelton.substack.com/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>he economist Stephanie Kelton at Stony Brook</u></a>, when I told her that, she had already read the article and was already alarmed. She said, ‘I don't think that's the right order.’ But nevertheless, I hadn't eaten that day. So I went to go eat, and then I went to go read it. I mean, literally, four paragraphs into this article,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u> I had a panic attack</u></a>. It was possibly the scariest or one of the scariest moments of my life when I read that article. And it was so scary to me because what the article said was that the Fiscal Assistant Secretary, who's the highest civil servant in the treasury, where everyone above him are political appointees. You know, there's that top layer of every agency which are political appointees that, you might fire the old people, you fire the Biden administration or the Trump people, and you bring in your people. That’s a normal expected part of government. But everyone below them are supposed to be professional civil servants who were doing the job regardless of the partisan status of the executive branch, regardless of who is president. And the fact that this person had been pushed out because DOGE and Elon Musk in the Department of Government Efficiency <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>were asking to have access to the Treasury and this guy</u></a>, a long time official, someone who'd been in the government since 1989, had been in this highest status position since 10 years ago had been widely credited as the person who has expertly managed the treasury and payments throughout the various debt ceiling crises where you're trying to squeeze every dollar and make sure payments go out without breaching the debt ceiling. I immediately understood how desperately serious and what the worst case scenarios could be and was overwhelmed by it. And I was also overwhelmed and alarmed as an expert in this area that so few people understood how serious this was that it was, and that it was going to be, that it's not just that this was so dangerous, but that there was very few people who were in a position to really say anything about this. And to be frank, my newsletter is called Notes on the Crises. I have 50,000 people on my email list, some already very high-powered, powerful people who—I'm not going to name names—but I know that they're there. And it might seem a little strange, absent context, but I knew immediately that this was basically up to me.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Right.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>:</p><p>So, you know, more or less, to get the word out there and to race against the clock of whatever DOGE was gonna do and before they actually could get in there, you know? And so taking the opportunity of what I hoped gave me the weekend, like literally just the time of the weekend, hopefully the DOGE kids were going out, you know, doing drugs somewhere else and not actually at the Treasury, and take that opportunity to write as fast as I could, research as fast as I could to have a piece out Monday morning. I <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>successfully accomplished that</u></a>. I also managed to concurrently have a <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-elon-musk-treasury-payment-system-dangerous-1235254831?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>simpler version of my piece run in Rolling Stone</u></a> at the same time and, you know, then hit the ground running, made sure to get a haircut Sunday night, had the, you know, brain space to do that because I knew I was going to be doing video interviews the next day.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Just to be clear, impoundment is like the director of the Office of Small Animals gets a memo saying no money for rabbits, even though Congress has allocated it. But this is some guy, some 19-year-old or whatever from DOGE gets into the computers and possibly, and we need to talk about this, possibly alters the code so that no money goes out for rabbits or possibly just doesn't know what the hell he's doing and just crashes the system. Is that a fair characterization?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Exactly. There's <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-six-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025/\"><u>one person in Marko Elez</u></a>, a 25 year old who used to work at SpaceX. He's, you know—as we'll get to—he's out of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service now, but he's just been sent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/doge-staffer-behind-racist-posts-reappears-at-social-security?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>over to the Social Security Administration.</u></a></p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Which is wonderful. I'm actually getting checks from the SSA myself now, although it's not important for me, but it's absolutely critical for like 80% of people my age. Before we get a little nonlinear here, but kids. Elez would be like almost the oldest of this team, right? These were real kids. And I've been seeing some theorizing about why are we getting really such young people with often with very questionable things in their backgrounds. What's your take on that? And I'll give you the one I've heard from other people.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: So it's not something I've looked into a ton, but my impression is these are people who adore Elon Musk, are very personally loyal to him, are willing to do some very unusual things because they do not have a professional background. ‘This is cool and awesome and the internet and, you know, I'm a Reddit kid who gets to screw with the federal government in real life.’ I also think these kids are expendable. And also, I think the fact that these kids are kind of racist kids from chat lines who tweet like Marko Elez did to ‘normalize Indian hate’, these things are useful because it means that if things get too hot there's a reason you can get rid of one of these kids. You can cite racist posts which, as we'll get into, is <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-eleven-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-marko-elezs-resignation-return-and-irrelevance/\"><u>what happened with Marko Elez</u></a> even though that's not actually why they're getting kicked out of the government, and so it's a perfect shield to make sure that there's as much confusion and obfuscation about just how serious what Musk is doing on behalf of the Trump administration.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Yeah, that's not too different. The theory that I heard, Josh Marshall (TalkingPointsMemo.com), has a post on all that, and has said that these guys are being asked to do things that are quite likely illegal and that if you're a 35 year old experienced guy with a background and a career, you could blow up your life. But these are twenty-something-at-most guys who don't have that, who don't themselves have much to lose.</p><p><strong>Tankus:</strong></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Krugman:</strong></p><p>I don't know if you've seen it, but there's this point in <em>Oppenheimer</em> where’s he’s dealing with General Groves, who pretends to be a dumb general, but is actually not. And he suddenly realizes, ‘you didn't hire me despite my communist connections. You hired me because of them, because that means that you can get rid of me whenever you want.’ Ok, so these kids come in. And what are they doing?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>:</p><p>Well, first I would just say overwhelmingly, we don't really know. I mean, the full scope of what these people are doing is not very clear. It's, of course, under very unclear authority, likely illegal in so many cases. And so the most dangerous thing is just how little we know. In this case<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>, with Marko Elez getting</u></a> in there, it seems to be downloading data. For a time, I had sources right in the Bureau of the Fiscal Service office or building where he was bouncing around looking at all these very sensitive systems and my sources <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>could see him download data</u></a>. But the systems are so sensitive that even senior IT people in these places could see that Marko Elez was downloading data but couldn't see what the data was because these systems are so sensitive, even they don't have access to them.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Okay, this downloaded data could be personal information, could be business information, it could be, I mean, the federal government has, you know, as you say, five trillion in spending, so it's got fingers in all kinds of areas, it has information on all kinds of things, so this could be just downloading information that could be used to Elon Musk's business advantage, could be used in various ways to pressure people. So one possibility was simply that they were getting access to data that is supposed to be very carefully protected. As you say, even senior people don't have that kind of access. There was also the question about whether he or some other people were able to—and I understand it's not that clear a distinction—but were able to actually rewrite some of the code. Can you explain to me what we're all talking about there and what the concerns are?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah, so this is still kind of shrouded in confusion. There should be an independent investigation of what exactly Marko Elez was doing. For a time the Fiscal Service people seemed to be investigating and were very upset about him bouncing around after he was out and were literally treating it like it was a cyber security incident, like it was. Like they had been hacked because in a certain sense they had been. But obviously, the pressure from high up, from Treasury Secretary Bessent kind of squashed that. Even a subcontractor from Booz Allen, who wrote a memo about the cyber security risks, the huge cyber security risk, the dangers of having Marko Elez around, was fired for writing that report. Now there's a court case where people have been testifying under oath about what was going on. So it's still not exactly clear what is happening.</p><p>What I would emphasize about this, like literally Marko Elez rewriting the code, is in a certain sense, you know, this was important, it was dramatic, it was something <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>that both Wired and I were breaking stories about</u></a> that was bringing attention and seriousness to it. But at a larger policy level, that kind of thing is kind of a sideshow. I followed along with it to keep attention on the story and to keep the pressure on, but the policy conclusion from my point of view was the same regardless of any of the stories that I broke or not. Because the point of looking at data, even if you only have read access where you can look at the data, is to propose changes. The purpose of even just gaining enough control where you can tell the civil service people what to do, even if they're the ones actually looking at the code, is to get them to do things. <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>One explosive court filing</u></a> is that already by the time that I had come to find out about this on January 31st, they had been at the payments level of blocking payments, which, what I mean is there's literally these payment files written basically the same way they would be written in the 1970s that get processed through these systems and get sent on to the Federal Reserve to be processed by ACH, Automated Clearing House, which is how any sort of small or medium-sized value payment works. You get a payment from Social Security and it's a direct deposit to your account, it is an ACH payment. That's the system.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>And they were literally just taking</u></a> the files and going, ‘we're not handing those over. We're not processing this because we're shutting down USAID.’ And as we know, they've now taken over the building and shut down USAID, but they were also doing that at the payments level. And <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/how-can-we-know-if-government-payments-stop-an-exploratory-analysis-of-banking-system-warning-signs/\"><u>so with the Hamilton Projects tracker</u></a>, you can see the payments from USAID go to zero, literally zero January 28th. So they were literally doing this. [nuanced correction of these statements from <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/mini-roundup-nuanced-correction-of-krugman-interview-two-columbia-law-professors-in-the-u-of-chicago-law-review-on-my-foia-project-attending-bloomberg-invest/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">03/04/2025 can be found here</a>]</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: So that's before they actually seized the building and told everybody to go home. They actually just stopped the payments. Wow. So I was going to offer a hypothetical, but I don't need to. That's an actual case. They just sort of made the judgment, decided we don't like USAID and without even telling the officials at USAID to stop paying the money or before we get around to that, we just tell the computer to stop making the payments.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Exactly. And there is an even further incident that the court filings reveal that I reported on last week [<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>two weeks ago</u></a>] that really flagged the importance that no one had really caught, something even more dramatic and eye opening. Something I would have felt would be too out there for me to have speculated on when I was writing about the worst case scenarios. They had been using these payment codes, what are called treasury account symbols, which is complicated, but basically what it means is you're associating a specific type of payment with a specific type of appropriations, the type of legislation from Congress that authorizes spending. And they figured out what codes related to money for refugees. And <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>they flagged three payments, three appropriations for three payment files related to refugees</u></a>, funding the administrative expenses of programs to bring literally refugee aid to women and children in other countries, and then a couple others of a similar tenor, and flagged them.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Wow.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Which, you know, sounds technical. But to me, what’s extremely dramatic, is that this spending was not USAID spending. This spending was <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>Health and Human Services Department spending</u></a>. And so they flagged the payments, the payment files, and sent them back to review. But they did not send them back to Health and Human Services. They've sent them to the State Department for the State Department to look over whether they were consistent with Trump's executive orders. So to really break that down, they were talking to one agency, which maybe they feel like they've already gotten their favorite people in there. ‘You look over and tell us whether we should stop these payments and completely cut out the agency that that spending is, the agency that sent the payment files over.’ So they were already going so far as basically just, ‘we're gonna have essentially our favorite people look and pick and choose what type of appropriations, what type of specific type of spending is gonna go out.’ Now, that spending ultimately did go out according to court documents, but this happened even faster than I thought it had or could have when I was writing about this at the beginning when I was already very, very alarmed about what was going on. And now there are court injunctions against all this stuff, but who knows really where this goes.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Okay, and so this is impoundment of anything that, you know, looks like DEI to these guys or whatever. I'm told that even in the military, people who are doing things like transnational cooperation have been renaming it because they're afraid that the word trans will be flagged. But this is whole categories of spending, and it's not even a person who has to say stop it or at some point it has to be reviewed but they're just mucking with the file and stopping payments and no attention to what legislation may say or whatever. That's amazing.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah, it's truly remarkable. And I really want to emphasize how dramatic this is. I talked <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>about how I wrote about impoundment</u></a>, what I've been calling ‘part zero’ on January 31st, and talked about the huge disruption of, say, payment portals going down in all 50 states for Medicaid. And that already was extremely serious. But what became clear, and <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>what I wrote about in my Monday article after that Friday</u></a>, is that was in some sense kind of the OK situation. Because even those 50 state payment portals that went down for a day, they went down because either Health and Human Services could just shut down the portal while they figured out how to comply with the executive orders temporarily, or they directed the bureau, the fiscal service to do it. They didn't just do it from one central point. It was agencies in a confusion figuring out how they could comply and a court can issue a court order and the people at Health and Human Services can choose to follow the court order, follow the law over just what the Trump administration says. You know, in a constitutional crisis, this is the typical thing. You are fighting what I've called bureaucratic trench warfare, agency to agency.</p><p>And that's why they're sending all these people to physically take over the buildings, to shut off people's emails, all that stuff. And that stuff is hard. It's a pain. It's annoying to have to actually go to try to take control of the federal government. It would be a lot easier if you could just flip a switch and it doesn't matter what those people are doing. And hey, maybe we can flip a switch and get those people to stop being paid. And with those people stop being paid, then they're going to have to quit and go somewhere else. Because they have to live. And it'll be a lot easier to take over the federal government that way. And that is what they were trying to do. You know, what I've called the payments heart of the federal government is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. And they were trying to grab ahold of the payments heart and shut things down. And it seems like for now they are respecting court injunctions. But, you know, for example, the federal judiciary is paid through the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Hypothetically, they could just shut down the federal judiciary from getting paid. And then what happens from there? No expert has an answer for you about what happens from there.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Yeah. Okay, we could go further, but I think I want to touch on one last subject, which is the risk of kind of a crack up. You've been talking about that quite a lot. I'll give you my version and then tell me what I've got wrong.</p><p>The Federal government isn’t all slick, state-of-the-art computers and hyper-sophisticated. It's legacy systems and old software, and it's held together with scotch tape and rubber bands. And then you get a bunch of people who weren't born when these things were put in place, and there's a real risk that payment systems just sort of collapse. Have I got that right, kind of?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah, there is that risk. I think we're past that risk. I think the reaction was dramatic enough. <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>Wired's reporting, my reporting, Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo's reporting</u></a>, and sort of just a wider outrage, the lawsuits. I think they didn't know what they were playing with, and then they really were kind of taken aback by the strong reaction. And I think they're backing away from that.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: That's good.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: But in a certain sense, saying ‘OK, the payment system isn't just going to break because Marko Elez decided to hit the wrong button’ is kind of papering over the fact that this constitutional crisis is still extraordinarily serious. And they got even much further quicker than I thought they would be able to. Things are kind of hanging by a thread with them continuing to respect court injunctions. And of course, on an hour to hour basis, on a day to day basis, we don't know how much or whether they're still respecting the court injunctions. And I just hope, I'm really hoping that my sources reach out or more sources reach out if that situation changes.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: OK, that's slightly, slightly reassuring that at least the immediate risk that some 19-year-old misspells a line of code and Fedwire goes down or something. Does Fedwire still exist? I'm probably showing my age.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yes, Fedwire still exists. There's the small, medium-sized payment to the ACH, and then there's Fedwire.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Okay, but that the mechanism essentially for doing what you describe, which is just plain cutting off spending on things that, not even necessarily things they don't like, but things that based upon their identifying code might be things they don't like, that that is still there, that there have been court injunctions, but we don't know, and we might not know. How would we? What would be the early warning signs that something really major is happening?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: The early warning signs—and <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/how-can-we-know-if-government-payments-stop-an-exploratory-analysis-of-banking-system-warning-signs/\"><u>this kind of is really getting into the weeds</u></a>. You can kind of think of this in a basic way. The Treasury's sending out payments. And so if the Treasury's sending out payments, someone's receiving those payments. And ultimately, if you are getting a social security check, your bank also is getting a payment, and then it follows on and credits your account. Their account is also credited. So there's more of these balances. We can call them settlement balances, or the typical term is reserves, and more of those are sloshing around the banking system. If those payments aren't going out, then they're not sloshing around the banking system. And so every day, banks have access to <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/how-can-we-know-if-government-payments-stop-an-exploratory-analysis-of-banking-system-warning-signs/\"><u>what are called daylight overdrafts</u></a>, which is just a fancy way of saying, you can borrow money for 12 hours until, 5 PM or 6 PM that night, or whatever it is. And you know, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/how-can-we-know-if-government-payments-stop-an-exploratory-analysis-of-banking-system-warning-signs/\"><u>according to my reporting</u></a>, talking to former high level Federal Reserve or Treasury officials, our kind of group consensus is that these daylight overdrafts across the banking system would go up a lot. And the issue is, we don't have that data. It’s not reported on an everyday basis. So essentially, I'm hoping, you know, some people are keeping an eye on that, whether they're at the Fed, whether they're banks that notice their own daylight overdrafts going up a lot or even just saying, ‘hey, we've gotten a lot less government ACH payments than we usually do. And someone leaks that information to me or a reporter.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Yeah, I was actually wondering who they'd leak it to if not you. I mean, if you get hit by a truck, how do we know if this has happened?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Well, I'll put this pitch out there. If someone out there who's watching this or reading the transcript wants to put up a budget, $500,000 or a million to train up people and, you know, make me replaceable, I'm more than eager to train up my redundancies. [email me at <a href=\"mailto:Crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><u>Crisesnotes@gmail.com</u></a> or contact me on signal at NathanTankus.01]</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: This will be in the transcript. That's actually, it is scary.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong></p><p>But I do want to say on that, to your point, I had read your piece about <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/leaving-the-new-york-times?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>leaving the New York Times</u></a>. And when I read your piece, and that was before all this broke out, I found reading your piece kind of alarming. Because as you say, newspapers don't really have someone with chops who can know how to read a government report and putting it out there. And you're interviewing <em>me</em>. The stuff I'm talking about is so technical and abstruse and is not something that you can catch on to.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: There's a kind of middle ground. I'm probably going to be talking about this with some other people as well. There’s straight ‘<em>a man bit a dog on Fifth Avenue’</em> reporting, which still needs to be done. And then there's the, ‘I was having dinner with some friends and they all said…,’ and the middle ground is analysis, which inevitably has to have a point of view. I'm not sure it was ever really there, but we really need it now and they don't have it. Well, this is not about me. But…</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Well, but it's important because, you know, there's a reason that I'm doing this interview and it's not just because, it's going to be great to have Paul Krugman, you know, a Nobel Memorial Prize winner interview. Obviously, you know, that's meaningful and significant career-wise. But you're exactly the kind of person who serves that role of taking content from what I do and making it even more accessible. And it would be nice if this was, say, in the New York Times or the Washington Post rather than in your own personal newsletter.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>:</p><p>Well, newsletters are becoming really critical. Have you read Henry Farrell and Abe Newman's book, <em>Underground Empire</em>? if you haven't then you should. They talk a lot about how much hidden power the United States has because of its control of things like, above all, the global banking system and its ability to disrupt payments when it chooses. And their latest update is, now we're doing it to ourselves. Some pretty amazing stuff.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah, I think that's absolutely true. I do want to plug that one of the reasons why I was so sensitive to this issue and able to kind of quickly jump on it is that my colleague, <a href=\"https://rohangrey.net/writing/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>a law professor at Willamette University, Rohan Grey</u></a>, had actually written a draft of a law review article all about making the federal government's internal payment system secure using our updated technologies, what are typically associated with what is now called central bank digital currency. But central banking is not really the essential place we need this. We need this in the Treasury. We need a <a href=\"https://rohangrey.net/files/testimony-6-15-21-written.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Treasury issued digital fiat currency</u></a>. And one of the essential really important things it would do is you could put a secure server in every agency. And so they could send payments directly out to people's wallets that would then get onto the whole banking system without having one bottleneck, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service or the Federal Reserve that could choke off payments and not be able to get payments out of there. And that seemed frankly like an obscure, abstruse idea. Like, OK, maybe that’s a good idea. And now it's one of the most important discussions about a reform proposal if we get out of this. And so I do want to plug that Rohan is fixing up that paper to put it out for late submission, this law review cycle. And I think it's a very important piece to get published.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Have him send me a working paper version. I may not be able to understand it all but I usually think I know what actual expertise looks like even if I don't have it myself so…</p><p>Okay, this has been fascinating, mostly terrifying, though I guess the shutting down tomorrow by accident appears to be at least somewhat receded. But wow. Thank you so much for talking with me and we'll get this up for the public quite soon. Thanks so much.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Absolutely.

Now that Elon Musk and Donald Trump are set to visit Fort Knox, the famous home of the United States Treasury’s gold stock, it's time to write about it. You might be asking yourself, well wait how do these topics relate? Amazingly, they are intimately and causally connected. Visiting Fort Knox is a publicity stunt to get Congress to back an accounting gimmick that will fund the Bitcoin reserve. It is, as the title of this piece says, A scam built atop an accounting gimmick wrapped in bullshit. Now let me explain how.\n\nThe stated reason Musk and Trump are visiting Fort Knox is to “make sure the gold is still there”. Trump, for example, has said in a speech (and really more than one speech) “We're going to open up the doors. I'm going to see we have gold there. We want to find out, did anybody steal the gold in Fort Knox?” This, of course, originated with Musk who has been tweeting about this nonstop. Take, for example, a tweet from last week where he says “Looking for the gold at Fort Knox …” and includes an image of a meme based on a scene in a South Park episode where a character says “Annnd It’s Gone”.\n\nWhile visiting Fort Knox is likely meant to boost Musk’s twitter by livestreaming the visit on the platform and plays to conspiracy minded Trump supporters who have theories about Fort Knox’s gold, these are not the substantive underlying reasons. The underlying reason is most likely the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve proposal. We’ll get to what this proposal is later, for now we’ll start with the gold connection. For new readers this will be an introduction to a major theme of this newsletter- the surprisingly important but neglected field we might label the “Law and Political Economy of Governmental Accounting Gimmicks”\n\nIn fact, during the summer of 2023 I started working on an extremely long and exhaustive history entitled “The Treasury and Federal Reserve’s 70 Year History of ‘Accounting Gimmicks’ and ‘Legal Tricks’ to Avoid the Debt Ceiling and Default.”. In subsequent research that fall I updated it to an “85 year history” when I came across a fascinating episode during Roosevelt’s administration where he wanted to use a wide array of accounting gimmicks to avoid raising the debt ceiling in 1939- right at the beginning of the modern debt ceiling. That history was so long and sprawling I got pulled away from finishing it and publishing it. I hope to get it done in the next couple of months during a period where things hopefully are a little less hectic in Notes on the Crises. A part of that article is about gold and how in the current organization of our legal system, the Treasury’s gold holdings are not actually about the gold market at all- they are about intragovernmental accounting.\n\nSubscribe\n\nReaders of my colleague and friend, economist Stephanie Kelton, will have already gotten a preview of my research in her article on Monday on the Trump-Musk Fort Knox visit. Here’s what I wrote on this basic gimmick two years ago in that unpublished manuscript:\n\nFirst up, we have the oldest example I will discuss today: “monetizing” gold. The history of the U.S. holdings of gold is long, complex and beyond the scope of this piece. For today’s purposes, the main thing that matters is that the United States government has lots of gold and the Treasury has a handy way of filling up its bank account based on that gold without changing anything at all. Instead of having to actually physically transfer gold, the Treasury can issue “gold certificates” based on its gold holdings. Even better, it doesn’t have to sell those gold certificates on the private market. It can just sell them directly to the Federal Reserve.\n\nAs the New York Federal Reserve’s longtime “in house” historian Kenneth Garbade put it: “The action did not affect monetary policy—it merely replaced one asset (the Treasury notes) with another (the gold certificates) on the Fed’s books”. You could replace “gold certificates” with “platinum coins” and nothing would be fundamentally different. What matters is that this is an intragovernmental accounting change which changes nothing of substance for the rest of the economy- except avoiding government default as a result of the debt ceiling.\n\nThe key to understanding this is the Federal Reserve is not going to be selling these gold certificates to the private sector. Nor is it, or anyone else, going to “cash them in” for the gold. \n\nSo if the certificates are just a book entry in some accounting ledger, why does it matter that they are “gold” certificates? Couldn’t you just sell a “avoiding the debt ceiling” certificate which promised redemption in “avoiding-the-debt-ceiling brownie points”? The answer is- yes. The Treasury would just need legal authorization to issue “avoiding the debt ceiling” certificates. This only sounds sillier than gold certificates because it's more honest. The key to bullshit is it sounds good to the uninitiated and nothing sounds better to those who don’t know much about finance than gold.\n\nIn this sense, using the legal authority to mint a Trillion Dollar Platinum coin is the opposite of bullshit. Those of us who long advocated using this legal authority to avoid default frankly acknowledge that it's an accounting gimmick and use the opportunity to educate the public about money, rather than dupe it. Just last month I released a 2013 Federal Reserve memo I got through FOIA about what the Fed would do in case of a debt ceiling driven default. In that article I provided a refresher that linked to myriad pieces I’ve written on this topic the past five years, so please check that out if you’re unfamiliar with what I am referencing.\n\nWhich brings us back to the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. This legislation takes advantage of just how good gold sounds to the laymen (emphasis on “men”…) to propose funding the “Bitcoin Purchase Program” with Gold Certificates. Bitcoin acquired in the “Bitcoin Purchase Program” goes into the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve that will involve “cold storage” of bitcoin. Yes really. The legislation actually goes further and has the Federal Reserve hand over its existing gold certificates and buy them back at a new “fair market value price”. The Federal Reserve would be ordered by the legislation, if signed into law, to simply send the Treasury the difference between the old price and the new price to the Treasury General Account (TGA) (see Monday’s piece). \n\nSubscribe\n\nHere’s the relevant section of the “BITCOIN Act of 2024” whose purpose is described as “To establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and other programs to ensure the transparent management of Bitcoin holdings of the Federal Government, to offset costs utilizing certain resources of the Federal Reserve System, and for other purposes.”:\n\n(c) Federal reserve system gold certificates.—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal reserve banks shall tender all outstanding gold certificates in their custody to the Secretary. Not later than 90 days after the tender of the last such certificate, the Secretary shall issue new gold certificates to the Federal reserve banks that reflect the fair market value price of the gold held against such certificates by the Treasury, as of the date specified by the Secretary on each new gold certificate. Upon issue by the Secretary, each Federal reserve bank that receives a new gold certificate shall remit the difference in cash value between the old and new gold certificates to the Secretary for deposit in the general fund within 90 days.\n\n(d) Conforming amendment.—Section 5117(b) of title 31, United States Code, is amended by striking “(for the purpose of issuing those certificates, of 42 and two-ninths dollars a fine troy ounce)”.\n\nThat last part is crucial too. Current legislation sets the price that the gold certificates can be issued at (and thus the current “official Federal Government price” of Gold). \n\nThis is returning to the president’s ability to freely set the price of gold that Roosevelt was granted 90 years ago and which we discussed last Friday. Let’s recap this mind bending house of mirrors: this legislation is aimed at resetting the government’s official gold price to “fair market value” so that they can sell 100s of billions of dollars of “gold certificates” they did not have the legal authority to issue before. The purpose of doing this is to take the supposed “proceeds” of writing in an accounting system that the Fed has “purchased” more gold certificates and deposit them into the Treasury’s bank account while scribbling (in COBOL) in another accounting system that the “Bitcoin Purchase program” can now buy billions of dollars worth of bitcoin. If you feel like you’re playing three card monte with a huckster who has you confused about which direction to look, that’s because you are.\n\nAmazingly, this legislation also dips into the Federal Reserve in yet more ways. It does so by reducing the Federal Reserve’s System’s official net worth (its “surplus funds”) and consequently claiming more for the Treasury, to be swept into the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve at the same time it puts a kind of “first lien” on the remittances the Federal Reserve System pays to the Treasury for the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. This “first lien” even applies over and above the Fed’s “deferred asset” which is an accounting gimmick already used by the Federal Reserve to avoid negative income from impacting its official net worth. \n\nSubscribe\n\nThat sounds complicated but what it is is mind-repelling in its simplicity. The Federal Reserve treats its obligation to pay the vast majority of its net income to the Treasury as a liability. So what the Federal Reserve says in its accounting rules is that a Federal Reserve Bank which has negative net income consequently sees its obligation to pay remittances go negative i.e. its a “negative liability”. In other words its obligation to pay net income to the treasury… becomes an asset. Under the Fed’s current approach, this “deferred asset” must be shrunk by net income flows before remittances resume. You can read about the Fed’s internal thinking about “deferred assets” in this 2013 memo declassified in 2020. What the BITCOIN Act of 2024 is saying is “we don’t care about covering the Fed’s past losses, give us our cut first”.\n\nThis legislation is, in spades, what long-time Cato Institute scholar George Selgin calls “The Menace of Fiscal QE”. As George explains at the end of one chapter in this book (based on my feedback to his manuscript), Modern Monetary Theory’s view (and mine) is congress should explicitly use congressional legislation to straightforwardly appropriate money:\n\nTo their credit, Modern Monetary Theorists see little virtue in backdoor spending (or the “political lightening”) of expensive government programs such as the Green New Deal. In an op-ed warning against attempts to mask the “burden of the GND on government balance sheets” by resorting to offbudget financing, Nathan Tankus, Andrés Bernal, and Raúl Carrillo (2019) insist that, if a program is considered “necessary for the collective good . . . Congress should appropriate as much public money as necessary” to pay for it (emphasis added). Thus, the MMT view that the Fed is bound to supply the government with all the money the government needs [directly or indirectly] to fund whatever level of spending it chooses is not itself an argument for having the Fed directly fund particular government programs. \n\nIf this proposal comes close to becoming reality you will hear it referred to as “Doing MMT for Bitcoin”. George Selgin and I disagree on a lot, but I commend him for acknowledging to Cato Institute readers that that would be a false characterization. I will be honest though, it's hard not to read this legislation and feel like the person who wrote it reads Notes on the Crises. To me reading this legislation is like admiring the architecture of a beautiful building that is designed exactly how you’d want to design it if your goal was to collapse it upon its occupants at a precise date in the future. I have grudging respect for the handiwork that went into designing this scam  legislation\n\nWhatever your thoughts about the merits of bitcoin, what is so striking about this proposal-- and its popularity among so many bitcoin supporters-- is that it fully turns the original motivation of Bitcoin on its head. The mysterious creator of bitcoin constantly inveighed against Bank- and State- money creation. For example in a forum post in 2009 “Satoshi Nakamoto” said “Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve”. Now the big thing in bitcoin is mobilizing the government’s power to create money to buy bitcoin and cash out its biggest holders. Bitcoin still promises you nothing but is now getting the same backing of public money that sustains the functioning of our payments system, and ultimately our monetary system. I respect the bitcoin advocates who have the intellectual honesty to be appalled by this (for bigger picture thoughts on bitcoin, you can read this four year old piece)\n\nSubscribe\n\nWill this proposal happen? I do not know but the Fort Knox visit suggests to me they are going to push hard. I can also exclusively update here my original reporting February 3rd. In that piece I relayed explosive information about Treasury secretary Bessent. Information so explosive no one has been able to get two independent sources to conform it and thus no mainstream journalist will even mention I’ve reported it:\n\nHowever, this is consistent with internal conversations among those in the president’s orbit. I can exclusively report here for the first time that Scott Bessent was advised that what Donald Trump wanted in a Treasury Secretary was a person who would have the credibility Steve Mnuchin had with Wall Street but who would be loyal to Trump above all other considerations, according to two sources familiar with the situation. This included, but was not limited to, unconditionally agreeing to work with whomever Trump sent over to the Treasury Department and helping go after Donald Trump’s enemies. In the context of Bessent’s actions this week, and what Elon Musk and DOGE want from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, these commitments take on a dark new meaning.\n\nWhat I can add to what I’ve reported on February 3rd is that my two anonymous sources also communicated to me that one of the other things Bessent was told was a non-negotiable part of going along with being Trump’s Treasury Secretary was fully backing and advocating for the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve idea. \n\nTo be clear, these two anonymous sources can’t confirm to me that the person or persons who told Treasury Secretary Bessent this were speaking on behalf of Donald Trump’s thinking at the time. But they do know that this is the advice Bessent was given in preparation of “auditioning” for the role. I have yet to have reason to doubt that Bessent has been following this advice. Indeed many people believed that Bessent was moving in this direction when he referenced on February 3rd his goal to \"monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet.\" With the Trump-Musk visit to Fort Knox I see this as certainly what they will try to do. Whether they’ll succeed is another question. Sometime in the future, I’ll write about the possible further accounting gimmicks they might pursue in connection with “capital gains” on the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve’s Bitcoin holdings. Have a good day readers; I should be back talking about more Trump-Musk scams on Friday.","html":"<p></p><p><strong>Notes on the Crises pivoted on February 1st into around the clock coverage of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025.

Now that Elon Musk and Donald Trump are set to visit Fort Knox, the famous home of the United States Treasury’s gold stock, it's time to write about it. You might be asking yourself, well wait how do these topics relate? Amazingly, they are intimately and causally connected. Visiting Fort Knox is a <strong>publicity stunt to get Congress to back an accounting gimmick that will fund the Bitcoin reserve</strong>. It is, as the title of this piece says, <strong>A scam built atop an accounting gimmick wrapped in bullshit</strong>. Now let me explain how.</p><p>The stated reason Musk and Trump are visiting Fort Knox is to “make sure the gold is still there”. Trump, for example, <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-and-elon-musk-will-go-to-fort-knox-to-make-sure-no-one-stole-us-gold-how-that-conspiracy-theory-got-started-225218892.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>has said in a speech</u></a> (and really more than one speech) “We're going to open up the doors. I'm going to see we have gold there. We want to find out, did anybody steal the gold in Fort Knox?” This, of course, originated with Musk who has been tweeting about this nonstop. Take, for example, a <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891566355532349445?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>tweet from last week </u></a>where he says “Looking for the gold at Fort Knox …” and includes an image of a meme based on a scene in a South Park episode where a character says “Annnd It’s Gone”.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdejwa1-7xf7uIFBmTY24g-c0QV4xbPwvP6aooLMl3YlItzL-cfIIKcqlImgmKwUG1qZS8ru_dv0OkmbccPXXwJaT7AnajCyTwKbI4iyoER2czdgha_bKLe4QTbM8Ps7dRvxmqMaQ?key=dfuY-t4AyGIwPt6rwFygx4vH\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"478\" height=\"409\"></figure><p>While visiting Fort Knox is likely meant to boost Musk’s twitter by livestreaming the visit on the platform and plays to conspiracy minded Trump supporters who have theories about Fort Knox’s gold, these are not the substantive underlying reasons.

In subsequent research that fall I updated it to an “85 year history” when I came across a fascinating episode during Roosevelt’s administration where he wanted to use a wide array of accounting gimmicks to avoid raising the debt ceiling in 1939- right at the beginning of the modern debt ceiling. That history was so long and sprawling I got pulled away from finishing it and publishing it. I hope to get it done in the next couple of months during a period where things hopefully are a little less hectic in <em>Notes on the Crises.</em> A part of that article is about gold and how in the current organization of our legal system,<strong> the Treasury’s gold holdings are not actually about the gold market at all- they are about intragovernmental accounting</strong>.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Readers of my colleague and friend, economist Stephanie Kelton, will have already gotten a preview of my research in <a href=\"https://stephaniekelton.substack.com/p/the-real-reason-trump-and-musk-are?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>her article on Monday</u></a> on the Trump-Musk Fort Knox visit. Here’s what I wrote on this basic gimmick two years ago in that unpublished manuscript:</p><blockquote>First up, we have the oldest example I will discuss today: “monetizing” gold. The history of the U.S. holdings of gold is long, complex and beyond the scope of this piece. For today’s purposes, the main thing that matters is that the United States government has lots of gold and the Treasury has a handy way of filling up its bank account based on that gold without changing anything at all. Instead of having to actually physically transfer gold, the Treasury can issue “gold certificates” based on its gold holdings. Even better, it doesn’t have to sell those gold certificates on the private market. It can just sell them directly to the Federal Reserve.</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/11/15/issue.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><img src=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/02/New-york-times-gold-cover.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1266\" height=\"998\" srcset=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/New-york-times-gold-cover.jpg 600w, https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/New-york-times-gold-cover.jpg 1000w, https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/02/New-york-times-gold-cover.jpg 1266w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1953/11/15/issue.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Here's the New York Times cover story from 1953</span></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>As the New York Federal Reserve’s longtime “in house” historian <a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/146682/1/862691109.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Kenneth Garbade put it</u></a>: “The action did not affect monetary policy—it merely replaced one asset (the Treasury notes) with another (the gold certificates) on the Fed’s books”. You could replace “gold certificates” with <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/more-foia-memos-the-feds-2013-treasury-default-memo-just-in-time-for-another-round-of-debt-ceiling-politics/\"><u>“platinum coins”</u></a> and nothing would be fundamentally different. What matters is that this is an intragovernmental accounting change which changes nothing of substance for the rest of the economy- except avoiding government default as a result of the debt ceiling.</blockquote><p>The key to understanding this is the Federal Reserve is not going to be selling these gold certificates to the private sector. Nor is it, or anyone else, going to “cash them in” for the gold.&nbsp;</p><p>So if the certificates are just a book entry in some accounting ledger, why does it matter that they are “gold” certificates? Couldn’t you just sell a “avoiding the debt ceiling” certificate which promised redemption in “avoiding-the-debt-ceiling brownie points”? The answer is- yes. The Treasury would just need legal authorization to issue “avoiding the debt ceiling” certificates. This only sounds sillier than gold certificates because it's more honest. <strong>The key to bullshit is it sounds good to the uninitiated</strong> and nothing sounds better to those who don’t know much about finance than gold.</p><p>In this sense, using the legal authority to mint a Trillion Dollar Platinum coin is the opposite of bullshit. Those of us who long advocated using this legal authority to avoid default frankly acknowledge that it's an accounting gimmick and use the opportunity to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/opinion/trillion-dollar-coin.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>educate the public about money, rather than dupe it</u></a>. Just last month I released a 2013 Federal Reserve memo I got through FOIA about what the Fed would do in case of a debt ceiling driven default. In that article I provided a refresher <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/more-foia-memos-the-feds-2013-treasury-default-memo-just-in-time-for-another-round-of-debt-ceiling-politics/\"><u>that linked to myriad pieces</u></a> I’ve written on this topic the past five years, so please check that out if you’re unfamiliar with what I am referencing.</p><p>Which brings us back to the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. This legislation takes advantage of just how good gold sounds to the laymen (emphasis on “men”…) to propose funding the “Bitcoin Purchase Program” with Gold Certificates. Bitcoin acquired in the “Bitcoin Purchase Program” goes into the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve that will <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>involve “cold storage” of bitcoin</u></a>. Yes really. The legislation actually goes further and has the Federal Reserve hand over its existing gold certificates and <strong>buy them back</strong> at a new “fair market value price”. The Federal Reserve would be ordered by the legislation, if signed into law, to simply send the Treasury the difference between the old price and the new price to the Treasury General Account (TGA) (<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/how-can-we-know-if-government-payments-stop-an-exploratory-analysis-of-banking-system-warning-signs/\"><u>see Monday’s piece</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Here’s the relevant section of the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4912/text?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“BITCOIN Act of 2024” whose purpose</u></a> is described as “To establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and other programs to ensure the transparent management of Bitcoin holdings of the Federal Government, <strong>to offset costs utilizing certain resources of the Federal Reserve System</strong>, and for other purposes.”:</p><blockquote>(c) Federal reserve system gold certificates.—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal reserve banks shall tender all outstanding gold certificates in their custody to the Secretary.

As George explains at the end of one chapter in this book (based on my feedback to his manuscript), Modern Monetary Theory’s view (and mine) is congress should explicitly use congressional legislation to straightforwardly appropriate money:</p><blockquote><strong>To their credit, Modern Monetary Theorists see little virtue in backdoor spending (or the “political lightening”) of expensive government programs</strong> such as the Green New Deal. In an op-ed warning against attempts to mask the “burden of the GND on government balance sheets” by resorting to offbudget financing, Nathan Tankus, Andrés Bernal, and Raúl Carrillo (2019) insist that, if a program is considered “necessary for the collective good . . . Congress <em>should appropriate</em> as much public money as necessary” to pay for it (emphasis added). Thus, the MMT view that the Fed is bound to supply the government with all the money the government needs [directly or indirectly] to fund whatever level of spending it chooses<strong> is not itself an argument for having the Fed directly fund particular government programs.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><p>If this proposal comes close to becoming reality you will hear it referred to as “Doing MMT for Bitcoin”. George Selgin and I disagree on a lot, but I commend him for acknowledging to Cato Institute readers that that would be a false characterization. I will be honest though, it's hard not to read this legislation and feel like the person who wrote it reads <strong><em>Notes on the Crises</em></strong>. To me reading this legislation is like admiring the architecture of a beautiful building that is designed exactly how you’d want to design it if your goal was to collapse it upon its occupants at a precise date in the future. I have grudging respect for the handiwork that went into designing this <s>scam</s>&nbsp; legislation</p><p>Whatever your thoughts about<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bitcoin-is-not-a-bubble/\"><u> the merits of bitcoin</u></a>, what is so striking about this proposal-- and its popularity among so many bitcoin supporters-- is that it fully turns the original motivation of Bitcoin on its head. The mysterious creator of bitcoin constantly inveighed against Bank- and State- money creation. For example in a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/money/378108/bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto-peter-todd-money-electric?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>forum post in 2009</u></a> “Satoshi Nakamoto” said “Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve”. Now the big thing in bitcoin is mobilizing the government’s power to create money to buy bitcoin and cash out its biggest holders. Bitcoin still promises you nothing but is now getting the same backing of public money that sustains the functioning of our payments system, and ultimately our monetary system. I respect the bitcoin advocates who have the intellectual honesty to be appalled by this (for bigger picture thoughts on bitcoin, you can read this<u> </u><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bitcoin-is-not-a-bubble/\"><u>four year old piece</u></a>)</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Will this proposal happen? I do not know but the Fort Knox visit suggests to me they are going to push hard. I can also exclusively update here <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>my original reporting February 3rd</u></a>. In that piece I relayed explosive information about Treasury secretary Bessent. Information so explosive no one has been able to get two independent sources to conform it and thus no mainstream journalist will even mention I’ve reported it:</p><blockquote>However, this is consistent with internal conversations among those in the president’s orbit. I can exclusively report here for the first time that Scott Bessent was advised that <strong>what Donald Trump wanted in a Treasury Secretary was a person who would have the credibility Steve Mnuchin had with Wall Street but who would be loyal to Trump above all other considerations, according to two sources familiar with the situation</strong>. This included, but was not limited to, unconditionally agreeing to work with whomever Trump sent over to the Treasury Department and helping go after Donald Trump’s enemies. In the context of Bessent’s actions this week, and what Elon Musk and DOGE want from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, these commitments take on a dark new meaning.</blockquote><p>What I can add to what I’ve reported on February 3rd is <strong>that my two anonymous sources also communicated to me that one of the other things Bessent was told was a non-negotiable part of going along with being Trump’s Treasury Secretary was fully backing and advocating for the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve idea.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>To be clear, these two anonymous sources can’t confirm to me that the person or persons who told Treasury Secretary Bessent this were speaking on behalf of Donald Trump’s thinking at the time. But they do know that this is the advice Bessent was given in preparation of “auditioning” for the role. I have yet to have reason to doubt that Bessent has been following this advice. Indeed many people believed that Bessent was moving in this direction when he referenced on February 3rd his goal to \"monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet.\" With the Trump-Musk visit to Fort Knox I see this as certainly what they will try to do. Whether they’ll succeed is another question. Sometime in the future, I’ll write about the possible further accounting gimmicks they might pursue in connection with “capital gains” on the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve’s Bitcoin holdings.

Obviously if no payments are going out, that will quickly become clear. But even learning 24 hours sooner could be quite significant. Meanwhile it's possible for a quantitatively large amount of impoundment to happen that falls short of the immediate mass crisis. Early warning signs of this eventuality would be especially helpful. Amidst the insanity I’ve made a number of “deep background” phone calls to sources which may be former or current high level employees of the Treasury, Federal Reserve and/or major banks (no, I will not be more specific than that). \n\nOn those phone calls I tried to strategize with my informants regarding every possible angle to understand the possible immediate effects on the banking system and whether there were ways to measure these effects. I only got a chance, between everything else going on, to write up the rough consensus that emerged from those conversations this weekend (it's been a very busy time!)\n\nBefore we get to what these sources told me, it's important to run through some more context. Hopefully recent readers of Notes on the Crises have picked up over the past month that the vast majority of government payments flow through the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s systems. These systems effectively serve as a “payments intermediary” between Federal agencies and the wider economy. I haven’t emphasized how the treasury connects up with the wider payments system but longtime readers will know this part of the story well. Payments run through a Treasury account at the Federal Reserve called the “Treasury General Account” and onto banks who, similar to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, serve as payment intermediaries. In other words, the government sends you a payment by crediting a bank’s account with the Federal Reserve who, in turn, credits your checking account.\n\nThus, outlays from the Treasury’s bank account, known as the “Treasury General Account”, are what we are trying to capture when we try to “observe” a failure of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s payment systems or the scale of impoundment at the “payments” layer. These outlays are, from the point of view of the banking system, inflows (we’ll get back to this point later). The only current serious effort I’m aware of trying to measure outflows from the Treasury’s bank account is the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. To their great credit, they published a tracker based on the “Treasury Daily Statement” (which is exactly what it sounds like) the late afternoon of February 3rd. For reference, My dual pieces in this newsletter and at Rolling Stone went live at 6 AM that day warning of the crisis. Thus, you can watch outlays from the Treasury’s General Account every day, with only a few days lag. I’ve been aware of this work from early on but have been remiss in giving it the attention it deserves in the newsletter.\n\nImportantly, you also can follow specific outlays using their tracker tool. For example, their accessible presentation of the data the Treasury publishes shows USAID outlays drop to zero on January 28th. Thus, for as long as the Treasury Daily Statement remains accurate (and that is a big caveat), one of the best ways of assessing what’s going on is this tracker. Unfortunately, as they emphasize, outlays are not the same thing as appropriations so you can’t determine exactly how much impoundment is happening. However, this can give us the big picture and tell us when they are crushing specific agencies. The nagging question amidst all of this is: what about the integrity of this data? After all, the source of this data is… the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Marko Elez may have been bounced out (and now at the Social Security Administration) but there is very little reason to think this is the end of this over the course of the second Trump administration.\n\nWhich leads to the line of inquiry I pursued with my sources. The perspective I took when discussing this with them from three weeks ago is an opposite, but mirrored angle to the mode of analysis the Hamilton Project took. Instead of examining things from the perspective of what the Treasury daily statements are (or would be if not manipulated), I thought about this in terms of the effect of fluctuations in the Treasury’s general account on the banking system. In other words, the Hamilton Project focused on the outlays from the Treasury’s bank account while I’m focusing on these same flows as inflows into the banking system. \n\nThis is where accounting is key. For every sale there is a purchase. For every outlay there is a receipt. For every net outflow there is a net inflow. Thus the rise or fall in the Treasury’s account must be matched by a fall or rise in some other entity’s account with the Federal Reserve. Alternatively, it may be matched by a rise or a fall in the Federal Reserve’s liabilities themselves. In other words, every liability is someone else’s asset.\n\nRegular readers know that my analytical lens (but not my end-point) is a school of thought called Modern Monetary Theory (known academically as Neochartalism). MMT has, from its inception, emphasized the role of taxation and spending on the level of “settlement balances” in the banking system. Fair warning, this is going to get wonky and in the future I will have to bring back my monetary policy 101 series to fully run through all these details when the most acute phases of the current crisis passes.\n\n“Settlement balance” is a European phrase for funds in accounts at a central bank that I use because I think it's clearer than the alternatives. Another way of saying the same thing is that settlement balances are the “book entry” IOUs that central banks create when making payments. In simpler terms, money. If government budget deficits were purely a matter of the injection of settlement balances they would increase the total amount of balances held by the banking system. From this perspective, modern government issued securities are a monetary policy tool which drain settlement balances from the banking system. \n\nThat the Treasury more or less issues treasury securities to match net payment outflows from the Treasury General Account over time ensures that over long periods of time the Treasury does not increase the overall level of settlement balances in the banking system, allowing the Federal Reserve to control this variable. On the other hand, over the past 20 years or so the Federal Reserve has gained more tools to control the level of settlement balances in the banking system on its own and could be given the authority to issue its own securities. You can read more about this in past articles here, here and here. I especially recommend my 2020 piece “The Federal Government Always Money-Finances Its Spending: A Restatement” which runs through many of the concepts utilized here using “T accounts” which lay out the complete accounting step by step.\n\nSubscribe\n\nThe Federal Reserve's current monetary policy operating procedures are known today as the \"ample reserves\" framework because they aim to provide the banking system with plenty of settlement balances in the hopes that factors that affect the banking system’s need for liquidity over short periods of time will “take care of themselves”. The operating procedures from before the Great Financial Crisis are sometimes called a “scarce reserves” framework but I would prefer to call it a “limited reserves framework” or, better yet, a “limited settlement balances” framework. In the “limited settlement balances” framework the Federal Reserve would use repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements (we’ll get back to what these are in a bit) to modulate the level of settlement balances in the banking system on a daily or intraday basis. \n\nThey did this to adjust the level of settlement balances in the banking system when needed for monetary policy purposes, but more often they did this to account for factors outside of their control changing the level of settlement balances. These factors outside the control of the central bank are known in the central banking literature as “autonomous factors”. When you quantify these factors to look at their overall effect on the level of settlement balances in the banking system they are referred to as “net autonomous factors”. This leads to the accounting identity:\n\n\nSettlement Balances in the Banking System = Net Autonomous Factors + Net Borrowing from the Central Bank + Net Central Bank Purchases  \n\nThis is known as a “stock” measure because it measures the overall level of all these variables at a point in time. Think of the water level of a bathtub. This can be turned into a “flow” measure which measures change over time. Think of the rate at which water flows out of the bathtub’s faucet or the degree to which the water level of the tub has risen. To represent change I will be using the conventional symbol- a delta Δ:\n\n\nΔ Settlement Balances in the Banking System = Δ Net Autonomous Factors + Δ Net Borrowing from the Central Bank + Δ Net Central Bank Purchases\n\nFrom here, it should be clearer why, in a limited settlement balances framework, the central bank’s daily work involves adjusting for factors outside their control.\n\nIf you have a “target” level of settlement balances in the banking system then “net autonomous factors” can move that variable away from its target. You are successful when “Δ Settlement Balances in the Banking System” is zero which means central bank actions have to always be an opposite mirror image of the net autonomous factors. If they inject settlement balances, you have to act to remove them. If they remove settlement balances, you have to act to inject more. There are a few so-called “autonomous factors”, notably orders of physical currency by the banking system. The most important “autonomous factor”, however, is the change in the Treasury’s account (or accounts) at the central bank. Thus in a limited settlement balance framework the biggest daily factor the Federal Reserve adjusted for was volatility in the Treasury’s General Account (TGA). \n\nWhich brings us back to Repurchase agreements. Repurchase agreements are just a fancy way of lending against Treasury securities as collateral. A collateralized loan can be structured as an agreement to buy a security (or other property) while also being issued a promise to buy back that security by the seller at a set price. The difference between the selling price and the repurchase price can implicitly contain an interest rate while the fact that the creditor technically owns the treasury security outright means (under current law) they can just keep it if the other party defaults on the promise to repurchase it. If it were legally, and not merely economically, a collateralized loan they might have to hand the collateral over to a trustee who would sell the collateral and compensate other creditors with a higher priority in bankruptcy. In the lingo of the financial world a “repo” agreement takes the perspective of the lender so if you want to describe the borrower’s perspective you call a repurchase agreement a “reverse repo” agreement.\n\nThe Treasury holds auctions of Treasury securities throughout the month but these auctions only settle at a few regular dates. In the “limited settlement balance” framework of the past that meant entering repurchase agreements to inject settlement balances prior to the auction settlement draining them right back out. Once outlays from the Treasury’s “checking” account injected settlement balances again the Federal Reserve would reduce its “repo” activity with the goal of keeping the banking system’s settlement balances at the “target” level.\n\nSubscribe\n\nThe fact that Treasury auctions only settle at a few specified times over the course of a month means that those auctions are mostly not the cause of the volatility in the Treasury’s “checking” account with the Federal Reserve. To break down what this means in concrete terms, on “auction settlement dates” the Treasury General Account balance goes up a lot and (assuming a typical period of deficit spending) gradually declines over time with erratic jumps up and down because of outlays and revenue inflows erratically changing each day. A crosscutting factor here is payroll and scheduled social security payments- these go out in large amounts at the beginning of each month. Overall though, volatility is kind of the meeting point between these two “scissors”. From the perspective of what we are concerned about here, this also means we can sidestep the question of treasury auctions. \n\nIn my conversations across quite a diverse array of sources, some initial hypotheses have reached general consensus. That is, a sign of large quantities of spending not going out is a fall in the volatility of the Treasury’s general account’s daily balance because volatility comes from both the tax and the spending side and not the treasury issuance and settlement side. Thus the TGA’s overall volatility is the product of the volatility of both these factors and if you take the volatility experienced in the past couple of years as a baseline, major drops in outlays will lead to less volatility. \n\nFurther, since the Federal Reserve is no longer using a “limited settlement balance” framework and instead using an “ample settlement balances” framework, we shouldn’t expect “net autonomous factors” to be adjusted for. Indeed, this is likely an important part of “Repo Madness” in 2019. Before all hell broke loose, I was planning on spending February writing, in part, about “Repo Madness” utilizing the 2019 Federal Open Market Committee transcripts and Federal Reserve memos which has just been released six weeks ago. For now, it's sufficient to state that they are not trying to precisely adjust for “autonomous factors” and their impact on the level of settlement balances in the banking system.  \n\nSubscribe\n\nThe practical consequences of this for keeping a close eye on what is going on with the Treasury’s checking account is that fluctuations in its balance should have a roughly 1 to 1 impact on the banking system under the current monetary policy implementation approach. Thus, if large scale impoundment happens there will be less outflows from the Treasury’s account at the Federal Reserve. This will then lead some proportion of banks to overdraft their accounts over the course of the day, which is referred to as an “intraday overdraft”.  This means that “aggregate” or “total” intraday overdrafts of the banking system as a whole will increase. Many bankers will suddenly need to cover outflows usually covered by inflows of government spending into the banking system. \n\nThis leads to an area where there is some debate among my sources over whether the consistent lack of inflows of government spending would lead to greater hoarding of liquidity in the banking system. The debate revolves around whether the Federal Reserve would have to adjust the way it implements monetary policy to “accommodate” the sudden loss of these regular inflows. The “unconcerned” perspective essentially takes the view that large intraday overdrafts would keep happening but bankers would \"settle up\" on an overnight basis and be able to find the new funding they need without changes in the banking system’s overall liquidity behavior. The “Fed adjustment” view thinks that a game of “hot potato” may emerge as bankers delay outgoing payments they can legally delay in an attempt to hold onto liquidity and this knock on effect leads to “aggregate” liquidity hoarding.\n\nAs someone interested in the nuts and bolts of payments systems and monetary policy implementation I find this “debate” I’ve been serving as a kind of “anonymous clearinghouse” for quite interesting. However, for most readers this debate is irrelevant. My sources all agree that an early sign would be far greater intraday or “daylight” overdrafts across the banking system. Further, we have no public “real time” measurements for this the way we do for the Treasury Daily Statement. Nor is there an “indirect” measure we have a real time measure of.\n\nSubscribe\n\nLet me make my next few statements very carefully. If I have high level current Federal Reserve or Banker sources, I’ve encouraged them to construct measures of the number (and total quantities) of government ACH payments coming by on a daily, weekly etc basis. Whether or not I have such sources, I encourage any readers who fit this description to construct such measures if those measures do not already exist. I also encourage all high level bankers & Federal Reserve employees to pay attention to the total intraday overdrafts being taken by either their bank or by the banking system (in case of a Federal Reserve reader).\n\nGetting a source or sources to report “real time” Federal Reserve measures of daylight overdrafts would be the most helpful and consequently the most unlikely.  Banker sources may be less tight-lipped than Federal Reserve sources and be willing to confidentially inform me if intraday (\"daylight\") overdrafts are regularly rising. Hopefully, however, writing this all publicly will push individuals and institutions across the financial system to take these measures more seriously and maybe that will indirectly get that information out there in more indirect ways.\n\nFinally, the other complication is, of course, if they start messing with things on the tax side. They seem to have backed off of the Internal Revenue Service operationally for now, but if they start messing with tax collection then it will be far more difficult to divine what is happening from fluctuations in the Treasury’s “bank account” volatility. As an aside, I am still looking for more Internal Revenue Service sources, especially those with expertise in how their legacy IT systems work (or their modern data processing systems work for that matter).

Obviously if no payments are going out, that will quickly become clear. But even learning 24 hours sooner could be quite significant. Meanwhile it's possible for a quantitatively large amount of impoundment to happen that falls short of the immediate mass crisis. Early warning signs of this eventuality would be especially helpful. Amidst the insanity I’ve made a number of “deep background” phone calls to sources which may be former or current high level employees of the Treasury, Federal Reserve and/or major banks (no, I will not be more specific than that).&nbsp;</p><p>On those phone calls I tried to strategize with my informants regarding every possible angle to understand the possible immediate effects on the banking system and whether there were ways to measure these effects. I only got a chance, between everything else going on, to write up the rough consensus that emerged from those conversations this weekend (it's been a very busy time!)</p><p>Before we get to what these sources told me, it's important to run through some more context. Hopefully recent readers of <em>Notes on the Crises</em> have picked up <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>over the past month</u></a> that the vast majority of government payments flow through the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s systems. These systems effectively serve as a “payments intermediary” between Federal agencies and the wider economy. I haven’t emphasized how the treasury connects up with the wider payments system but longtime readers will know this part of the story well. Payments run through a Treasury account at the Federal Reserve called the “Treasury General Account” and onto banks who, similar to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, serve as payment intermediaries. In other words, the government sends you a payment by crediting a bank’s account with the Federal Reserve who, in turn, credits your checking account.</p><p>Thus, outlays from the Treasury’s bank account, known as the “Treasury General Account”, are what we are trying to capture when we try to “observe” a failure of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s payment systems or the scale of impoundment at the “payments” layer. These outlays are, from the point of view of the banking system, inflows (we’ll get back to this point later). The only current serious effort I’m aware of trying to measure outflows from the Treasury’s bank account is the <a href=\"https://www.hamiltonproject.org/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution</u></a>. To their great credit, <a href=\"https://www.hamiltonproject.org/data/tracking-federal-expenditures-in-real-time/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>they published a tracker based on the “Treasury Daily Statement”</u></a> (which is exactly what it sounds like) the late afternoon of February 3rd. For reference, My dual pieces <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>in this newsletter</u></a> and at <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-elon-musk-treasury-payment-system-dangerous-1235254831?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Rolling Stone</u></a> went live at 6 AM that day warning of the crisis. Thus, you can watch outlays from the Treasury’s General Account every day, with only a few days lag. I’ve been aware of this work from early on but have been remiss in giving it the attention it deserves in the newsletter.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdPU6B1auyF5f7b8WkP1O64pCGdh8HsOyKSdXq4pYpyFljNRHa8We7oVvNWIWXpqA0bpBsFoRmNkQc79fPymziJIWIPQ0bDrsV2TReFJn5bxYmkVUneiOc7Bj9F-BO-AKBi-PtBnQ?key=hvaIRgVg5YQtw8J7-5Mm-4YU\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"480\" height=\"488\"></figure><p>Importantly, you also can follow <strong>specific</strong> outlays using their tracker tool. For example, their accessible presentation of the data the Treasury publishes shows USAID outlays drop to zero on January 28th. Thus, for as long as the Treasury Daily Statement remains accurate (and that is a big caveat), one of the best ways of assessing what’s going on is this tracker. Unfortunately, as they emphasize, outlays are not the same thing as appropriations so you can’t determine exactly how much impoundment is happening. However, this can give us the big picture and tell us when they are crushing specific agencies. The nagging question amidst all of this is: what about the integrity of this data? After all, the source of this data is… the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Marko Elez may have been bounced out (and now at <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/doge-staffer-behind-racist-posts-reappears-at-social-security?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the Social Security Administration</u></a>) but there is very little reason to think this is the end of this over the course of the second Trump administration.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfSGcb-XqutNQoafQi3vdMAsFcKdLrA87MRBgP0aSUOgXxJBmeILn-QPepsQfaTA7SEgZuDe3CLmO9I1lERwv5iV3g5IdFycqvenVcyp2_5xpXddPEIQ7CBXrICmYeCgBprQ2uPPg?key=hvaIRgVg5YQtw8J7-5Mm-4YU\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"514\" height=\"507\"></figure><p>Which leads to the line of inquiry I pursued with my sources. The perspective I took when discussing this with them from three weeks ago is an opposite, but mirrored angle to the mode of analysis the Hamilton Project took. Instead of examining things from the perspective of what the Treasury daily statements are (or would be if not manipulated), I thought about this in terms of the effect of fluctuations in the Treasury’s general account on the banking system. In other words, the Hamilton Project focused on the outlays from the Treasury’s bank account while I’m focusing on these same flows as<strong> inflows into the banking system</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is where accounting is key. For every sale there is a purchase. For every outlay there is a receipt. For every net outflow there is a net inflow. Thus the rise or fall in the Treasury’s account must be matched by a fall or rise in some other entity’s account with the Federal Reserve. Alternatively, it may be matched by a rise or a fall in the Federal Reserve’s liabilities themselves. In other words, every liability is someone else’s asset.</p><p>Regular readers know that my analytical lens (but not my end-point) is a school of thought called Modern Monetary Theory (known academically as Neochartalism). MMT has, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4227588?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>from its inception</u></a>, emphasized the role of taxation and spending on the level of “settlement balances” in the banking system. Fair warning, this is going to get wonky and in the future I will have to bring back <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-are-banks-special-monetary-policy/\"><u>my monetary policy 101 series</u></a> to fully run through all these details when the most acute phases of the current crisis passes.</p><p>“Settlement balance” is a European phrase for funds in accounts at a central bank that I use because I think it's clearer than the alternatives. Another way of saying the same thing is that settlement balances are the <strong>“book entry” IOUs that central banks create</strong> when making payments. In simpler terms, <strong>money</strong>. If government budget deficits were purely a matter of the injection of settlement balances they would increase the total amount of balances held by the banking system. From this perspective, modern government issued securities are a monetary policy tool which drain settlement balances from the banking system.&nbsp;</p><p>That the Treasury more or less issues treasury securities to match net payment outflows from the Treasury General Account over time ensures that over long periods of time the Treasury does not increase the overall level of settlement balances in the banking system, allowing the Federal Reserve to control this variable. On the other hand, over the past 20 years or so the Federal Reserve has gained more tools to control the level of settlement balances in the banking system on its own and could be given the authority to <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/federal-reserve-issued-securities-not-such-a-crazy-idea-after-all/\"><u>issue its own securities</u></a>. You can read more about this in past articles <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-government-always-money/\"><u>here</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/we-should-authorize-the-federal-reserve/\"><u>here</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/federal-reserve-issued-securities-not-such-a-crazy-idea-after-all/\"><u>here</u></a>. I especially recommend my 2020 piece <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-government-always-money/\"><u>“The Federal Government Always Money-Finances Its Spending: A Restatement”</u></a> which runs through many of the concepts utilized here using “T accounts” which lay out the complete accounting step by step.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>The Federal Reserve's current monetary policy operating procedures are known today as the \"ample reserves\" framework because they aim to provide the banking system with plenty of settlement balances in the hopes that factors that affect the banking system’s need for liquidity over short periods of time will “take care of themselves”. The operating procedures from before the Great Financial Crisis are sometimes called a “scarce reserves” framework but I would prefer to call it a “limited reserves framework” or, better yet, a “limited settlement balances” framework. In the “limited settlement balances” framework the Federal Reserve would use repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements (we’ll get back to what these are in a bit) to modulate the level of settlement balances in the banking system on a daily or intraday basis.&nbsp;</p><p>They did this to adjust the level of settlement balances in the banking system when needed for monetary policy purposes, but more often they did this to account for factors outside of their control changing the level of settlement balances. These factors outside the control of the central bank are known in the central banking literature as “autonomous factors”. When you quantify these factors to look at their overall effect on the level of settlement balances in the banking system they are referred to as “net autonomous factors”. This leads to the accounting identity:</p><h1 id=\"settlement-balances-in-the-banking-system-net-autonomous-factors-net-borrowing-from-the-central-bank-net-central-bank-purchases\"><strong>Settlement Balances in the Banking System = Net Autonomous Factors + Net Borrowing from the Central Bank + Net Central Bank Purchases&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>This is known as a “stock” measure because it measures the overall level of all these variables at a point in time. Think of the water level of a bathtub. This can be turned into a “flow” measure which measures <strong>change</strong> over time. Think of the rate at which water flows out of the bathtub’s faucet or the degree to which the water level of the tub has risen. To represent change I will be using the conventional symbol- a delta Δ:</p><h1 id=\"%CE%B4-settlement-balances-in-the-banking-system-%CE%B4-net-autonomous-factors-%CE%B4-net-borrowing-from-the-central-bank-%CE%B4-net-central-bank-purchases\"><strong>Δ Settlement Balances in the Banking System = Δ Net Autonomous Factors + Δ Net Borrowing from the Central Bank + Δ Net Central Bank Purchases</strong></h1><p>From here, it should be clearer why, in a limited settlement balances framework, the central bank’s daily work involves adjusting for factors outside their control.</p><p>If you have a “target” level of settlement balances in the banking system then “net autonomous factors” can move that variable away from its target. You are successful when “Δ Settlement Balances in the Banking System” is zero which means central bank actions have to always be an opposite mirror image of the net autonomous factors. If they inject settlement balances, you have to act to remove them. If they remove settlement balances, you have to act to inject more. There are a few so-called “autonomous factors”, notably orders of physical currency by the banking system. The most important “autonomous factor”, however, is the change in the Treasury’s account (or accounts) at the central bank. Thus in a limited settlement balance framework the biggest daily factor the Federal Reserve adjusted for was volatility in the Treasury’s General Account (TGA).&nbsp;</p><p>Which brings us back to Repurchase agreements. Repurchase agreements are just a fancy way of lending against Treasury securities as collateral. A collateralized loan can be structured as an agreement to buy a security (or other property) while also being issued a promise to buy back that security by the seller at a set price. The difference between the selling price and the repurchase price can implicitly contain an interest rate while the fact that the creditor technically owns the treasury security outright means (under current law) they can just keep it if the other party defaults on the promise to repurchase it. If it were legally, and not merely economically, a collateralized loan they might have to hand the collateral over to a trustee who would sell the collateral and compensate other creditors with a higher priority in bankruptcy. In the lingo of the financial world a “repo” agreement takes the perspective of the lender so if you want to describe the borrower’s perspective you call a repurchase agreement a “reverse repo” agreement.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/02/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"628\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-1.png 600w, https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/02/image-1.png 628w\"></figure><p>The Treasury holds auctions of Treasury securities throughout the month but these auctions only <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/221/Tentative-Auction-Schedule.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>settle at a few regular dates</u></a>. In the “limited settlement balance” framework of the past that meant entering repurchase agreements to inject settlement balances prior to the auction settlement draining them right back out. Once outlays from the Treasury’s “checking” account injected settlement balances again the Federal Reserve would reduce its “repo” activity with the goal of keeping the banking system’s settlement balances at the “target” level.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>The fact that Treasury auctions only settle at a few specified times over the course of a month means that those auctions are mostly not the cause of the volatility in the Treasury’s “checking” account with the Federal Reserve. To break down what this means in concrete terms, on “auction settlement dates” the Treasury General Account balance goes up a lot and (assuming a typical period of deficit spending) gradually declines over time with erratic jumps up and down because of outlays and revenue inflows erratically changing each day. A crosscutting factor here is payroll and scheduled social security payments- these go out in large amounts at the beginning of each month. Overall though, volatility is kind of the meeting point between these two “scissors”. From the perspective of what we are concerned about here, this also means we can sidestep the question of treasury auctions.&nbsp;</p><p>In my conversations across quite a diverse array of sources, some initial hypotheses have reached general consensus. That is, a sign of large quantities of spending not going out is a <strong>fall</strong> in the volatility of the Treasury’s general account’s daily balance because volatility comes from both the tax and the spending side and not the treasury issuance and settlement side. Thus the TGA’s overall volatility is the product of the volatility of both these factors and if you take the volatility experienced in the past couple of years as a baseline, major drops in outlays will lead to less volatility.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, since the Federal Reserve is no longer using a “limited settlement balance” framework and instead using an “ample settlement balances” framework, we shouldn’t expect “net autonomous factors” to be adjusted for. Indeed, this is likely an important part of <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/looking-back-at-repo-madness-one/\"><u>“Repo Madness” in 2019</u></a>. Before all hell broke loose, I was planning on spending February writing, in part, about “Repo Madness” utilizing the 2019 Federal Open Market Committee transcripts and Federal Reserve memos which has just been released six weeks ago. For now, it's sufficient to state that they are not trying to precisely adjust for “autonomous factors” and their impact on the level of settlement balances in the banking system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>The practical consequences of this for keeping a close eye on what is going on with the Treasury’s checking account is that fluctuations in its balance should have a roughly 1 to 1 impact on the banking system under the current monetary policy implementation approach. Thus, if large scale impoundment happens there will be less outflows from the Treasury’s account at the Federal Reserve. This will then lead some proportion of banks to overdraft their accounts over the course of the day, which is referred to as an “intraday overdraft”.&nbsp; This means that “aggregate” or “total” intraday overdrafts of the banking system as a whole will increase. Many bankers will suddenly need to cover outflows usually covered by inflows of government spending into the banking system.&nbsp;</p><p>This leads to an area where there is some debate among my sources over whether the consistent lack of inflows of government spending would lead to greater hoarding of liquidity in the banking system. The debate revolves around whether the Federal Reserve would have to adjust the way it implements monetary policy to “accommodate” the sudden loss of these regular inflows. The “unconcerned” perspective essentially takes the view that large intraday overdrafts would keep happening but bankers would \"settle up\" on an overnight basis and be able to find the new funding they need without changes in the banking system’s overall liquidity behavior. The “Fed adjustment” view thinks that a game of “hot potato” may emerge as bankers delay outgoing payments they can legally delay in an attempt to hold onto liquidity and this knock on effect leads to “aggregate” liquidity hoarding.</p><p>As someone interested in the nuts and bolts of payments systems and monetary policy implementation I find this “debate” I’ve been serving as a kind of “anonymous clearinghouse” for quite interesting. However, for most readers this debate is irrelevant. My sources all agree that an early sign would be far greater intraday or “daylight” overdrafts across the banking system. Further, we have no public “real time” measurements for this the way we do for the Treasury Daily Statement. Nor is there an “indirect” measure we have a real time measure of.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Let me make my next few statements very carefully. <strong>If </strong>I have high level current Federal Reserve or Banker sources, I’ve <strong>encouraged them to construct measures of the number (and total quantities) of government ACH payments coming </strong>by on a daily, weekly etc basis. Whether or not I have such sources,<strong> I encourage any readers who fit this description to construct such measures</strong> if those measures do not already exist. I also <strong>encourage all high level bankers &amp; Federal Reserve employees to pay attention to the total intraday overdrafts being taken</strong> by either their bank or by the banking system (in case of a Federal Reserve reader).</p><p>Getting a source or sources to report “real time” Federal Reserve measures of daylight overdrafts would be the most helpful and consequently the most unlikely.&nbsp; <strong>Banker sources may be less tight-lipped than Federal Reserve sources and be willing to confidentially inform me if intraday (\"daylight\") overdrafts are regularly rising</strong>. Hopefully, however, writing this all publicly will push individuals and institutions across the financial system to take these measures more seriously and maybe that will indirectly get that information out there in more indirect ways.</p><p>Finally, the other complication is, of course, if they start messing with things on the tax side. They seem to have backed off of the Internal Revenue Service operationally for now, but if they start messing with tax collection then it will be far more difficult to divine what is happening from fluctuations in the Treasury’s “bank account” volatility.

Here's my address: bc1qegxarzsfga9ycesfa7wm77sqmuqqv7083c6ss6\n\nSubscribe\n\nFor almost three weeks I’ve spent an enormous amount of time on the details of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, DOGE’s incursion into it and the manifold dangers it poses. Today I want to step back and reemphasize the bigger picture that I started with exactly three weeks ago in my January 31st piece “Everything About the Trump Administration’s Impoundment Putsch You Were Too Afraid to Ask”. It's imminently understandable that after reading nearly 25,000 words- god is that really how many words it’s been?- many readers do not feel like they have, or have retained, a focus on the big picture. I also haven’t particularly emphasized why exactly these particular unconstitutional actions, or even unconstitutional actions in general, are undesirable or dangerous. To some, this is all painfully obvious. To others, it’s much less so.\n\nCounterintuitively, I am going to start by arguing that an action being unconstitutional does not necessarily make it bad, or undesirable. Take, for example, the Federal Government’s repudiation of the “gold clauses” in treasury securities under the Roosevelt Administration. This meant that bondholders would be paid in dollars in the “face value” amounts listed on the bond for both principal and interest despite the fact that there were so called “gold clauses” requiring the equivalent in gold. This mattered because Roosevelt, when he got into office, increased the official dollar price of gold to 35 dollars an ounce.  The Supreme Court’s decision over this issue in the case Perry v. United States just happened to have passed its 90th anniversary on Tuesday. It is not very well known that this itself was a constitutional crisis. \n\nIn the five weeks between the beginning of oral arguments in Perry v. United States and the court’s decision, President Roosevelt decided that regardless of the outcome he would stick to abrogating the gold clauses. Just three days after oral arguments concluded, President Roosevelt told Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, according to his diary:\n\nThe President argued with me that he wanted me to keep things on an unsettled basis until the Supreme Court handed down its decision. He said that he wanted this for judicial and political reasons. He said the only way that the man in a taxicab can become interested in the gold case is if we kept the story on the front page. He said I want bonds to move up and down and Foreign Exchange. He said if we keep things in a constant turmoil if the case should go against us the man on the street will say for God's sake, Mr. President, do something about it and, he said, if I do everybody in the country will heave a sigh of relief and say thank God [Emphasis added, page 110 electronic pagination]\n\nMorgenthau pushed back strongly against using induced financial instability to pressure the Supreme Court and the President decided to follow Morgenthau’s advice. Nevertheless, the fact that President Roosevelt considered this strategy seriously is itself a sign of the constitutional stakes. \n\nHe even had a speech prepared in case the supreme court ruled against him that would boldly proclaim his intention to ignore the Supreme Court and to seek additional congressional legislation. Looking at Treasury Secretary Morgenthau’s diary once again we find this remarkable description of Roosevelt reading the speech to him over dinner on February 13th 1935: \n\nHe was like a kid about it, he was so pleased with himself and with the statement. After finishing the statement he said, \"Joe Kennedy thinks that the statement is so strong that they will burn the Supreme Court in effigy.\" [Emphasis added, page 68 electronic pagination]\n\nThe entire speech is worth reading. \n\nSubscribe\n\nRoosevelt’s aggressiveness regarding this issue behind closed doors can’t help but raise one’s eyebrows. Nevertheless, on the substance I think Roosevelt was right to be so insistent about the issue. There is no good reason to let treasury holders get 169% on the dollar simply because the United States decided to raise the price of gold and it is easy to foresee a myriad of negative consequences emanating from this. The implications of not abrogating the gold clauses would have been far more serious in the case of private contract or, more precisely, non-federal government contract and Roosevelt was right to fear mass bankruptcy if the latter’s constitutionality was not held up in the case ultimately known as Norman v. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co. \n\nThis may seem to be a largely irrelevant detour to many readers. but it is not. It's important to emphasize that unconstitutionality is not ipso facto bad. Furthermore, while this incident did involve the flexing of executive power and ultimately the Supreme Court avoided ruling against the executive branch to avoid a constitutional confrontation they would likely lose, it was not actually claiming ongoing power on behalf of the executive. The issue was circumstantial- you only need to abrogate gold clauses once. Furthermore, even in Roosevelt’s draft speech he planned to seek legislative approval. The odd branch out was a notably reactionary supreme court (although in this case justices known as sympathetic to the New Deal found themselves repulsed). Judicial review is not an absolute value in my view but a highly imperfect check on the bona fide violation of rights and centralized, unaccountable power. \n\nJudicial authority can of course, itself be centralizing and unaccountable power which violate rights individuals should otherwise have. Today we again find a reactionary supreme court limiting not just executive but even legislative power. Our recent circumstances are far more serious in fact because it is not a stodgy supreme court holding to long standing positions but instead a newly radicalized Supreme Court inventing doctrines that seem to be- and are- expressly designed to abrogate executive actions that they dislike and limit congress’s legislative power. Take, for example, the invented “Major Questions Doctrine” which was explicitly embraced in the 2022 decision West Virginia v. EPA. \n\nIn this case striking down the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions under the Clean Air Act, Chief Justice John Roberts explicitly says:\n\n[I]n certain extraordinary cases, both separation of powers principles and a practical understanding of legislative intent make us \"reluctant to read into ambiguous statutory text\" the delegation claimed to be lurking there. Utility Air, 573 U. S., at 324. To convince us otherwise, something more than a merely plausible textual basis for the agency action is necessary. The agency instead must point to \"clear congressional authorization\" for the power it claims.\n\nWhile this may seem superficially reasonable, what it means in practice is that courts can reject any administrative agency action they dislike and overrule any delegation of discretion to administrative agencies by congress that they deem too sweeping. There is a reason that people like Vivek Ramaswamy- the very short-lived co-head of DOGE- speak openly of taking the opportunity the Major Questions Doctrine provides to “shut down that administrative state” and opines that the “constitutional republic” created by the founding fathers has “has three branches of government, not four\".\n\nSubscribe\n\nRecognizing that the current impoundment crisis comes from the same right wing think tanks which built the modern right wing legal movement and successfully led the Supreme Court to embrace their agenda, we can see better how this all fits together. Impoundment is meant to be the final demolition of the administrative state that the Supreme Court has been building up to. Before their job was to weaken it themselves. Now the Supreme Court’s job is to avoid confronting the constitutional crisis before us and let executive power take the reins, permanently demoting the previously co-equal branches. Expanding the President’s executive power, embracing unitary executive theory, striking down laws passed by congress: it was all in service of eliminating administrative agencies, especially “independent” administrative agencies and shrinking Congress’s ability to govern (even if, at times, it was in the name of Congress governing more). Now the baton has been passed in service of limiting the rights of individuals, especially minorities and greatly enhancing centralized, unaccountable power. \n\nWhich brings us back to 1935. This time in the Supreme Court case Humphrey's Executor v. United States where President Roosevelt fired an Federal Trade Commission’s commissioner for being out of step with the New Deal. The Supreme Court ruled that executive officers, whose scope for removal is determined by congressional statute, could not be removed by the president for reasons other than the statutorily provided ones. I think statutorily created administrative agencies are important and think president Roosevelt overstepped here. Independent agencies- most notably the Federal Reserve Board- can be a problem but overall it is good that we have differentiated locus of authority and some of them are insulated from day to day partisan politics.  It should be no surprise that the Trump administration has explicitly stated its desire to overturn this case and on Tuesday issued an executive order called “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies”. The fact sheet’s title is even more direct: “President Donald J. Trump Reins in Independent Agencies to Restore a Government that Answers to the American People”\n\nWhich brings us to the answer to the question posted by the title of this piece. We should care about the unconstitutionality of the Trump administration’s, and Elon Musk’s DOGE, because it is furthering the centralization and expansion of unaccountable power in the service of abrogating more of our rights. Our right to clean air and water. Our right to the already too-limited protections against discrimination. Our already too-weak right to privacy. Our right not to be scammed and looted from. Our workplace protections and our right not to die from the mishandling of the nuclear stockpile because of inept, dangerous and illegal mass firings. Our already weak right to an education. Most of all, our right to rebuild after the second Trump administration has smashed up so many of the tools of rebuilding. Ultimately, our right to make decisions about our own lives without being essentially micromanaged by venal billionaires. Hell, our right to have a truly different government after “King Trump”.","html":"<p><strong>Notes on the Crises pivoted on February 1st into around the clock coverage of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025.

There is a reason that people like Vivek Ramaswamy- the very short-lived co-head of DOGE- <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/multimedia/events/reining-administrative-state-conversation-vivek-ramaswamy?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>speak openly of taking the opportunity</u></a> the Major Questions Doctrine provides to “shut down that administrative state” and opines that the “constitutional republic” created by the founding fathers has “has three branches of government, not four\".</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Recognizing that the current impoundment crisis comes from the same right wing think tanks which built the modern right wing legal movement and successfully led the Supreme Court to embrace their agenda, we can see better how this all fits together. Impoundment is meant to be the final demolition of the administrative state that the Supreme Court has been building up to. Before their job was to weaken it themselves. Now the Supreme Court’s job is to avoid confronting the constitutional crisis before us and let executive power take the reins, permanently demoting the previously co-equal branches. Expanding the President’s executive power, embracing unitary executive theory, striking down laws passed by congress: it was all in service of eliminating administrative agencies, especially “independent” administrative agencies and shrinking Congress’s ability to govern (even if, at times, it was in the name of Congress governing more). Now the baton has been passed in service of limiting the rights of individuals, especially minorities and greatly enhancing centralized, unaccountable power.&nbsp;</p><p>Which brings us back to 1935. This time in the Supreme Court case <em>Humphrey's Executor v. United States</em> where President Roosevelt fired an Federal Trade Commission’s commissioner for being out of step with the New Deal. The Supreme Court ruled that executive officers, whose scope for removal is determined by congressional statute, could not be removed by the president for reasons other than the statutorily provided ones. I think statutorily created administrative agencies are important and think president Roosevelt overstepped here. Independent agencies- most notably the Federal Reserve Board- can be a problem but overall it is good that we have differentiated locus of authority and some of them are insulated from day to day partisan politics.&nbsp; It should be no surprise that the Trump administration has explicitly stated its desire to overturn this case and on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>issued an executive order</u></a> called “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies”.

We should care about the unconstitutionality of the Trump administration’s, and Elon Musk’s DOGE, because it is furthering the centralization and expansion of unaccountable power in the service of abrogating more of our rights. Our right to clean air and water. Our right to the already too-limited protections against discrimination. Our already too-weak right to privacy. Our right not to be scammed and looted from.

So far, nowhere near enough rich people are paying their fair share.\n\nNote to Readers: I am on bluesky, an alternative to twitter. It's been hard to let go of twitter since that is where I built my following, but clearly it's becoming less usable and there are obvious concerns about getting traction about a Musk story on the Everything Musk app. I have also started an instagram for Notes on the Crises which is currently being populated with my articles.

Here's my address: bc1qegxarzsfga9ycesfa7wm77sqmuqqv7083c6ss6\n\nHello readers, this isn’t going to be a full piece today. This is more or less staking out my desire for sources about the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThe context is that the early reporting on the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025 had concerning signs of what was to come.  Specifically, I’ve been keeping in the back of my mind this tidbit from the New York Times January 31st reporting:\n\nMr. Akis has made similar inquiries at the I.R.S. about its information technology as part of an effort to automate tax collection, according to people familiar with the matter\n\nThus I was concerned from the beginning that they were also targeting IRS systems. However, I already had so much to do with the Bureau of the Fiscal Service and found that more immediately and desperately concerning that I didn’t feel either prepared or capable to also take on this issue. \n\nNow however, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service issues still remain a grave, large and constitutional concern but developments have slowed down somewhat. Meanwhile DOGE’s interest in the IRS has gone from a tangential mention that could be seen at the very periphery of mainstream reporting to a major focus of current reporting. Specifically Jacob Bogage and Jeff Stein in the Washington Post published an article on Monday headlined “Musk’s DOGE seeks access to personal taxpayer data, raising alarm at IRS”.\n\nThe article states:\n\nUnder pressure from the White House, the IRS is considering a memorandum of understanding that would give officials from DOGE — which stands for Department of Government Efficiency — broad access to tax-agency systems, property and datasets. Among them is the Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS, which enables tax agency employees to access IRS accounts — including personal identification numbers — and bank information. It also lets them enter and adjust transaction data and automatically generate notices, collection documents and other records  \n\nSo here we are again. For those who read the early reporting about the Bureau of the Fiscal Service this will all be eerily familiar. This time the “David Lebryk” is IRS Commissioner Doug O’Donnell though it remains to be seen if he’ll resign. Social Security Commissioner Michelle King has already “Lebryked” and resigned in protest of DOGE’s desire to access Social Security data. The story at IRS in broad details is following all the same patterns of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, and really what we are seeing across the Federal Government. From the Washington Post reporting:\n\n“But it’s highly unusual to grant political appointees access to personal taxpayer data, or even programs adjacent to that data, experts say. IRS commissioners traditionally do not have IDRS access. The same goes for the national taxpayer advocate, the agency’s internal consumer watchdog, according to Nina Olson, who served in the role from 2001 to 2019.”\n\nSo here we are. It will shock nobody that there is already a lawsuit challenging DOGE access to the IRS.\n\nSo that’s the state of play. I want to have more to say about this, but to do so I need sources. IRS systems are something I know a lot less about than the Bureau of the Fiscal Service systems and at first glance, the IRS systems seem far more complicated. It's also not clear to me at this stage how much of that complexity is driven by the IRS’s even more extreme budgetary starvation which has inhibited it going through IT modernization, even the extent of IT modernization the Bureau of the Fiscal Service has experienced. There are also good reasons to believe that the complexity is driven by the fact that taxation is far more complex and has much more involved and dense “business logic” than even BFS systems.\n\nIn short, I need to know more about the Internal Revenue Service to feel comfortable doing the kind of dense reporting I’ve done for the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.

As always: if you want to back my work, take out a paid subscription, or pester your institution to do so. Thanks!\n\nTraditionally I’ve kept myself out of Notes on the Crises as much as possible. I worried that having more of my personality and my background would alienate the largely financial sector paid subscriber base I inherited from 2020. I was best known on “Econ twitter” and “Finance twitter” and my prominent support, most notably from Joe Weisenthal of Bloomberg, led to greatest success in those worlds. This was reinforced after I “crashed” after an absurd run of articles: I published a piece every other day on average (including weekends) between March 19th 2020 and July 2nd 2020 (when the Bloomberg Businessweek profile on me came out). Having already had such an intense experience, I am much more prepared for this moment than a lot of other people would be. I know how to pace myself more when doing full time coverage of an intense crisis, and I have a lot more support around me to make doing this possible. (Thanks once more to all my regular readers, especially those who’ve been there since the first Crisis we covered!)\n\nMy audience has now shifted radically, especially my “paid subscription” audience. This new audience, who first became aware of me because of my coverage of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025, is much more balanced gender wise. This new audience is clearly more interested in my (informed) political views. Its only been a couple weeks, but those of you who fit this description have also overwhelmingly demonstrated a very high degree of interest in and appreciation of me as a person. \n\nMeanwhile, given what I just showed was in my reservoir of capabilities, I think the “financial world” can hang around for analysis clearly very few other people are doing, or are capable of. In that context, this older readership, which I very much still appreciate, can “tolerate” greater elements of my personality. Is there really a choice to be made between Nathan Tankus the economic policy expert, and well…me? I don’t think so. If the most powerful people in the world can read past my political commentary for my analysis and investigative reporting, then mid-level financial professionals can too.\n\nSo periodically on weekends, I’ll be introducing more about myself.\n\nWhere I’m going to start is something dear to my family’s heart: my Aunt Frieda Tankus. There were many special things about Frieda, not least of which was that she attended a very special summer camp: Camp Jened. Camp Jened was devoted to disabled children and over time increasingly devoted to their freedom, and ability to express themselves. Frieda was of a key generation of disabled people to come to political consciousness there. It is widely argued today that the modern disability rights movement began at Camp Jened, with the “mother” of the disability rights movement being Judy Heumann. Judy Heumann was my Aunt Frieda Tankus’s childhood best friend. (You may know the story of Camp Jened and Judy Heumann from the Netflix documentary Crip Camp. I highly recommend watching it) \n\nMy father and I attended the February 5th 2020 premiere of Crip Camp at the Museum of Modern Art, which is the last time we saw Judy Heumann alive. It was terrible waiting so many hours for a news outlet to confirm the social media rumors of Judy Heumann’s death the day of March 4th, 2023. It was unbearable having to be the one to break the news to my father that she had died. My father and I rushed to D.C. to attend her funeral on Wednesday March 8th 2023. I took the train back from DC Thursday March 9th, where I caught up with the ongoing strain (and eventual failure) of Silicon Valley Bank, and prepared to rush out four pieces in a week. I capped off March 2023 with a piece about well known financial system expert Zoltan Poszar, and the irony of his inability to commentate on that moment. But that’s a story for another time.\n\n \n\nMy father Morton Tankus wrote a tribute in 2022 to Frieda for the anniversary of her death on July 11th. Before providing more of my own commentary, I’m going to let my dad speak for himself: \n\nJuly 11th marked 50 years since my precious sister Frieda Henia Tankus passed away. I am going to take this occasion to pay tribute to her. She was a remarkable and sweet person, a wonderful sister and a pioneer. I shared 18 of her obscenely short 22 years of her life. We also shared a birthday - March 19th. Six weeks after my parents and sister came to America, I was her fourth birthday present. Frieda was born with Muscular Dystrophy. Her muscles grew increasingly weaker. She walked (very slowly) until she was about 12 years old when she became wheelchair bound. \n\nFrieda was so sweet and caring that everyone considered her their best friend. People also remarked how Frieda and I had an especially close sibling relationship. She would keep in touch with friends by phone and letters. She would have thrived in the internet world. \n\nFrieda was very bright and curious. Her subpar education in the disabled unit of P.S. 219 did not stop her. Frieda was a pioneer and a fighter. She pushed to attend Canarsie High School when they had a policy to exclude disabled students. She won that battle. \n\nFrieda went to NYU with a major in psychology. She fought to live in the dorm, Weinstein Hall when they had a policy to exclude students in wheelchairs. She won that battle and she was the first. \n\nFrieda attended summer camps to share fun and conversation and ideas with her friends who were also disabled. First Camp Oakhurst and then Camp Jened. Frieda's best friend was Judy Heumann whom she met at P.S. 219. Judy had to fight to get a teaching position in the NYC school system after getting her license. Again they wanted to keep her from teaching because she was in a wheelchair. She won that battle. After that triumph Judy and Frieda and several disabled friends Denise Sherer, Bobbi Lynn, Denise McQuade and others formed a disabled rights organization in 1970.\n\nDisabled in Action is still an active organization 52 years later. Judy Heumann was the first president and Frieda was the first vice president. I wish she would have been able to see the fruits of their vision, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nI was on a cross country trip when I called home and they told me she was \"not feeling well\" I was 90% sure she was gone. I flew home from Denver Colorado and when I came home and it was confirmed, it was the worst day of my life. I miss my sweet and wonderful sister everyday.\n\n\n\nThere is frustratingly little of Frieda’s words which have survived. We have a collection of her papers at our house which we are very overdue for depositing at an archive. (As you can imagine, my academic inclination is what makes me harp on such things). The secondary academic literature is also filled with the false claim that she attended Brooklyn College, and started a campus group SOFEDUP. As my dad stated above, she attended NYU and won the fight to be the first wheelchair user to be allowed to live in an NYU dorm. (If you are a disability history researcher who would like to write about Frieda and correct the record, please get into contact.)\n\nI’m an obsessive researcher so if there is anything on the internet in English, I’ll find it. In some digitized papers deposited at UC Berkeley’s Bancroft Library I found a fragment of an article co-written by Frieda Tankus with a “John Martin”, for the camp newsletter the “Jened Jester”. It reads as follows:\n\n[...] at least spiritually and need not concern themselves solely with the physical man. Surely, there are physical differences at Jened -- but they are recognized as only \"differences” and not as insurmountable barriers. For all men have wills and intellects and spirits of their own which, although housed in the body, are free of that body's limitation.\n\n In that \"outside world\" physical differences are noted and invite a range of reactions including pity and scorn. At Jened none deny the reality of physical differences -- they are, however, put in a proper perspective. Once again, however, each of us must look forward to our return to the \"outside world\" where these differences become magnified and distorted by the prejudices of men. \n\nIn the meantime, we enjoy an escape from reality or, perhaps, an escape to reality. Let us agree that man \"lives not by bread alone\"; let us also, then, agree that Jened is an attempt at putting \"bread\" in its place. [emphasis added]\n\nThose of you familiar with the “social model” of disability will recognize this as a remarkable prefiguration of such ideas. To me it’s especially remarkable because it was written by a 16 year old, and her similarly aged coauthor.\n\nFrieda tragically died at the age of 22. Yet she already had a legacy to leave behind. Some people live their whole lives and don’t leave as much of an impact  as she did. Frieda’s political contribution was also not a result of coming from a powerful family, or because she had access to a tremendous amount of resources. After all, she grew up in the projects of East New York. Instead, her legacy was built on friends, community, intelligence and tenacity. I’ve known about Disabled In Action (DIA) and Frieda’s role in it from a very young age. Her story, and many other stories I heard growing up, is what left me with the overwhelming impression that: \n\n1) You don’t have to be special to help change things \n\n2) A lot of the time if you don’t act, there is no one else to act in your place. \n\nClearly these are things I’ve carried with me and played a role in my instinct on January 31st, when I read the Washington Post, that I both could act, had to act and the full knowledge that what I didn’t do could easily be left undone. Rest in Peace Frieda Tankus.","html":"<p><em>This is an “Off Topic” piece of Notes on the Crises.

It's been hard to let go of twitter since that is where I built my following, but clearly it's becoming less usable and there are obvious concerns about getting traction about a Musk story on the Everything Musk app. I have also started an instagram for Notes on the Crises which is currently being populated with my articles. Audio versions of my articles (read by me personally) will come soon\n\nFinally, I'm known as a crypto skeptic, and I am, but that doesn't mean I won't accept people giving away bitcoin to me. Here's my address: bc1qegxarzsfga9ycesfa7wm77sqmuqqv7083c6ss6\n\nFor readers just joining us, for the past two weeks I’ve been covering in depth the Bureau of the Fiscal Service because of the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency’s attack on its professionalism, it’s protection of the privacy of all Americans and their desire to use the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to enforce unconstitutional executive orders demanding impoundment. Much of my writing has been directed at closely monitoring the activities of DOGE employee Marko Elez at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service using current sources among current Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees until his sudden resignation. \n\nI’ve also been covering the various court cases which have been launched against the Trump administration and the Treasury over the Treasury payments systems. The system meltdown and privacy concerns have become less dramatic than they were last week but the constitutional crisis we were already in has only intensified at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. In my last piece I went deep into the sworn testimony of current U.S. Treasury officials to understand what’s been going on. \n\nWhat they revealed is that soon-to-be Fiscal Assistant Secretary and Musk “ally”  Tom Krause is openly talking about using the payment system to pursue “impoundment”. He is pursuing this by rhetorically defining payments that would contravene the Trump administration’s unconstitutional executive orders as “improper”. These “affirmations” also reveal that payment level impoundment has gotten quite far, including sending payment files from one agency for review by another. Since when does the State Department have oversight authority over Health and Human Services’s appropriations? \n\nAfter my piece on Wednesday I became interested in examining what is referred to as the “Do-Not-Pay” system more deeply. This is for a few reasons. First, Musk is clearly quite fixated on it (a point we’ll return to) and unfortunately technical policy debates now are deeply impacted by the … unsteady commentary from Elon Musk and his twitter account. Second, the affirmations I discussed in my last piece illustrated that the impoundment process DOGE and the Trump administration has been envisioning is conceived by DOGE as operationally resembling the Do-Not-Pay system even if their legal purposes are the opposite of each other. For one thing, one is meant to align spending with the constitutional requirement to follow congressional appropriations and the other is an unconstitutional seizure of Congress’s power of the purse.\n\nIn my view, this means getting a better understanding of “Do-Not-Pay” is key to understanding the future of what we might call “Payment System Level” impoundment rather than “Administrative Agency Level” impoundment.\n\nSubscribe\n\nI also wanted to give an indirect opportunity for former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees to respond to things Elon Musk has been saying. The richest man in the world has been attacking the work of diligent public servants who can’t speak up in public either because of fear of losing their jobs or simply being targeted by Musk and/or the Trump administration (in the case of former BFS employees). I have enormous respect for these people and it is painful to get to know them in the context of these erratic, vague and confused attacks on their underfunded and critical work. Some of what former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees have to say will appear in this piece in the form of anonymous quotes while other information will be represented by my own words but reflect “on background” sources. Further, when using names for an example on the record I told all my sources to use the name “Jane Doe”.\n\nBut first, time to read one (very long) Elon Musk tweet from February 8th, 2:51 PM:\n\nTo be clear, what the @DOGE  team and @USTreasury have jointly agreed makes sense is the following:\n\n- Require that all outgoing government payments have a payment categorization code, which is necessary in order to pass financial audits. This is frequently left blank, making audits almost impossible.\n\n- All payments must also include a rationale for the payment in the comment field, which is currently left blank. Importantly, we are not yet applying ANY judgment to this rationale, but simply requiring that SOME attempt be made to explain the payment more than NOTHING!\n\n- The DO-NOT-PAY list of entities known to be fraudulent or people who are dead or are probable fronts for terrorist organizations or do not match Congressional appropriations must actually be implemented and not ignored. Also, it can currently take up to a year to get on this list, which is far too long. This list should be updated at least weekly, if not daily.\n\nThe above super obvious and necessary changes are being implemented by existing, long-time career government employees, not anyone from @DOGE. It is ridiculous that these changes didn’t exist already!\n\nYesterday, I was told that there are currently over $100B/year of entitlements payments to individuals with no SSN or even a temporary ID number. If accurate, this is extremely suspicious. \n\nWhen I asked if anyone at Treasury had a rough guess for what percentage of that number is unequivocal and obvious fraud, the consensus in the room was about half, so $50B/year or $1B/week!!\n\nThis is utterly insane and must be addressed immediately.\n\nThere are a lot of claims packed into this 260 word tweet and thus it requires careful unpacking. \n\nFirst, it is simply false to say that treasury payments do not have a “payment categorization code”. It is notable, by the way, that he uses this completely invented phrase rather than the actual phrase “Treasury Account Symbol” (TAS). Indeed, it's impossible to find another use of this phrase using an internet search engine in any context, let alone the Treasury context. The far more limited “deficiency” pointed out by the Government Accountability Office report Krause referenced is that information about individual government transactions were recorded in multiple different account entries separately by some government agencies and thus individual transactions could not be readily traced through to all the accounting ledgers they effected.\n\nIf your eyes glazed over reading that, don’t worry. All it means is the U.S. government does not currently have, but has been working on creating by Fiscal year 2028 a fully integrated system for tracing individual transactions all across government accounts. Not being able to do this does not mean you can’t “pass financial audits”. If it did, Elon Musk’s companies would certainly not pass a “financial audit”. If your eyes didn’t glaze over reading all that, you can read more starting at page 46 of the GAO report.\n\nOn to Musk’s next claim: the need for “rationales”. The idea of putting a “rationale” for each and every individual payment (or payment file) makes little sense in the context of how the system works. Think of this in your own life: do you fill out a little form that provides your “rationale” for purchasing an item every time you swipe your credit card? If you were required to do so, you would react very negatively for the same reason you should react very negatively here: if you had to put a rationale then someone could reject your spending requests on the basis of providing the “wrong” rationale. \n\nImagine the right wing uproar when the possibility emerged of restricting purchases of meat through such a “rationale for transaction” system. This should be seen as no different. The “Treasury Account Symbol” (TAS) provides the only rationale that should matter which is that congress appropriated the spending. Of course, if you want to abrogate congressional spending then that is obviously not sufficient and, in fact, counterproductive.\n\nSubscribe\n\nWhich brings us to Musk’s commentary on the “Do-Not-Pay” system. As an aside, it is surreal seeing Elon Musk tweet about obscure Bureau of the Fiscal Service systems that most people had not heard of up until two weeks ago. Let alone that even most experts spent no time thinking about these systems except for myself and a few people I know. Anyway, onto assessing Musk’s “claims”. The most common reaction from former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees to Musk’s comments about the Do-Not-Pay system was bewilderment. For example, no one is sure what he is talking about when he states that it takes “up to a year” to get on the “Do-Not-Pay list”.\n\nTo understand why Musk's comments are inscrutable to retired career Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees, we must understand what “Do-Not-Pay” actually is. As readers of my first piece in this series understand, this always starts for me with the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) of the system in question. In this case the Assessment states:\n\nThe purpose of the Do Not Pay Business Center is to serve as a “single point of entry” through which agencies access relevant data in order to determine eligibility for a Federal award or payment. PII is used to provide information to agencies to assist in the eligibility verification of Federal awards or payments. It supports the mission of the Bureau by strengthening the payment integrity program through focusing on data-centric decision making and improvements to payment data quality. This supports Strategic Objective 4.2: Reduce improper payments and the potential for fraud. [emphasis added]\n\nThe key here is that this system is an “entry way” for agencies to access data. \n\nWhy did the Bureau of the Fiscal Service create the “Do-Not-Pay” system? According to my sources, government agencies were each trying to get access to datasets on their own to verify payments. This was cumbersome, difficult and required a lot of effort because there were complex statutory restrictions on how data could be used, accessed and privacy protections became ensured between government agencies. Remember that all data about individuals in government systems are subject to privacy laws in order to protect every American’s privacy. As one former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee put it:\n\nYou could take the phonebook- well no one knows what a phonebook is anymore- but anyway you could take a phonebook and dump it into a government database and it would be subject to privacy laws\n\nThus what the BFS provides with the “Do-Not-Pay” system is access to a series of databases which have already gone through an extensive process to ensure privacy rights are respected as well as checks to ensure conformity to other statutory limitations on such data.\n\nThe key to understanding this issue is to grasp that this system is a supplementary data service. Individual agencies have access to all sorts of data that is not accessible on “Do-Not-Pay”. The databases Do-Not-Pay provides access to are in fact pretty limited (see for yourself). This is why payments are certified and recertified by agencies themselves. Agencies are the ones best suited to know whether a payment is “proper”. Thus, it's wrong to think of “Do-Not-Pay” as a system where, if payment files get run through it and get flagged, those payments are necessarily improper or fraudulent and thus will not go out.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAs a former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee stated to me:\n\nWe always [at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service] felt the name 'Do-Not-Pay' was something of a misnomer. It was a data verification service to help determine payment eligibility [emphasis added]\n\nThere are all sorts of factors that go into whether a payment is “improper” or “proper”. Let alone fraudulent. In commenting on this issue, a former BFS employee explained:\n\nIs the payment fraudulent? It's not always a “yes/no” question. I can't program “if Jane Doe dies on this date” it's fraud. The agency has to assess to the details and complex statutory rules behind payment eligibility\n\nOne former BFS employee put it concisely:\n\nFiscal Service is never gonna know whether someone needs a wheelchair or not\n\nThus when Musk says that this system “must actually be implemented and not ignored”, what he is really saying is that a limited and supplementary service should have the final say on whether a payment goes out even though that has no basis in law and involves a willful misunderstanding of what this system does.\n\nThis all goes back to Musk’s tendency to think that there is, can be or should be a “button” that determines all of this and its corrupt, inefficient bureaucrats preventing this from happening. He simply doesn’t understand how complex these systems are or why they are the way they are. Take the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) for instance. It is a Bureau of the Fiscal Service system for collecting delinquent federal or state debts. One former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee explained to me that there are rules that determine:\n\nwhen treasury can intercept a payment. Jane Doe owes this debt, we check if Jane Doe's due process is being respected. These statutory rules are very complex and the business logic has built up over many years\n\nThe rules that determine whether or how the Treasury can collect a debt are very complex and difficult to code in a way that respects evolving statutes. Recall our discussion on Tuesday of last week that these systems are complex not because they are coded in COBOL but because of the years and years of particular code which determines how a specific system operates in a particular way. This system specific code or “logic” is known by the phrase “business logic”.\n\nOne possible source of Musk’s complaint that it can take “up to a year” to get on this list is he is complaining about the ability of, say, a contractor to appeal before he is “debarred”. In other words, he is complaining about due process rights as “inefficient”. Another is that Musk is complaining that states can take a long time to report someone’s death. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service is very cognizant of improper payments and constantly trying to reduce them, as we discussed in my initial piece in this series. As one former BFS employee said:\n\nTreasury is always looking for ways to avoid improper payments at this late date i.e. after an agency has submitted payments [...] on its face it seems you can program that but when you get into the details its very challenging\n\nIt’s much easier to rely on agencies and improve their internal controls. But this is unsatisfactory when your real goal is not reducing improper and fraudulent payments but centralizing control in order to pursue unconstitutional spending delays and cuts that bend everyone else to your will. \n\nSubscribe\n\nTo include my own editorial comment for a moment, this is why it's so alarming to see him talk about updating this list “weekly, or even daily”. This strongly suggests to me that he is talking about arbitrarily and rapidly expanding the list of people and entities on lists such as the Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC) list without any due process to block them from government payments. As I discussed the Wednesday before last, the apparatuses for capriciously destroying the financial life of disfavored entities and people has been constructed over multiple decades with active Democratic participation and support. Now they are in the hands of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Thus, again, Musk’s comments hide a desire for unchecked power over others under a false narrative about governmental “inefficiency”. \n\nMy sources are also very skeptical that any career Treasury employee told Elon Musk that half of the expenditures that constituted “entitlements payments to individuals with no SSN” were “unequivocal and obvious fraud”. It's hard to say more without knowing the context. This is the difficult thing with government by the pronouncement of Elon Musk. He can say stuff without any corroboration much faster than anyone else can check facts or correct falsehoods. \n\nFinally, and separately from the Musk tweet, I asked sources about what they thought readers should think about Vona Robinson’s and  Joseph Gioeli’s sworn affidavits which I discussed Wednesday. For obvious reasons former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees were reluctant to comment on their former colleagues directly. However, one former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee carefully stated that they:\n\nwould read the affirmations of the career BFS civil servants against the BFS civil service's long history of being non-partisan and taking following the law very seriously\n\nIt is certainly the case that the statements from the career civil servants who gave sworn testimony are the most trustworthy of all the statements. It's no coincidence that they are also the most informative and disturbing. The extent to which those statements were shaped by the intense pressure from political appointees remains to be seen. \n\nThe only relief that comes from the Musk tweet is it seems to point towards an obsession with impoundment over the operational control of the Treasury payments system. He seems to be satisfied, at least for now, with political control of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service coming down from on high and leading to system changes that facilitate “Payment System Level” impoundment. He has backed off tweeting about BFS. As discussed yesterday, they have already gotten quite far in that process. It's our job to stop them. \n\nIn the meantime, it is exhausting how much effort is required to deconstruct one Elon Musk tweet. He can lie about very complex and technical systems much faster than he can be answered, but nevertheless it's important to periodically critically assess what the richest man in the world is saying as he continually tries to justify chopping the government up and selling it for parts like this is a private equity takeover. \n\n\n\nSubscribeTip!Institutional subscription detailsPrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><strong>Notes on the Crises pivoted on February 1st into around the clock coverage of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025.

The system meltdown and privacy concerns have become less dramatic than they were last week but the constitutional crisis <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>we were already in</u></a> has only intensified at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. In <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>my last piece</u></a> I went deep into the sworn testimony of current U.S. Treasury officials to understand what’s been going on.&nbsp;</p><p>What they revealed is that soon-to-be Fiscal Assistant Secretary and Musk “ally”&nbsp; Tom Krause is openly talking about using the payment system to pursue “impoundment”. He is pursuing this by rhetorically defining payments that would contravene the Trump administration’s unconstitutional executive orders as “improper”. These “affirmations” also reveal that payment level impoundment has gotten quite far, including <strong>sending payment files from one agency for review by another</strong>. Since when does the <strong>State Department have oversight</strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><strong><u> authority over Health and Human Services’s appropriations</u></strong></a><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>After my piece on Wednesday I became interested in examining what is referred to as the “Do-Not-Pay” system more deeply. This is for a few reasons. First, Musk is clearly quite fixated on it (a point we’ll return to) and unfortunately technical policy debates now are deeply impacted by the … unsteady commentary from Elon Musk and his twitter account. Second, the affirmations I discussed in my last piece illustrated that the impoundment process DOGE and the Trump administration has been envisioning is conceived by DOGE as operationally resembling the Do-Not-Pay system even if their legal purposes are the opposite of each other. For one thing, one is meant to align spending with the constitutional requirement to follow congressional appropriations and the other is an unconstitutional seizure of Congress’s power of the purse.</p><p>In my view, this means getting a better understanding of “Do-Not-Pay” is key to understanding the future of what we might call <strong>“Payment System Level” impoundment</strong> rather than<strong> “Administrative Agency Level” impoundment</strong>.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>I also wanted to give an indirect opportunity for former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees to respond to things Elon Musk has been saying. The richest man in the world has been attacking the <strong>work of diligent public servants who can’t speak up in public</strong> either because of fear of losing their jobs or simply being targeted by Musk and/or the Trump administration (in the case of former BFS employees). I have enormous respect for these people and it is painful to get to know them in the context of these erratic, vague and confused attacks on their underfunded and critical work. Some of what former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees have to say will appear in this piece in <strong>the form of anonymous quotes</strong> while other information will be <strong>represented by my own words but reflect “on background” sources</strong>. Further, when using names for an example on the record I told all my sources to use the name “Jane Doe”.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc4MjGNi3ndOElOAZR4z-j8oNoKOQsXtSdjjmZBiIzGhkRU7uxvXkfa4mbX4JD9iuNdY3nZm2RHHMPhXLZS-zej0EUkBJ_Gz2pGoEgY1dgrglpNM5OWT1FTHD3Ajl7hWNJKjZYE?key=QcoRcZWXAztK0TfBwvF7TPTk\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"541\" height=\"772\"></figure><p>But first, time to read one (very long) <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1888314848477376744?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Elon Musk tweet from February 8th, 2:51 PM</u></a>:</p><blockquote>To be clear, what the @DOGE&nbsp; team and @USTreasury have jointly agreed makes sense is the following:</blockquote><blockquote>- Require that all outgoing government payments have a payment categorization code, which is necessary in order to pass financial audits. This is frequently left blank, making audits almost impossible.</blockquote><blockquote>- All payments must also include a rationale for the payment in the comment field, which is currently left blank. Importantly, we are not yet applying ANY judgment to this rationale, but simply requiring that SOME attempt be made to explain the payment more than NOTHING!</blockquote><blockquote>- The DO-NOT-PAY list of entities known to be fraudulent or people who are dead or are probable fronts for terrorist organizations or do not match Congressional appropriations must actually be implemented and not ignored. Also, it can currently take up to a year to get on this list, which is far too long. This list should be updated at least weekly, if not daily.</blockquote><blockquote>The above super obvious and necessary changes are being implemented by existing, long-time career government employees, not anyone from @DOGE. It is ridiculous that these changes didn’t exist already!</blockquote><blockquote>Yesterday, I was told that there are currently over $100B/year of entitlements payments to individuals with no SSN or even a temporary ID number. If accurate, this is extremely suspicious.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>When I asked if anyone at Treasury had a rough guess for what percentage of that number is unequivocal and obvious fraud, the consensus in the room was about half, so $50B/year or $1B/week!!</blockquote><blockquote>This is utterly insane and must be addressed immediately.</blockquote><p>There are a lot of claims packed into this 260 word tweet and thus it requires careful unpacking.&nbsp;</p><p>First, it is simply false to say that treasury payments do not have a “payment categorization code”. It is notable, by the way, that <strong>he uses this completely invented phrase rather than the actual phrase “Treasury Account Symbol” (TAS)</strong>. Indeed, it's impossible to find another use of this phrase using an internet search engine in any context, let alone the Treasury context. The far more limited “deficiency” pointed out by the Government Accountability Office <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-104786?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>report Krause referenced</u></a> is that information about individual government transactions were recorded in multiple different account entries separately by some government agencies and thus individual transactions could not be readily traced through to all the accounting ledgers they effected.</p><p>If your eyes glazed over reading that, don’t worry. All it means is the U.S. government does not currently have, but has been working on creating by Fiscal year 2028 a fully integrated system for tracing individual transactions all across government accounts. Not being able to do this does not mean you can’t “pass financial audits”. If it did, <strong>Elon Musk’s companies would certainly not pass a “financial audit”</strong>. If your eyes <strong>didn’t glaze over reading all that</strong>, you can read more <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-104786?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>starting at page 46 of the GAO report</u></a>.</p><p>On to Musk’s next claim: the need for “rationales”. The idea of putting a “rationale” for each and every individual payment (or payment file) makes little sense in the context of how the system works. Think of this in your own life: do you fill out a little form that provides your “rationale” for purchasing an item every time you swipe your credit card? If you were required to do so, you would react very negatively for the same reason you should react very negatively here: if you had to put a rationale then someone could reject your spending requests on the basis of providing the “wrong” rationale.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine the right wing uproar when the possibility emerged of restricting purchases of meat through such a “rationale for transaction” system. This should be seen as no different. The “Treasury Account Symbol” (TAS) provides the only rationale that should matter which is that <strong>congress appropriated the spending.</strong> Of course, if you want to abrogate congressional spending then that is obviously not sufficient and, in fact, counterproductive.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Which brings us to Musk’s commentary on the “Do-Not-Pay” system. As an aside, it is surreal seeing Elon Musk tweet about obscure Bureau of the Fiscal Service systems that most people had not heard of up until two weeks ago. Let alone that even most experts spent no time thinking about these systems except for myself and a few people I know. Anyway, onto assessing Musk’s “claims”. The most common reaction from former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees to Musk’s comments about the Do-Not-Pay system was bewilderment. For example, no one is sure what he is talking about when he states that it takes “up to a year” to get on the “Do-Not-Pay list”.</p><p>To understand why Musk's comments are inscrutable to retired career Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees, we must understand what “Do-Not-Pay” actually is. As readers of my first piece in this series understand, this always starts for me with the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) of the system in question. In this case <a href=\"https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/files/pia/dnp-pclia.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the Assessment states</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The purpose of the Do Not Pay Business Center is to <strong>serve as a “single point of entry” through which agencies access relevant data in order to determine eligibility for a Federal award or payment.</strong> PII is used to provide information to agencies to assist in the eligibility verification of Federal awards or payments. It supports the mission of the Bureau by strengthening the payment integrity program through focusing on data-centric decision making and improvements to payment data quality. This supports Strategic Objective 4.2: Reduce improper payments and the potential for fraud. [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>The key here is that this system is an “entry way” for agencies to access data.&nbsp;</p><p>Why did the Bureau of the Fiscal Service create the “Do-Not-Pay” system? According to my sources, government agencies were each trying to get access to datasets on their own to verify payments. This was cumbersome, difficult and required a lot of effort because there were complex statutory restrictions on how data could be used, accessed and privacy protections became ensured between government agencies. Remember that all data about individuals in government systems are subject to privacy laws in order to protect every American’s privacy. As one former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee put it:</p><blockquote>You could take the phonebook- well no one knows what a phonebook is anymore- but anyway you could take a phonebook and dump it into a government database and it would be subject to privacy laws</blockquote><p>Thus what the BFS provides with the “Do-Not-Pay” system is access to a series of databases which have already gone through an extensive process to ensure privacy rights are respected as well as checks to ensure conformity to other statutory limitations on such data.</p><p>The key to understanding this issue is to grasp that this system is a <strong>supplementary data service</strong>. Individual agencies have access to all sorts of data that is not accessible on “Do-Not-Pay”. The databases Do-Not-Pay provides access to are in fact pretty limited (<a href=\"https://fiscal.treasury.gov/dnp/search.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>see for yourself</u></a>). This is why payments are certified and recertified by agencies themselves. Agencies are the ones best suited to know whether a payment is “proper”. Thus, it's wrong to think of “Do-Not-Pay” as a system where, if payment files get run through it and get flagged, those payments are necessarily improper or fraudulent and thus will not go out.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>As a former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee stated to me:</p><blockquote>We always [at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service] felt <strong>the name 'Do-Not-Pay' was something of a misnomer</strong>. It was a data verification service to help determine payment eligibility [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>There are all sorts of factors that go into whether a payment is “improper” or “proper”. Let alone fraudulent. In commenting on this issue, a former BFS employee explained:</p><blockquote>Is the payment fraudulent? It's not always a “yes/no” question. I can't program “if Jane Doe dies on this date” it's fraud. The agency has to assess to the details and complex statutory rules behind payment eligibility</blockquote><p>One former BFS employee put it concisely:</p><blockquote>Fiscal Service is never gonna know whether someone needs a wheelchair or not</blockquote><p>Thus when Musk says that this system “must actually be implemented and not ignored”, what he is really saying is that a limited and supplementary service should have the final say on whether a payment goes out even though that has no basis in law and involves a willful misunderstanding of what this system does.</p><p>This all goes back to Musk’s tendency to think that there is, can be or should be a “button” that determines all of this and its corrupt, inefficient bureaucrats preventing this from happening. He simply doesn’t understand how complex these systems are or why they are the way they are. Take the <a href=\"https://fiscal.treasury.gov/top/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Treasury Offset Program (TOP)</u></a> for instance. It is a Bureau of the Fiscal Service system for collecting delinquent federal or state debts. One former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee explained to me that there are rules that determine:</p><blockquote>when treasury can intercept a payment. Jane Doe owes this debt, we check if Jane Doe's due process is being respected. These statutory rules are very complex and the business logic has built up over many years</blockquote><p>The rules that determine whether or how the Treasury can collect a debt are very complex and difficult to code in a way that respects evolving statutes. Recall our discussion on <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>Tuesday of last week</u></a> that these systems are complex not because they are coded in COBOL but because of the years and years of particular code which determines how a specific system operates in a particular way. This system specific code or “logic” is known by the phrase “business logic”.</p><p>One possible source of Musk’s complaint that it can take “up to a year” to get on this list is he is complaining about the ability of, say, a contractor to appeal before he is “debarred”. In other words, he is complaining about due process rights as “inefficient”. Another is that Musk is complaining that states can take a long time to report someone’s death. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service is very cognizant of improper payments and constantly trying to reduce them, as we discussed in <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>my initial piece in this series</u></a>. As one former BFS employee said:</p><blockquote>Treasury is always looking for ways to avoid improper payments at this late date i.e. after an agency has submitted payments [...] on its face it seems you can program that but when you get into the details its very challenging</blockquote><p>It’s much easier to rely on agencies and improve their internal controls. But this is unsatisfactory when your real goal is not reducing improper and fraudulent payments but centralizing control in order to pursue unconstitutional spending delays and cuts that bend everyone else to your will.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>To include my own editorial comment for a moment, this is why it's so alarming to see him talk about updating this list “weekly, or even daily”. This strongly suggests to me that he is talking about arbitrarily and rapidly expanding the list of people and entities on lists such as the <a href=\"https://fiscal.treasury.gov/dnp/search.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC) list</u></a> without any due process to block them from government payments. As I discussed the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-six-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025/\"><u>Wednesday before last</u></a>, the apparatuses for capriciously destroying the financial life of disfavored entities and people has been constructed over multiple decades with active Democratic participation and support. Now they are in the hands of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Thus, again, Musk’s comments hide a desire for unchecked power over others under a false narrative about governmental “inefficiency”.&nbsp;</p><p>My sources are also very skeptical that any career Treasury employee told Elon Musk that half of the expenditures that constituted “entitlements payments to individuals with no SSN” were “unequivocal and obvious fraud”. It's hard to say more without knowing the context. This is the difficult thing with government by the pronouncement of Elon Musk. He can say stuff without any corroboration much faster than anyone else can check facts or correct falsehoods.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, and separately from the Musk tweet, I asked sources about what they thought readers should think about Vona Robinson’s and&nbsp; Joseph Gioeli’s sworn affidavits <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>which I discussed Wednesday</u></a>. For obvious reasons former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees were reluctant to comment on their former colleagues directly. However, one former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee carefully stated that they:</p><blockquote>would read the affirmations of the career BFS civil servants against the BFS civil service's long history of being non-partisan and taking following the law very seriously</blockquote><p>It is certainly the case that the statements from the career civil servants who gave sworn testimony are the most trustworthy of all the statements. It's no coincidence that they are also the most informative and disturbing. The extent to which those statements were shaped by the intense pressure from political appointees remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p><p>The only relief that comes from the Musk tweet is it seems to point towards an obsession with impoundment over the operational control of the Treasury payments system. He seems to be satisfied, at least for now, with political control of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service coming down from on high and leading to system changes that facilitate “Payment System Level” impoundment. He has backed off tweeting about BFS. As discussed yesterday, they have already gotten quite far in that process. It's our job to stop them.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, it is exhausting how much effort is required to deconstruct one Elon Musk tweet. He can lie about very complex and technical systems much faster than he can be answered, but nevertheless it's important to periodically critically assess what the richest man in the world is saying as he continually tries to justify chopping the government up and selling it for parts like this is a private equity takeover.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a

Here's my address: bc1qegxarzsfga9ycesfa7wm77sqmuqqv7083c6ss6\n\nMini-Media Round Up\n\nI’ve gotten and done so much media since this crisis started that it's hard to keep up with it all. As a result, I think I’m going to devote an entire piece to just going through the various media outlets which have cited or interviewed me and that I have yet to link to. For today, I’m just going to cite three especially notable citations to my work. The first is not media “strictly speaking”. However, I will mention it yesterday. Apparently last Friday the “Ranking Member” of the house democrats Committee On Education and Workforce Robert Scott cited my article breaking the news that Marko Elez had “read and write” access in a letter to the Government Accountability Office asking them to investigate this issue. It's always both appreciated and important to get congressional traction with your reporting\n\n.\n\nThe second is Robert Reich who, among other things, was President Clinton’s secretary of Labor from 1993 to 1997. Reich says in a piece Friday:\n\nMusk’s rats continue to burrow into sensitive government payment systems.\n\nAccording to the best source I’ve found on this (Nathan Tankus’s Crises Notes), Musk and his rats have now gained unrestricted access to your Social Security number, your confidential bank information, your confidential medical information, and much more. [emphasis added]\n\nSo thank you Robert.\n\nThe Third notable citation is an especially generous new citation from economist Paul Krugman:\n\nNow, the enemies of democracy will keep trying to find new ways to undermine rule of law. I have to admit that I never even thought about the federal payments system as a target before the news of Musk’s antics was broken. Special credit goes to Nathan Tankus, an expert on “the technical details of monetary policy”, who has become the man of the moment. [emphasis added]\n\nSo thank you Paul. Both on my own behalf as well as on behalf of the Viking press publicists popping champagne somewhere.\n\nMonday I ended my last piece by listing the topics I would write about in my next piece. What I didn’t list is what broke late afternoon/evening yesterday. Specifically, in new court filings the Treasury confirms Wired, Talking Points Memo and my reporting that Marko Elez had read & write access to top secret payments systems. This is of course a huge validation of my work in this newsletter last week and affirms the credibility of the investigative journalism I choose to undertake in the future. \n\nI got a huge scoop and only missed breaking the story Wired broke by 6.5 hours overnight. I broke other stories which only appeared subsequently in other outlets and have details still not confirmed by other outlets. This is a major new stage in what I can do with this newsletter and builds trust with potential future sources, making it even easier to do investigative journalism in the future. In some ways the most important validation is that the Washington Post is crediting this newsletter with having gotten to this story along with Wired, which will lead other mainstream outlets to properly credit Notes on the Crises as well: \n\nThe Treasury Department had previously stated that Elez was only granted “read-only” access to the payment system, although reporting by Wired and the financial newsletter Notes on the Crises had questioned that assertion.\n\nThanks to Jeff Stein for this citation and all of his advice and support since January 31st as I first caught up to this issue and then jumped headfirst into breaking news myself.\n\nSubscribe\n\nOf course, as nice as it is to get deserved credit, the substance of this confirmation is also worth looking at closely. Normally I try to avoid big block quotes from court filings (okay, who am I kidding) but I think the full quote is important here. I’ve uploaded five court documents to my website for ease of access and posterity’s sake (find them linked together below). First up, Joseph Gioeli III’s sworn affirmation, who is “Deputy Commissioner of Transformation and Modernization” at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service:\n\nOn the morning of February 6, it was discovered that Mr. Elez’s database access to SPS on February 5 had mistakenly been configured with read/write permissions instead of read-only. A forensic investigation was immediately initiated by database administrators to review all activities performed on that server and database. The initial investigation confirmed that all of Mr. Elez’s interactions with the SPS system occurred within the supervised, walk-through session and that no unauthorized actions had taken place. His access was promptly corrected to read-only, and he did not log into the system again after his initial virtual over-the-shoulder session on February 5. To the best of our knowledge, Mr. Elez never knew of the fact that he briefly had read/write permissions for the SPS database, and never took any action to exercise the “write” privileges in order to modify anything within the SPS database—indeed, he never logged in during the time that he had read/write privileges, other than during the virtual walk-through – and forensic analysis is currently underway to confirm this. [emphasis added]\n\nWhen I first read this paragraph, I laughed for about a minute straight in incredulity and disbelief. \n\nWhat you are being asked to believe is that the most sensitive systems in the world, systems being scrutinized by much of the world for the first time, had “accidentally” been put under the full control of Marko Elez. You are also being asked to believe that this applied to only one system and the investigation launched was just to “make sure” nothing “bad” happened during this “accident”. And what do you know, they confirmed it! What is interesting about this story is it is perfectly shaped to fit the reporting from Wired and myself as much as possible while providing an innocuous explanation. This is roughly the equivalent of a student giving the excuse “I slipped on a banana peel and my dog ate my homework”. Apparently the Trump-Musk Treasury department has innovated in the field of slapstick comedy far beyond the capacity of Charlie Chaplin to imagine.\n\nSubscribe\n\nIts especially interesting that they are claiming that this only happened with SPS since, while my sources confirmed Wired’s reporting about Marko Elez’s access to the Secure Payment System (SPS) and the Payment Automation Manager (PAM), my subsequent reporting confirmed evolutions of Marko Elez’s access to SPS but could not confirm evolutions of his access to other systems. This leaves two possibilities. The first is that the Treasury is shaping its answers to provide a rationale that is consistent with reporting from multiple sources but only to what they perceive is the extent necessary. These statements are their assessment of that, triangulating between Wired and my reporting.\n\nThe second is that they know only a small circle of very high level Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees could definitively know they are lying. Thus they either feel secure that these claims won’t be disconfirmed or their disconfirmation would facilitate finding an important security leak. These two different possibilities are obviously interrelated insofar as only confirming read/write access to SPS obliviates much of the power of lower level current Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees as sources (please still get in contact securely over Signal nevertheless). There is also the possibility that they expect counterclaims to have less force if they actually follow through on not having DOGE employees directly interact with these systems, even on a read only basis, anymore. More on this later.\n\nThese documents also confirm that Elez had direct access to source code and even that he was changing source code but only in a “sandbox” environment. Specifically, Gioeli states:\n\nBureau provided Mr. Elez with the Bureau laptop and with copies of the source code for PAM, SPS, and ASAP in a separate, secure coding environment known as a “secure code repository” or “sandbox.” Mr. Elez could review and make changes locally to copies of the source code in the cordoned-off code repository; however, he did not have the authority or capability to publish any code changes to the production system or underlying test environments.\n\nNote that this is also a statement which provides an “innocuous” explanation for reporting last week, including Josh Marshall’s early reporting at Talking Points Memo of “source code changes” which neither Wired or I could confirm. This clearly appears to be an effort to tie all these issues up in a nice, tidy bow.\n\nAs I’ve made clear, I find the convenience of these explanations preposterous but I want to emphasize that aside from the fact that I stand by the accuracy of all my reporting, I do not have specific information at the time of writing to facilitate refuting Treasury’s new stories. I also want to emphasize what both Wired and I have explained in our reporting. “Read only” access is still “catastrophic” and it does not matter very much whether dangerous, and possibly unconstitutional, code is put into testing and production by a DOGE employee themselves or ordered by DOGE and implemented by career civil servants at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Nor does modifying the payment system to implement unconstitutional directives at the operational level even necessarily require “read only” access.\n\nWhich brings us to Thomas Krause’s sworn “affirmation” yesterday. Recall that he is the Musk ally installed in a senior position and the only other person the initial injunction allowed “read only” access in addition to Marko Elez. His statement is not all that interesting regarding the facts about Marko Elez but it does provide some plausible and useful claims such as “Currently, I am the only Treasury DOGE team member.” and confirms the reporting that he will soon become “Fiscal Assistant Secretary” i.e. taking David Lebryk’s old position. There is also a key phrase in his affirmation which gives the whole game away:\n\n(2) ensuring that the Treasury DOGE Team was leveraging its unique technological expertise to help operationalize the President’s policy priorities for the early days of the Administration, including by helping identify payments that may be improper under his new Executive Orders.  [emphasis added]\n\nWhen I wrote my piece published the morning of February 3rd I was hoping that my rhetorical question about improper payments was ghoulish overkill:\n\nIs “Wokeness,” the “Green New Deal,” “Marxism,” and “Gender Ideology” going to be the new definition of an “improper payment\"? [emphasis added]\n\nIt turns out that I was dead on, unfortunately. \n\nSubscribe\n\nTo spell this out explicitly, the Krause statement is an admission, perhaps inadvertent, that they are pursuing using BFS systems to impound spending and they are going to rhetorically cover this by defining impounded spending as “improper payments”. As I stated in that piece, improper payments are in the eye of the beholder (in this situation).\n\nWhich brings us to the key question of making impoundment at the payments level operational. These documents have valuable details about their approach to building the technical machinery of impoundment. The downside is that we have to go through… details about the technical machinery of impoundment. Krause states:\n\nOne initial goal of the engagement was to ensure that all payments through BFS’s payment systems included Treasury Account Symbols (TAS) and Business Event Type Codes (BETCs), which are used to identify what type of payment and accounts each payment request is associated with. These are the kinds of enhanced controls suggested in the March 30, 2023 GAO Report [emphasis added]\n\nThis is a tricky area to discuss because unlike most of the nonsense coming out of the Trump administration on this issue, there is a real issue and legitimate purpose related to Krause’s statement. That is not particularly impressive nor does it validate DOGE’s activities, it is simply an indication of how outrageously otherworldly and maliciously false so much of the discourse about this issue has been.\n\nSubscribe\n\nFirst, what are “Treasury Account Symbols”? The GAO report Krause invokes defines them as:\n\nA TAS is a unique identification code that the Department of the Treasury, in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), assigns to a federal entity’s individual appropriation, receipt, or other fund account [emphasis added]\n\nA Business Event Type code, in turn, is just a code that identifies an activity related to that appropriation such as a disbursement or a collection. The key here is that if you can identify a specific appropriation by its TAS code, you can block the specific appropriations you do not like. This goes far beyond simply blocking payments from an entire agency which was my early concern which turned out to be entirely valid.\n\nIt's important to understand that while Krause is telling the truth that ensuring all payments had TAS and BETC codes has been a regularly suggested improvement to internal controls and one that both the Bureau of the Fiscal Service itself, in addition to the GAO, has pursued, he is avoiding saying that he is looking to put them to an entirely new and dangerous purpose. The GAO report he invokes, for example, explicitly states that they are pursuing this internal control improvement to facilitate identifying and closing:\n\nTASs established during the annual fiscal year-end rollover process that do not subsequently have corresponding appropriations supporting the period of availability.\n\nIn other words, this control was originally intended to ensure that agency spending is in line with congressional appropriations, not ignoring appropriations and unilaterally reducing agency spending below agency appropriations to suit their own ideological purposes. So while the internal control is legitimate, the purpose they are aiming to use it for is not. If you are an employee of the Government Accountability Office and would like to discuss my analysis, please contact me securely over signal (or email if you are comfortable with that).\n\nIncidentally, Krause’s statements also confirm that Elon Musk was lying when he claimed that they do not check payments: \n\nIn the normal course, when an agency initially provides a payment file to BFS through its PAM system, BFS conducts certain reviews of that file (known as “pre-edit”) before requesting that the agency certify the payment, after which point the file is processed through BFS’s systems. An example of a check that occurs during the pre-certification phase is to compare the payments in the file against the Do Not Pay working system, which is used to identify payments that may be improper or fraudulent. If transaction(s) in a payment file lead to a match when screened through the Do Not Pay working system, BFS notifies the submitting agency, which is given an opportunity to reexamine the payment file to determine whether to ultimately certify it for processing [emphasis added]\n\nThus, the only sense in which Musk’s original tweet remains remotely true is that the payment is not outright “denied” but sent back to an agency for investigation and possible recertification. It may seem quant to continually fact check Musk tweets from two weeks ago but it's important to keep track of the shifting rationalizations and justifications to emphasize that the reasoning and claims are changing to accomplish the same goal: abrogating the constitution in service of centralizing power in the executive branch and subordinating both Congress and the Judiciary. \n\nSubscribe\n\nIn this iteration of these rationalizations, Krause attempts to present impoundment at the operational BFS level as a reasonable corollary to the “do not pay” checks that already happen.\n\nOur work to implement the President’s foreign aid Executive Order was intended to operate similarly. The plan we implemented included identifying payments files in the pre-edit phase, prior to certification and processing, that may fall within the scope of the Executive order and, thus, require review by the State Department, as the authorized agency under the Executive Order, to determine whether they fall within the scope of the Executive Order but should receive a waiver, or whether instead the payor agency should pause the payment pursuant to the Executive Order [emphasis added]\n\nThis is, of course, sophistry. The operational process may be similar but the purpose is entirely different. Of course impoundment would operationally look similar to a “do not pay” check, they are looking to stop payments! But the purpose of the current “do not pay” system is to align agency disbursements with congressional appropriations and a “freeze spending” check is expressly intended to abrogate congressional appropriations. Hence why Trump’s head of the OMB has put such emphasis on the alleged illegality of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974!\n\n02/11/25 Document 28 “Memorandum Opinion and Order”\n\n02/11/25 Document 31 “Wenzler Affirmation”\n\n02/11/25 Document 32 “Robinson Affirmation”\n\n02/11/25 Document 33 “Krause Affirmation”\n\n02/11/25 Document 34 “Gioeli Affirmation”\n\nWhich brings me to Vona S. Robinson’s affirmation (for completeness and ease of perusal, I’m linking all the files above together above, including a couple of files I do not discuss in this piece). Robinson provides a lot more details which affirm and intensify the reasons to be concerned about Krause’s testimony above. She also provides clear details in general. In fact, I’m going to quote her description of how the Bureau of the Fiscal Service traditionally processes payments simply because it’s worth reading to better understand what we have been talking about the last two weeks:\n\nWithin PAM, PAM’s “file system” receives payment files from payor agencies into its “landing zone,” which is the existing system that ingests payment files before agencies certify the payments for processing. When payment files come into the “landing zone,” they are transferred to the PAM application where the payment file is validated and a preedit report is generated and sent back to the Federal Agency that contains, among other things, information about potentially improper or fraudulent payments. The Federal Agency uses this report to certify the payments in the SPS system, after which the payments are processed consistent with the instructions within the file.\n\nThis again affirms the falsity of Musk’s earlier claims. I’ll get to assessing Musk’s recent tweets in the context of these court affirmations tomorrow… unless more news breaks. \n\nSubscribe\n\nCrucially, Robinson’s statement provides confirmation to CNN’s bombshell reporting about payment level impoundment regarding USAID. It also adds new alarming details about just how far payment level impoundment has gotten. As far as I’m aware, as of publication I’m the first source to cover these disturbing revelations. Specifically, they have already moved beyond a stop payment process for agencies to stopping payment at the Treasury Account Code (TAS) level:\n\nOn January 31, the Bureau was directed to (1) identify incoming specific Agency payment files to the “landing zone” that met 4 specified Treasury Account Symbol (TAS) codes,—I understand that those TAS codes had been associated with categories of payments that were not USAID payments, but which nonetheless may have been covered under the foreign aid Executive Order; (2) create a copy of the payment files with those TAS codes—the original payment files would remain in the landing zone to ensure payment integrity; (3) move those copies into a separate folder (the “MoveIT” folder) where they could be sent to authorized officials at the State Department for review; (4) deliver the copies to authorized staff at the State Department through a secure portal that was limited in access to certain designated Department of State officials, for same-day review, and (5) allow those State Department officials to determine whether the Executive Order required a pause, or whether the original payment files should move forward into PAM’s processing system for disbursement according to Treasury’s normal payment processes. [emphasis added]\n\nLet's break this down. \n\nWhat Vona Robinson is saying is that the Trump administration has already reached beyond stopping payments from agencies they do not like to stopping specific appropriations they do not like regardless of the agency doing the spending. In the examples she describes a flagged payment file is left in the processing stage but a copy is produced, placed in a different folder and that folder’s contents can be sent to an administrative agency using a “secure portal”. That folder which leads to files being sent to an agency is called the “MoveIT” folder. What the officials at the agency are “supposed to be” doing according to the Trump administration is reviewing them for “violations” of the president’s executive orders which unconstitutionally order sweeping spending freezes. Thus, this process is operationally elevating executive orders above all other laws.\n\nSubscribe\n\nWhat non-USAID appropriations were flagged? You might think that they were non-USAID, state department expenditures because of Robinson’s description above. This is perhaps the most disturbing part: they were not:\n\nOne TAS code was associated with the Millenium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and three TAS codes were associated with certain payments from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). These included two sub-accounts labeled “Refugee and Entrant Assistance, Admin for Children and Families,” one account labeled “Gifts and Donations Office of Refugee Resettlement, Admin for Children and Families,” and one account labeled “Refugee Resettlement Assistance, Administration for Children and Families, Health and Human Services.” \n\nBesides the despicable nature of pursuing freezing the spending they were flagging, this affirmation essentially communicates that a government agency, a cabinet level one no less, was not involved in the review process of its own appropriations. This is much worse than anything that had previously been in the public domain. The fact that these are international payments and in some general sense “state department related” does not make them automatically subject to State department review (at least as far as I’m aware. If there is any statutory basis for State department review, please let me know and I will correct my error).\n\nOf course, reviewing payment files manually is a high effort process and will not scale to the extent that DOGE and the Trump administration desire. This is why Robinson’s statements about manual review are crucial. Specifically: \n\nAt the outset, I understand that BFS career staff queried the PAM file system manually to identify payment files and shared those payment files with Mr. Elez for review through the MoveIT folder. I further understand that, at some point after January 31, Mr. Elez assisted in automating the manual review of the payment files. [emphasis added]\n\nIt is unclear whether this \"automation\" of the \"manual review\" was a source code change or an API overlay. Based on discussions with programmers unfamiliar with the situation, who also reference public reporting about the quality of programming skills DOGE employees seem to have had, it is commonly believed that what was constructed was an API overlay. Nevertheless, clarity is needed on this point and an independent investigation into the issue of source code changes. This also means that Marko Elez was directly involved in writing code to automate operationally and unconstitutionally impounding appropriations.\n\nRobinson finishes her affirmation saying that the “State Department review process” has been frozen and that the BFS has not impounded spending “certified” by agencies:\n\nAs of February 10, we have ensured that the State Department review process will not proceed for payment requests within the scope of the TRO order issued in New York v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-39-JJM-PAS (D.R.I.)\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, BFS has not failed to disburse any payment duly certified by a payor agency as a result of the Treasury DOGE Team’s work. To date, no payments, with the exception of the single MCC payment mentioned above, have been delayed or canceled by the payor agency as a result of the re-routing and review process described herein.\n\nThis is not particularly comforting.\n\nThe Trump administration may currently claim that they were not “freezing” spending without the agency’s approval before the temporary restraining order but, first of all, “freezing” i.e. impounding spending is still unconstitutional whether it's done at the agency level or at the payments level. Second of all, and most importantly, the operational capacity to freeze payments is a coercive tool which creates pressure on agencies to comply with illegal presidential executive orders (or illegal interpretations of those executive orders). The obvious fear is that non-compliance will lead to a worse freezing of payments and leave payment freezes to the sole discretion of whoever in the Treasury will be making these kinds of decisions in the future on DOGE’s behalf. All my fears from two weeks ago about DOGE reaching into the “payments heart” and short circuiting the “bureaucratic trench warfare” opened up by agencies choosing to follow court orders are coming true.\n\nWhat is the take away from all this? It appears that we may have avoided the worst case scenarios of system failure and Marko Elez breaking a system he does not understand. This is important and valuable. We truly were in a potentially apocalyptic scenario last week. My inclination is to believe that they are not going to have one of the 20 something DOGE employees mess around with these extraordinarily sensitive systems (if you are a BFS employee who knows facts to the contrary, please get into contact securely over signal). However, my inclination to believe we’ve avoided the worst case scenarios is based on my informed intuition that the leadership in this area, including Musk, are laser focused on impoundment. Thus the constitutional crisis has still intensified from my first article on January 31st. \n\nMy lack of fear or panic right now is simply based on how fearful I was of the very real threat of total system breakdown. But we are in a, say, 7 alarm constitutional crisis. The focus on data privacy stemmed the bleeding but the Attorney Generals involved with this suit, or some other entities, need to figure out an effective lawsuit over the constitutional issue at hand. Every issue will be affected so every group which is opposed to an unconstitutional and fully imperial, unchecked presidency needs to be laser focused on this issue and form large coalitions to oppose it.\n\nCorrections 3:30 PM: This article has been updated to clarify that source code changes are not necessary to automate a flagging of payment files for Agency (or other) review on the basis of Impoundment-related Trump executive orders\n\nSubscribeTip!Institutional subscription detailsPrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><strong>Notes on the Crises pivoted on February 1st into around the clock coverage of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025</strong></p><p><strong>Read </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><strong><u>Part 0</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><strong><u>Part 1</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><strong><u>Part 2</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-six-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025/\"><strong><u>Part 3</u></strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/changing-the-treasury-payments-source-code-the-treasurys-doge-gag-order/\"><strong><u>Part 4</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-seven-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-yours-and-wireds-reporting-is-actually-doing-something/\"><strong><u>Part 5</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/treasury-secretary-bessents-lawlessness-sorry-readers-read-and-write-code-still-seems-in-play/\"><strong><u>Part 6</u></strong></a><strong> &amp; </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-eleven-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-marko-elezs-resignation-return-and-irrelevance/\"><strong><u>Part 7</u></strong></a></p><p><em>If you are a <strong>current or former career Bureau of the Fiscal Service Employee</strong>, especially if you’re a legacy IT programmer with years of experience<strong> and especially if you are a COBOL programmer currently working on the PAM, SPS or any other adjacent team,</strong> contact me </em><a href=\"mailto:crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><em><u>over email</u></em></a><em> or over signal (a secure and encrypted text messaging app) — </em><a href=\"https://signal.me/?ref=crisesnotes.com#eu/TJspTqx16dD39zG7EKpRYYli9_GTNen7cEL7sAug9gdsPRAdW41JzIywiy5y3lXF\"><em><u>linked here</u></em></a><em>.

What I didn’t list is what broke late afternoon/evening yesterday. Specifically, in new court filings the Treasury confirms Wired, Talking Points Memo and my reporting that Marko Elez had <strong>read &amp; write</strong> access to top secret payments systems. This is of course a huge validation of my work in this newsletter last week and affirms the credibility of the investigative journalism I choose to undertake in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>I got a huge scoop and only missed breaking the story Wired broke <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>by 6.5 hours overnight</u></a>. I broke other stories which only appeared subsequently in other outlets and have details still not confirmed by other outlets. This is a major new stage in what I can do with this newsletter and builds trust with potential future sources, making it even easier to do investigative journalism in the future. In some ways the most important validation is that the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/11/doge-treasury-access-marko-elez/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Washington Post is crediting this newsletter with having gotten to this story along with Wired</u></a>, which will lead other mainstream outlets to properly credit <strong><em>Notes on the Crises </em></strong>as well:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>The Treasury Department had previously stated that Elez was only granted “read-only” access to the payment system, although reporting by <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-associate-bfs-federal-payment-system/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Wired </u></a>and the financial newsletter <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/\"><u>Notes on the Crises</u></a> had questioned that assertion.</blockquote><p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jeffstein.bsky.social?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Jeff Stein for this citation</u></a> and all of his advice and support since January 31st as I first caught up to this issue and then jumped headfirst into breaking news myself.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Of course, as nice as it is to get deserved credit, the substance of this confirmation is also worth looking at closely. Normally I try to avoid big block quotes from court filings (okay, who am I kidding) but I think the full quote is important here. I’ve uploaded five court documents to my website for ease of access and posterity’s sake (find them linked together below). First up, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/34---Gioeli-affirmation.pdf\"><u>Joseph Gioeli III’s sworn affirmation</u></a>, who is “Deputy Commissioner of Transformation and Modernization” at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service:</p><blockquote>On the morning of February 6,<strong> it was discovered that Mr. Elez’s database access to SPS on February 5 had mistakenly been configured with read/write permissions instead of read-only</strong>. <strong>A forensic investigation was immediately initiated</strong> by database administrators to review all activities performed on that server and database. The initial investigation confirmed that all of Mr. Elez’s interactions with the SPS system occurred within the supervised, walk-through session and that no unauthorized actions had taken place. <strong>His access was promptly corrected to read-only, and he did not log into the system again after his initial virtual over-the-shoulder session on February 5</strong>. To the best of our knowledge, <strong>Mr. Elez never knew of the fact that he briefly had read/write permissions for the SPS database</strong>, and never took any action to exercise the “write” privileges in order to modify anything within the SPS database—indeed, <strong>he never logged in during the time that he had read/write privileges</strong>, other than during the virtual walk-through – and forensic analysis is currently underway to confirm this. [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>When I first read this paragraph, I laughed for about a minute straight in incredulity and disbelief.&nbsp;</p><p>What you are being asked to believe is that the most sensitive systems in the world, systems being scrutinized by much of the world for the first time, <strong>had “accidentally” been put under the full control of Marko Elez</strong>. You are also being asked to believe that this applied to only one system and the investigation launched was just to “make sure” nothing “bad” happened during this “accident”. And what do you know, they confirmed it! What is interesting about this story is it is perfectly shaped to fit the reporting from Wired and myself as much as possible while providing an innocuous explanation. This is roughly the equivalent of a student giving the excuse “I slipped on a banana peel and my dog ate my homework”. Apparently the Trump-Musk Treasury department has innovated in the field of slapstick comedy far beyond the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/by-the-sea-1915_202304\"><u>capacity of Charlie Chaplin to imagine</u></a>.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Its especially interesting that they are claiming that this only happened with SPS since, while <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>my sources</u></a> confirmed <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-associate-bfs-federal-payment-system/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Wired’s reporting</u></a> about Marko Elez’s access to the Secure Payment System (SPS) and the Payment Automation Manager (PAM), <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/treasury-secretary-bessents-lawlessness-sorry-readers-read-and-write-code-still-seems-in-play/\"><u>my subsequent reporting</u></a> confirmed evolutions of Marko Elez’s access to SPS but could not confirm evolutions of his access to other systems. This leaves two possibilities. The first is that the Treasury is shaping its answers to provide a rationale that is consistent with reporting from multiple sources but only to what they perceive is the extent necessary. These statements are their assessment of that, triangulating between Wired and my reporting.</p><p>The second is that they know only a small circle of very high level Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees could definitively know they are lying. Thus they either feel secure that these claims won’t be disconfirmed or their disconfirmation would facilitate finding an important security leak. These two different possibilities are obviously interrelated insofar as only confirming read/write access to SPS obliviates much of the power of lower level current Bureau of the Fiscal Service employees as sources (please still get in contact securely over Signal nevertheless). There is also the possibility that they expect counterclaims to have less force if they actually follow through on not having DOGE employees directly interact with these systems, even on a read only basis, anymore. More on this later.</p><p>These documents also confirm that Elez had direct access to source code and even that he was changing source code but only in a “sandbox” environment. Specifically, Gioeli states:</p><blockquote>Bureau provided Mr. Elez with the Bureau laptop and with copies of the source code for PAM, SPS, and ASAP in a separate, secure coding environment known as a “secure code repository” or “sandbox.” Mr. Elez could review and make changes locally to copies of the source code in the cordoned-off code repository; however, he did not have the authority or capability to publish any code changes to the production system or underlying test environments.</blockquote><p>Note that this is also a statement which provides an “innocuous” explanation for reporting last week, including Josh Marshall’s <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/musk-cronies-dive-into-treasury-dept-payments-code-base?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>early reporting at Talking Points Memo</u></a> of “source code changes” which neither Wired or I could confirm. This clearly appears to be an effort to tie all these issues up in a nice, tidy bow.</p><p>As I’ve made clear, I find the convenience of these explanations preposterous but I want to emphasize that aside from the fact that I stand by the accuracy of all my reporting, I do not have <strong>specific information at the time of writing to facilitate refuting Treasury’s new stories</strong>. I also want to emphasize what both Wired and I have explained in our reporting. “<strong>Read only” access is still “catastrophic” and it does not matter very much whether dangerous, and possibly unconstitutional, code is put into testing and production by a DOGE employee themselves or ordered by DOGE and implemented by career civil servants at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. </strong>Nor does modifying the payment system to implement unconstitutional directives at the operational level even necessarily require “read only” access.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXco4Hcb5_puJkCnQQdafFqmA70N6khz6bYiF8hVfkmCjCLO81PR8JgNPM_KHBH65CKVl5BwCI2gzP__rQ7oGn4EMwYtp893DO9HsPKyepKzHQAah7LtRqoIs5WnqsuhJpsGGzXf?key=MVdAqW88jhLSOeLwWiJ54uzO\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"289\"></figure><p>Which brings us to Thomas Krause’s <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/33---Krause-affirmation.pdf\"><u>sworn “affirmation”</u></a> yesterday. Recall that he is the Musk ally installed in a senior position and the only other person the initial injunction allowed “read only” access in addition to Marko Elez. His statement is not all that interesting regarding the facts about Marko Elez but it does provide some plausible and useful claims such as “Currently, I am the only Treasury DOGE team member.” and confirms the reporting that he will soon become “Fiscal Assistant Secretary” i.e. taking David Lebryk’s old position. There is also a key phrase in his affirmation which <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/33---Krause-affirmation.pdf\"><u>gives the whole game away</u></a>:</p><blockquote>(2) ensuring that the Treasury DOGE Team was leveraging its unique technological expertise to help operationalize the President’s policy priorities for the early days of the Administration, including by helping <strong>identify payments that may be improper under his new Executive Orders. &nbsp;</strong>[emphasis added]</blockquote><p>When I wrote my piece <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>published the morning of February 3rd</u></a> I was hoping that my rhetorical question about improper payments was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pldC0QW5GPc&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>ghoulish overkill</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Is “Wokeness,” the “Green New Deal,” “Marxism,” and “Gender Ideology” going to be the <strong>new definition of an “improper payment\"? </strong>[emphasis added]</blockquote><p>It turns out that I was dead on, unfortunately.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>To spell this out explicitly, the Krause statement is an admission, perhaps inadvertent, <strong>that they are pursuing using BFS systems to impound spending</strong> and they are going to rhetorically cover this by <strong>defining</strong> impounded spending as “improper payments”. As I <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>stated in that piece</u></a>, improper payments are in the eye of the beholder (in this situation).</p><p>Which brings us to the key question of making impoundment at the payments level <strong>operational</strong>. These documents have valuable details about their approach to building the technical machinery of impoundment. The downside is that we have to go through… details about the technical machinery of impoundment. Krause states:</p><blockquote>One initial goal of the engagement was to ensure that all payments through BFS’s payment systems included <strong>Treasury Account Symbols (TAS)</strong> and Business Event Type Codes (BETCs), which are used to identify what type of payment and accounts each payment request is associated with. These are the kinds of enhanced controls suggested in the March 30, 2023 GAO Report [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>This is a tricky area to discuss because unlike most of the nonsense coming out of the Trump administration on this issue, there is a real issue and legitimate purpose related to Krause’s statement. That is not particularly impressive nor does it validate DOGE’s activities, it is simply an indication of how outrageously otherworldly and maliciously false so much of the discourse about this issue has been.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>First, what are “Treasury Account Symbols”? The GAO report Krause invokes <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-104786?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>defines them as</u></a>:</p><blockquote>A TAS is a unique identification code that the Department of the Treasury, in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), assigns to a <strong>federal entity’s individual appropriation</strong>, receipt, or other fund account [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>A Business Event Type code, in turn, is just a code that identifies an activity related to that appropriation such as a disbursement or a collection. The key here is that if you can identify a specific appropriation by its TAS code, you can block the <strong>specific appropriations you do not like.</strong> This goes far beyond simply blocking payments from an entire agency which was my early concern which turned out to <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/treasury-secretary-bessents-lawlessness-sorry-readers-read-and-write-code-still-seems-in-play/\"><u>be entirely valid</u></a>.</p><p>It's important to understand that while Krause is telling the truth that ensuring all payments had TAS and BETC codes has been a regularly suggested improvement to internal controls and one that both the Bureau of the Fiscal Service itself, in addition to the GAO, has pursued, he is avoiding saying that he is looking to put them to an entirely new and dangerous purpose. The GAO report he invokes, for example, explicitly states that they are pursuing this internal control improvement to facilitate<a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-104786?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> identifying and closing</u></a>:</p><blockquote>TASs established during the annual fiscal year-end rollover process that do not subsequently have corresponding appropriations supporting the period of availability.</blockquote><p>In other words, this control was originally intended to ensure that agency spending is <strong>in line with</strong> congressional appropriations, not <strong>ignoring appropriations</strong> <strong>and unilaterally reducing agency spending below agency appropriations to suit their own ideological purposes</strong>. So while the internal control is legitimate, the purpose they are aiming to use it for is not. If you are an employee of the Government Accountability Office and would like to discuss my analysis, please contact me securely over signal (or email if you are comfortable with that).</p><p>Incidentally, Krause’s statements also confirm that Elon Musk was lying when he claimed that they do not check payments:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>In <strong>the normal course</strong>, when an agency initially provides a payment file to BFS through its PAM system, BFS conducts certain reviews of that file (known as “pre-edit”) before requesting that the agency certify the payment, after which point the file is processed through BFS’s systems. An example of a <strong>check that occurs during the pre-certification phase is to compare the payments in the file against the Do Not Pay working system, which is used to identify payments that may be improper or fraudulent</strong>. If transaction(s) in a payment file lead to a match when screened through the Do Not Pay working system, BFS notifies the submitting agency, which is <strong>given an opportunity to reexamine the payment file to determine whether to ultimately certify</strong> it for processing [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>Thus, the only sense in which Musk’s original tweet remains remotely true is that the payment is not outright “denied” but sent back to an agency for investigation and possible recertification. It may seem quant to continually fact check Musk tweets from two weeks ago but it's <strong>important to keep track of the shifting rationalizations and justifications</strong> to emphasize that the reasoning and claims are changing to accomplish the same goal:<strong> abrogating the constitution in service of centralizing power in the executive branch and subordinating both Congress and the Judiciary.</strong>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>In this iteration of these rationalizations, Krause attempts to present impoundment at the operational BFS level as a reasonable corollary to the “do not pay” checks that already happen.</p><blockquote>Our work to implement the President’s foreign aid Executive Order was intended to operate similarly. The plan we implemented included identifying payments files in the pre-edit phase, prior to certification and processing, that <strong>may fall within the scope of the Executive order and, thus, require review by the State Department</strong>, as the authorized agency under the Executive Order, to determine whether they fall within the scope of the Executive Order but should receive a waiver, or<strong> whether instead the payor agency should pause the payment pursuant to the Executive Order </strong>[emphasis added]</blockquote><p>This is, of course, sophistry. The operational process may be similar but <strong>the purpose is entirely different</strong>. Of course impoundment would operationally look similar to a “do not pay” check, they are looking to stop payments! But the purpose of the current “do not pay” system is to <strong>align</strong> agency disbursements with congressional appropriations and a “freeze spending” check is expressly intended to <strong>abrogate congressional appropriations</strong>. Hence why <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>Trump’s head of the OMB has put such emphasis</u></a> on the alleged illegality of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974!</p><p><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/28---Memorandum-Opinion-and-Order.pdf\"><u>02/11/25 <strong>Document 28</strong> “Memorandum Opinion and Order”</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/31---Wenzler-affirmation.pdf\"><u>02/11/25 <strong>Document </strong>31 “Wenzler Affirmation”</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/32---Robinson-affirmation.pdf\"><u>02/11/25 <strong>Document </strong>32 “Robinson Affirmation”</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/33---Krause-affirmation.pdf\"><u>02/11/25 <strong>Document </strong>33 “Krause Affirmation”</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/34---Gioeli-affirmation.pdf\"><u>02/11/25 <strong>Document </strong>34 “Gioeli Affirmation”</u></a></p><p>Which brings me to Vona S. Robinson’s affirmation (for completeness and ease of perusal, I’m linking all the files above together above, including a couple of files I do not discuss in this piece). Robinson provides a lot more details which affirm and intensify the reasons to be concerned about Krause’s testimony above. She also provides clear details in general. In fact, I’m going to quote her description of how the Bureau of the Fiscal Service traditionally processes payments simply because it’s worth reading to better understand what we have been talking about the last two weeks:</p><blockquote>Within PAM, PAM’s “file system” <strong>receives payment files from payor agencies into its “landing zone,”</strong> which is the existing system that ingests payment files before agencies certify the payments for processing. When payment files come into the “landing zone,” they are transferred to the <strong>PAM application where the payment file is validated and a preedit report is generated and sent back to the Federal Agency that contains, among other things, information about potentially improper or fraudulent payments.</strong> The Federal Agency uses this report to certify the payments in the SPS system, after which the payments are processed consistent with the instructions within the file.</blockquote><p>This again affirms the falsity of Musk’s earlier claims. I’ll get to assessing Musk’s recent tweets in the context of these court affirmations tomorrow… unless more news breaks.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Crucially, Robinson’s statement provides confirmation to <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/treasury-secretary-bessents-lawlessness-sorry-readers-read-and-write-code-still-seems-in-play/\"><u>CNN’s bombshell reporting</u></a> about payment level impoundment regarding USAID. It also adds new alarming details about just how far payment level impoundment has gotten. As far as I’m aware, as of publication I’m the first source to cover these disturbing revelations. Specifically, they have already moved beyond a stop payment process for <strong>agencies</strong> to stopping payment at the <strong>Treasury Account Code (TAS) level</strong>:</p><blockquote>On January 31, the Bureau was directed to (1) identify incoming specific Agency payment files to the “landing zone” that met 4 specified Treasury Account Symbol (TAS) codes,—<strong>I understand that those TAS codes had been associated with categories of payments that were not USAID payments, but which nonetheless may have been covered under the foreign aid Executive Order</strong>; (2) create a copy of the payment files with those TAS codes—the <strong>original payment files would remain in the landing zone to ensure payment integrity;</strong> (3) move those copies into a <strong>separate folder (the “MoveIT” folder) where they could be sent to authorized officials at the State Department for review;</strong> (4) deliver the copies to authorized staff at the State Department through a secure portal that was limited in access to certain designated Department of State officials, <strong>for same-day review,</strong> and (5) allow those State Department officials to <strong>determine whether the Executive Order required a pause, or whether the original payment files should move forward into PAM’s processing system for disbursement according to Treasury’s normal payment processes. </strong>[emphasis added]</blockquote><p>Let's break this down.&nbsp;</p><p>What Vona Robinson is saying is that the Trump administration has already reached beyond stopping payments from agencies they do not like to stopping <strong>specific appropriations</strong> they do not like regardless of the agency doing the spending. In the examples she describes a flagged payment file is left in the processing stage but a copy is produced, placed in a different folder and that folder’s contents can be sent to an administrative agency using a “secure portal”. That folder which leads to files being sent to an agency is called the “MoveIT” folder. What the officials at the agency are “supposed to be” doing according to the Trump administration is reviewing them for “violations” of the president’s executive orders which unconstitutionally order sweeping spending freezes. Thus, <strong>this process is operationally elevating executive orders above all other laws.</strong></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>What non-USAID appropriations were flagged? You might think that they were non-USAID, state department expenditures because of Robinson’s description above. This is perhaps the most disturbing part: <strong>they were not</strong>:</p><blockquote>One TAS code was associated with the Millenium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and<strong> three TAS codes were associated with certain payments from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</strong>. These included two sub-accounts labeled <strong>“Refugee and Entrant Assistance, Admin for Children and Families,” one account labeled “Gifts and Donations Office of Refugee Resettlement, Admin for Children and Families,” and one account labeled “Refugee Resettlement Assistance, Administration for Children and Families, Health and Human Services.”</strong>&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Besides the despicable nature of pursuing freezing the spending they were flagging, this affirmation essentially communicates that a government agency, a cabinet level one no less, <strong>was not involved in the review process of its own appropriations. </strong>This is much worse than anything that had previously been in the public domain. The fact that these are international payments and in some general sense “state department related” does not make them automatically subject to State department review (at least as far as I’m aware. If there is any statutory basis for State department review, please let me know and I will correct my error). </p><p>Of course, reviewing payment files manually is a high effort process and will not scale to the extent that DOGE and the Trump administration desire. This is why Robinson’s statements about manual review are crucial. Specifically:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>At the outset, I understand that BFS career staff queried the PAM file system manually to identify payment files and <strong>shared those payment files with Mr. Elez for review through the MoveIT folder. I further understand that, at some point after January 31, Mr. Elez assisted in automating the manual review of the payment files. </strong>[emphasis added]</blockquote><p>It is unclear whether this \"automation\" of the \"manual review\" was a source code change or an API overlay. Based on discussions with programmers unfamiliar with the situation, who also reference public reporting about the quality of programming skills DOGE employees seem to have had, it is commonly believed that what was constructed was an API overlay. Nevertheless, clarity is needed on this point and an independent investigation into the issue of source code changes. This also means that Marko Elez was directly involved in writing code to automate operationally and unconstitutionally impounding appropriations.</p><p>Robinson finishes her affirmation saying that the “State Department review process” has been frozen and that the BFS has not impounded spending “certified” by agencies:</p><blockquote>As of February 10, we have ensured that the State Department review process will not proceed for payment requests within the scope of the TRO order issued in New York v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-39-JJM-PAS (D.R.I.)</blockquote><blockquote>To the best of my knowledge, BFS has not failed to disburse any payment duly certified by a payor agency as a result of the Treasury DOGE Team’s work. To date, no payments, with the exception of the single MCC payment mentioned above, have been delayed or canceled by the payor agency as a result of the re-routing and review process described herein.</blockquote><p>This is not particularly comforting.</p><p>The Trump administration may currently claim that they were not “freezing” spending without the agency’s approval before the temporary restraining order but, first of all, “freezing” i.e. impounding spending <strong>is still unconstitutional whether it's done at the agency level or at the payments level</strong>. Second of all, and most importantly, the operational capacity to freeze payments is a coercive tool which creates pressure on agencies to comply with illegal presidential executive orders (or illegal interpretations of those executive orders). The obvious fear is<strong> that non-compliance will lead to a worse freezing of payments</strong> and leave payment freezes to the <strong>sole discretion of whoever in the Treasury</strong> will be making these kinds of decisions in the future on DOGE’s behalf. All my fears from two weeks ago about DOGE reaching <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>into the “payments heart”</u></a> and short circuiting the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>“bureaucratic trench warfare” opened up by agencies</u></a> choosing to follow court orders <strong>are coming true.</strong></p><p>What is the take away from all this? It appears that <strong>we may have avoided the worst case scenarios of system failure and Marko Elez breaking a system he does not understand</strong>. This is important and valuable. We truly were in a potentially apocalyptic scenario last week. My inclination is to believe that they are not going to have one of the 20 something DOGE employees mess around with these extraordinarily sensitive systems (if you are a BFS employee who knows facts to the contrary, please get into contact securely over signal). However, my inclination to believe we’ve avoided the worst case scenarios is based on my informed intuition that the <strong>leadership in this area, including Musk, are laser focused on impoundment</strong>. Thus the constitutional crisis has still intensified from my first article on January 31st.&nbsp;</p><p>My lack of fear or panic right now is simply based on how fearful I was of the very real threat of total system breakdown. But <strong>we are in a, say, 7 alarm constitutional crisis</strong>. The focus on data privacy stemmed the bleeding but the Attorney Generals involved with this suit, or some other entities, need to figure out an effective lawsuit over the constitutional issue at hand. Every issue will be affected so every group which is opposed to an unconstitutional and fully imperial, unchecked presidency needs to be laser focused on this issue and form large coalitions to oppose it.</p><p><em><strong>Corrections 3:30 PM:</strong> This article has been updated to clarify that source code changes are not necessary to automate a flagging of payment files for Agency (or other)

There is nothing disastrous about it. I’m sending out this newsletter today to make sure that the people looking for some good news (at least by the standards of the day) can get some now. Our story begins right after we left off: with Marko Elez, the DOGE employee I relentlessly tracked through the bowels of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service using my anonymous sources in my last five pieces, resigning within an hour of my last piece. His resignation was a gigantic relief for me and allowed me to unwind an enormous amount of stress I had built up over the past week. If you listen to my interviews at either the Majority Report, Lever News, Bloomberg’s Odd Lots or radio KPFA last week, I think the stress I felt and the enormous burden that weighed on me is clear even as I was professional and kept to the facts as much as possible.\n\nSubsequent surreal news emerged on this subject (a point I’ll return to), but I was able to keep on resting and the news developed in such a way as to facilitate keeping away from work this weekend. I scrambled to raise the alarm about this issue at the beginning of last week and was successful at doing so while reinforcing my analysis with cutting edge investigative reporting. \n\nThe best I could do on Thursday was update people by updating “Afternoon of Day Seven of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025: Treasury Secretary Bessent’s Lawlessness & Sorry Readers- Read and Write Code Still Seems in Play” with this brief message at the top:\n\nUPDATE 4:21 PM: MARKO ELEZ HAS RESIGNED. WALL STREET JOURNAL CLAIMS IT WAS OVER \"RACIST POSTS\". OBVIOUSLY NOT TRUE- WIRED, TALKING POINTS MEMO AND I GOT HIM. NEED TO REST, MORE TOMORROW\n\nI, of course, did not end up doing a piece on Friday. So let’s unpack my E-telegram here and what I mean. \n\nAt 3:53 PM on Thursday, February 6th the Wall Street Journal published an article by Katherine Long entitled “DOGE Staffer Resigns Over Racist Posts”. Obviously this announcement was met with celebration from me and others, including statements from me about having “gotten” him. This caused confusion with some on social media even crediting me with Katherine Long’s investigative efforts. To be absolutely clear: I did not nor did I ever claim to have found archived racist posts from Marko Elez. What I meant was something entirely different.\n\nIt is very common in business and governmental circles for someone to be fired or “resign” after getting into trouble. It is especially common for the stated reason given to not be the actual reason. This means divining what is actually happening requires a critical and skeptical eye to such news reports. Ask yourself this question: is it believable that the second Trump administration is pushing out employees for racist posts, let alone almost as soon as those racist posts come to light? Recall that Long’s article states “After the Journal inquired about the account, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that Elez had resigned from his role.” Does this pass the “smell test” as a plausible reason for you?\n\nIt is far more likely, though can’t be confirmed as a fact at this stage, that the increasing public pressure based on Wired, Talking Points Memo and my reporting (as well as likely increasing private pressure from former government officials and financial and corporate figures) converged with the reporter getting in touch and created a convenient cover story for Marko Elez’s resignation. Recall that his resignation was official as of sometime Thursday Afternoon which is only 1.5 working days after the release of my Bloomberg Oddlots interview, the first business outlet that truly dramatized the stakes. In governmental terms, that is a split second. Marko Elez was also the subject of a court injunction that very morning which was bad press even if there were potentially dramatic loopholes in that may have even allowed Marco Elez to continue having “read and write” access to source code.\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine that the Op Ed out today by Robert Rubin, Lawrence Summers, Timothy Geithner, Jacob Lew and Janet Yellen “Five Former Treasury Secretaries: Our Democracy Is Under Siege” reflects more varied and heterogeneous efforts last week to intervene in treasury secretary Bessent’s reckless support of DOGE’s despoiling of the Treasury’s payments system. I will also say that their emphasis on the constitutional question involved, something I was extremely early to, seems to betray a familiarity with my work. I also have independent reason to believe this was the case which I cannot divulge.\n\nIn any case, the timing is just too perfect for it to be coincidental. I will admit my immediate reaction the day of was skepticism towards the timing of Katherine Long’s inquiries about those racist tweets. However, it appears that her inquiries were simply fortuitous timing for the Trump administration, and perhaps slightly sped up something that was already in process. In fact, this is something that is actually very useful about the young programmers Elon Musk has hired at DOGE. There is very little doubt that all, or almost all, of these employees have social media histories similar to Marko Elez. This makes it easy to dispose of them while causing confusion about why exactly one of them is being fired, protecting the destructive work they were undertaking. \n\nThen, of course, things got stranger. Elon Musk posted a poll Saturday morning about whether Marko Elez should be “brought back”. A couple of hours later Vice President Vance quote tweeted Musk saying “bring him back”. Musk then quote tweeted Vance’s tweets at 3:13 PM on Friday saying \"He will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine\". The confirmation, however, came when Trump was asked about it at a press conference and said \"Well, I don't know about the particular thing, but if the vice president said that, did you say that? [Vance confirms] I'm with the vice president.\" There is the part of the Trump administration that makes decisions (seemingly led by chief of Staff Susie Wiles) and then there is the part of the Trump administration that makes posts and turns those into decisions. The first part is likely who pushed Marko Elez to resign. The second part is what brought him back.\n\nIt was, however, unclear whether being “rehired” meant back at the United States Treasury. This was crucial because the Thursday injunction only allowed Marko Elez and Thomas Krause “read only’ access, barring any other “special government employees” or outside actors from access to these systems. Further, according to my sources, Krause was not involved in the direct assessment of these systems so with Marko out, it seems that DOGE would be locked out (under, of course, the crucial assumption that they respect the court injunction). The Treasury dodged questions about whether Marko Elez would be rejoining them. These questions became moot early Saturday morning, but we’ll return to that in a moment.\n\nA crucial question is this: when Elez left, how was his activities in the Bureau of the Fiscal Service being treated? I can’t speak to the state of play as of today. However, I can confirm Wired's Friday afternoon article entitled “A US Treasury Threat Intelligence Analysis Designates DOGE Staff as ‘Insider Threat’”. In fact, I posted on bluesky (since I wanted to keep on resting) the confirmation from one of my sources:\n\nBFS is treating Marko's resignation as a cybersecurity breach. The cyber teams are working overtime to analyze the forensic artifacts Marko left behind and determine what he saw/did.\n\nIt is absolutely extraordinary that an employee given top level access, as ordered by the White House, was being treated this way. \n\nSubscribe\n\nAs of this writing it's unclear how long this lasted or whether treating this as a cybersecurity breach was continued informally even as White House and Treasury Secretary Bessent’s pressure intensified. I would like to put off writing about this more until tomorrow for a number of reasons, not least of which we may gain more clarity by the time I sit down to write about it then.\n\nWhat are my sources saying now? I will be unpacking a lot of  the “state of play” with my former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee sources but my current BFS sources have gone dark. It should be obvious that what they did was risky to their careers and even lives. They had far more on the line than I did and they will never get a fraction of the praise that they deserve. Nor will they get the career benefits I have from being involved in last week’s enormous effort. \n\nI have no way to get back in touch with them of my own volition and the only messages I received from them saved in any form are the ones I got full approval to quote on the record. I do not know my sources names- I corroborated that they worked at BFS in alternative, undisclosed ways- and cannot facilitate their identification even if I wanted to. They will get back in touch if it's safe to do so but if they never do: thank you. I did my best to thank them as much as possible while we talked but nothing can substitute for the flood of gratitude I’ve gotten. \n\nWhich brings me to the final topic I have to tackle today: the latest court injunction. Nineteen state Attorney Generals collectively sued the Trump administration and the Treasury over the Treasury’s treatment of safe and secure data on Sunday night, in a lawsuit now known as “New York et al. v. Trump et al.” I’m proud to say that this lawsuit cites Notes on the Crises. Not only does the lawsuit cite this newsletter, it cites it in an important way:\n\nThe Treasury has represented that DOGE associates have “read only” access— i.e., the ability to view content, but not the ability to modify it. But the true limitations on DOGE’s access remain unclear, and DOGE may still be able to modify the systems in consequential ways [emphasis added]\n\nThe footnote that follows “consequential ways” cites “Day Seven of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025: ‘Yours and WIRED's Reporting is Actually Doing Something’”. Given the importance of this issue I’m especially happy that my writing got cited on such a crucial point.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAt 1 Am Saturday, February 8th, Judge Engelmayer issued an injunction based on the State AG’s lawsuits:\n\nThe Court’s firm assessment is that, for the reasons stated by the States, they will face irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief. See Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking\n\nThe injunction further orders \n\n(i) restrained from granting access to any Treasury Department payment record, payment systems, or any other data systems maintained by the Treasury Department containing personally identifiable information and/or confidential financial information of payees, other than to civil servants with a need for access to perform their job duties within the Bureau of Fiscal Services who have passed all background checks and security clearances and taken all information security training called for in federal statutes and Treasury Department regulations; (ii) restrained from granting access to all political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department, to any Treasury Department payment record, payment systems, or any other data systems maintained by the Treasury Department containing personally identifiable information and/or confidential financial information of payees; and (iii) ordered to direct any person prohibited above from having access to such information, records and systems but who has had access to such information, records, and systems since January 20, 2025, to immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded from the Treasury Department’s records and systems, if any\n\nThus, this injunction is far more comprehensive than Thursday’s injunction. It does not have the “wiggle room” that that injunction has and the Attorney General offices involved seem to have been focused on the difficulty of trying to enforce “middle ground” injunctions like “read only access”. I’m biased of course, but clearly my newsletter contributed something to their effort since they cited it on this very point. I’m sure I’ll be writing a lot more about this injunction in the future and the question of its enforcement. If you have factual information regarding whether this injunction is being violated, please get in contact over Signal (information above).\n\nPart of why this piece took me so long to write today was that there was just so much to cover. In fact, too much. Tomorrow I’ll write about Bessent’s very strange Bloomberg interview last Thursday, The Treasury’s response to the early Saturday court injunction, Musk’s tweeted plans for the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the Booz Allen contractor Treasury fired over his analysis of the Marko-created cybersecurity risks and the so called “black budget” which is apparently processed by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.

Recall that Long’s article states “After the Journal inquired about the account, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that Elez had resigned from his role.” Does this pass the “smell test” as a plausible reason for you?</p><p>It is <strong>far more likely</strong>, though can’t be confirmed as a fact at this stage, that the increasing public pressure based on Wired, Talking Points Memo and my reporting (as well as likely increasing private pressure from former government officials and financial and corporate figures) converged with the reporter getting in touch and created a convenient cover story for Marko Elez’s resignation. Recall that his resignation was official as of sometime Thursday Afternoon which is only 1.5 working days after the release of my Bloomberg Oddlots interview, the first business outlet that truly dramatized the stakes. In governmental terms, that is a split second. Marko Elez was also the subject of a court injunction that very morning which was bad press even if there were potentially dramatic loopholes in that may have even allowed Marco Elez to continue having <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/treasury-secretary-bessents-lawlessness-sorry-readers-read-and-write-code-still-seems-in-play/\"><u>“read and write” access to source code</u></a>.</p><p>It’s not hard to imagine that the Op Ed out today by Robert Rubin, Lawrence Summers, Timothy Geithner, Jacob Lew and Janet Yellen <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/opinion/treasure-secretaries-doge-musk.html?unlocked_article_code=1.v04.cttd.fDMgcErpM5eh&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“Five Former Treasury Secretaries: Our Democracy Is Under Siege”</u></a> reflects more varied and heterogeneous efforts last week to intervene in treasury secretary Bessent’s reckless support of DOGE’s despoiling of the Treasury’s payments system. I will also say that their emphasis on the constitutional question involved, something I was <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>extremely early to</u></a>, seems to betray a familiarity with my work. I also have independent reason to believe this was the case which I cannot divulge.</p><p>In any case, <strong>the timing is just too perfect</strong> for it to be coincidental. I will <strong>admit my immediate reaction the day of</strong> was skepticism towards the timing of Katherine Long’s inquiries about those racist tweets. However, it appears that her inquiries <strong>were simply fortuitous timing for the Trump administration</strong>, and perhaps slightly sped up something that was already in process. In fact, this is something that is actually very useful about the young programmers Elon Musk has hired at DOGE. There is very little doubt that all, or almost all, of these employees have social media histories similar to Marko Elez. This makes it<strong> easy to dispose of them while causing confusion</strong> about why exactly one of them is being fired, protecting the destructive work they were undertaking.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, of course, <strong>things got stranger</strong>. Elon Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1887867644814020902?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>posted a poll Saturday morning</u></a> about whether Marko Elez should be “brought back”. A couple of hours later Vice President Vance <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/1887900880143343633?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>quote tweeted Musk saying</u></a> “bring him back”. Musk then quote tweeted Vance’s tweets <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1887957783783391423?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>at 3:13 PM on Friday saying</u></a> \"He will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine\". The confirmation, however, came when Trump was asked about it at a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP4dbsmsM-s&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>press conference and said</u></a> \"Well, I don't know about the particular thing, but if the vice president said that, did you say that? [Vance confirms] I'm with the vice president.\" There is the part of the Trump administration that makes decisions (seemingly led by chief of Staff Susie Wiles) and then there is <strong>the part of the Trump administration that makes posts and turns those into decisions</strong>. The first part is likely who pushed Marko Elez to resign. The second part is what brought him back.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfDAlLNqGO3QN40MDAYgF-YCpQrk8Y3z0vonUVScDZM1qXWp7fpqM_ozxmYyyI1_gS6cqXRkv3hjA_1SDPe8VkqrVGG_9Pw-aTObP41dsN8kUAzdutJwzN0UHPtT5Dw3SVBRgpa?key=ngKVo07aZ3K2hVgrfq_KzEse\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"533\" height=\"335\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcQCQ2zE3D9klKaV-MGCVk7ZpIDrGCqahI2BjW_urm1yild25sdnggXlPrMeItH1vmZz0EoolDR90H6SpbhMYe9sxfe9r_12vqlRyU6_vWyaB470_6e1zPQotaoL_glePrtxoX5hw?key=ngKVo07aZ3K2hVgrfq_KzEse\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"483\" height=\"504\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXezr3kP_TyWO7GLckFcnxUAeXzcWsVdn3UR9WUShYyChRXb67MzbnKGYxItXVumz4ErvUC-aVY_eqSJ_eY30kjk47myPjtV2CmUw4XNA4OH5I8xfzcEo1HZmpCPEJHuXLXyrrjg?key=ngKVo07aZ3K2hVgrfq_KzEse\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"475\" height=\"406\"></figure><p>It was, however, unclear whether being “rehired” meant back at the United States Treasury. This was crucial because the Thursday injunction only allowed Marko Elez and Thomas Krause “read only’ access, barring any other “special government employees” or outside actors from access to these systems. Further, according to my sources, Krause was not involved in the direct assessment of these systems so with Marko out, it seems that DOGE would be locked out (under, of course, the crucial assumption that they respect the court injunction). The Treasury dodged questions about whether Marko Elez would be rejoining them. These questions became moot early Saturday morning, but we’ll return to that in a moment.</p><p>A crucial question is this: when Elez left, how was his activities in the Bureau of the Fiscal Service being treated? I can’t speak to the state of play as of today. However,<strong> I can confirm Wired's Friday </strong><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/treasury-bfs-doge-insider-threat/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u><strong>afternoon article</strong> entitled</u></a> “A US Treasury Threat Intelligence Analysis Designates DOGE Staff as ‘Insider Threat’”. In fact, I posted on bluesky (since I wanted to keep on resting) the confirmation from <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/nathantankus.bsky.social/post/3lhmgnmmb422p?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>one of my sources</u></a>:</p><blockquote>BFS is treating Marko's resignation as a cybersecurity breach. The cyber teams are working overtime to analyze the forensic artifacts Marko left behind and determine what he saw/did.</blockquote><p>It is absolutely extraordinary that an employee given top level access, as ordered by the White House, was being treated this way.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>As of this writing it's unclear how long this lasted or whether treating this as a cybersecurity breach was continued informally even as White House and Treasury Secretary Bessent’s pressure intensified. I would like to put off writing about this more until tomorrow for a number of reasons, not least of which we may gain more clarity by the time I sit down to write about it then.</p><p>What are my sources saying now? I will be unpacking a lot of&nbsp; the “state of play” with my former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee sources but<strong> my current BFS sources have gone dark</strong>. It should be obvious that what they did was risky to their careers and <strong>even lives</strong>. They had far more on the line than I did and they will never get a fraction of the praise that they deserve. Nor will they get the career benefits I have from being involved in last week’s enormous effort.&nbsp;</p><p>I have no way to get back in touch with them of my own volition and the only messages I received from them saved in any form are the ones I got full approval to quote on the record. I do not know my sources names- I corroborated that they worked at BFS in alternative, undisclosed ways- and cannot facilitate their identification even if I wanted to. They will get back in touch <strong>if it's safe to do so but if they never do: thank you</strong>. I did my best to thank them as much as possible while we talked but nothing can substitute for the flood of gratitude I’ve gotten.&nbsp;</p><p>Which brings me to the final topic I have to tackle today: the latest court injunction. Nineteen state Attorney Generals <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/new-york-v-trump-doge-treasury-feb-7-2025.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>collectively sued the Trump administration and the Treasury</u></a> over the Treasury’s treatment of safe and secure data on Sunday night, in a lawsuit now known as <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/new-york-v-trump-doge-treasury-feb-7-2025.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“New York et al. v. Trump et al.”</u></a> I’m proud to say that this lawsuit cites <strong><em>Notes on the Crises</em></strong>. Not only does the lawsuit cite this newsletter, it cites it in an important way:</p><blockquote>The Treasury has represented that DOGE associates have “read only” access— i.e., the ability to view content, but not the ability to modify it. But the true limitations on DOGE’s access<strong> remain unclear</strong>, and DOGE may still be able to modify the systems in <strong>consequential ways </strong>[emphasis added]</blockquote><p>The footnote that follows “consequential ways” cites <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-seven-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-yours-and-wireds-reporting-is-actually-doing-something/\"><u>“Day Seven of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025: ‘Yours and WIRED's Reporting is Actually Doing Something’”</u></a>.

That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the <strong>disclosure of sensitive and confidential information</strong> and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be <strong>more vulnerable than before to hacking</strong></blockquote><p>The injunction <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/state-of-new-york-et-al-v-trump-et-al-order-2025.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>further orders</u></a>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><strong>(i) restrained from granting access to any Treasury Department payment record, payment systems, or any other data systems maintained by the Treasury Department</strong> containing personally identifiable information and/or confidential financial information of payees, other than to civil servants with a need for access to perform their job duties within the Bureau of Fiscal Services who have passed all background checks and security clearances and taken all information security training called for in federal statutes and Treasury Department regulations; <strong>(ii) restrained from granting access to all political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department, to any Treasury Department payment record, payment systems, or any other data systems maintained by the Treasury Department containing personally identifiable information and/or confidential financial information of payees</strong>; and (iii) ordered to direct any person prohibited above from having access to such information, records and systems but who has had access to such information, records, and systems since January 20, 2025, to <strong>immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded from the Treasury Department’s records and systems, if any</strong></blockquote><p>Thus, this injunction is far more comprehensive than Thursday’s injunction. It does not have the “wiggle room” that that injunction has and the Attorney General offices involved seem to have been focused on the difficulty of trying to enforce “middle ground” injunctions like “read only access”. I’m biased of course, but clearly my newsletter contributed something to their effort since they cited it on this very point. I’m sure I’ll be writing a lot more about this injunction in the future and the question of its enforcement. If you have <strong>factual information regarding whether this injunction is being violated</strong>, please get in contact over Signal (information above).</p><p>Part of why this piece took me so long to write today was that there was just so much to cover. In fact, too much. Tomorrow I’ll write about Bessent’s very strange Bloomberg interview last Thursday, The Treasury’s response to the early Saturday court injunction, Musk’s tweeted plans for the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the Booz Allen contractor Treasury fired over his analysis of the Marko-created cybersecurity risks and the so called “black budget” which is apparently processed by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.

The additional thing you get is me trying to stop the Treasury’s internal payment system from melting down or Musk taking your confidential information, along with everyone else's. So far, nowhere near enough rich people are paying their fair share.\n\nNote to Readers: I am on bluesky, an alternative to twitter. It's been hard to let go of twitter since that is where I built my following, but clearly it's becoming less usable and there are obvious concerns about getting traction about a Musk story on the Everything Musk app. I have also started an instagram for Notes on the Crises which is currently being populated with my articles.\n\nFinally, I'm known as a crypto skeptic, and I am, but that doesn't mean I won't accept people giving away bitcoin to me. Here's my address: bc1qegxarzsfga9ycesfa7wm77sqmuqqv7083c6ss6\n\nThrough my reporting it has become clear that “read and write” and “read only” are phrases that are being used in many conflicting ways and that the Trump Administration, DOGE and Elon Musk are using this to their advantage. There is “read and write code access” and “read and write data access”. The differences are essential and it is essential that any injunction for “read only” access, at the very least, apply to both data and code.\n\nThis also connects to my reporting this morning. I had very little time to write up the story and get full approval from my sources (who always have full approval since they are the ones at risk) which meant I had very limited time to get advice from experts (or frankly, to take a breath and do some “slow” thinking). Having spoken to a number of sources unfamiliar with the situation since my reporting came out, it is now clear that my sources do not yet have information on whether or not Marko Elez can change code in these highly sensitive systems. “Insert only” permissions only apply to database access and tell us nothing about code access.\n\nThis clarification comes as the text of the Court Order (based on agreement between the parties lawyers) brings reason to think that the text leads to a potential loophole to “read only” access which Treasury will, or is, exploit to give Marko Elez read and write code access. Thus my sources are aligning with the cynical reading of the court order. The ability to read and write code is of course the central disaster the newsletter has been focused on, and frankly the horror of the idea that Marko Elez would or did have “read and write” access for data has not fully been a part of my thinking or alarm (except as a “hacking” situation). \n\nSo what’s the issue? The wording of the court order for Marko Elez to have “read only” access is ambiguous. Specifically it says:\n\nMr. Marko Elez, a Special Government Employee in the Department of the Treasury, as needed for the performance of his duties, provided that such access to payment records will be \"read only\" [emphasis added]\n\nRecords are data which means that a cynical government lawyer may approve “read and write” access for code on the grounds that Marko Elez is only barred from modifying or adding new data to payment records directly rather than indirectly through editing source code. The plaintiffs position would of course, correctly, claim that “read and write code access” is a violation of this order as written. Nevertheless, the possibility is extremely concerning. And remember- “read only code and data” access is still “catastrophic”\n\nSubscribe\n\nAll this comes as CNN and other outlets confirm that some of the worst case scenarios I was worried about are true. The truly bizarre and shocking story confirms Talking Points Memo reporting regarding already putting code into production to stop payments (Tech Dirt had a very good discussion based on Wired’s and TPM’s reporting). However, it goes well beyond that. The entire story is worth a full and complete read but I will quote the a sampling of extremely alarming statements:\n\nFour days after Donald Trump’s inauguration, Elon Musk’s top lieutenants at the Treasury Department asked its acting secretary, a career civil servant, to immediately shut off all USAID payments using the department’s own ultra-sensitive payment processing system. [...]\n\n“What we would like to do is, to the extent permitted by law, temporarily pause the automatic processing of payment files,” from a USAID division called Health Systems Strengthening, [Treasury Chief of Staff] Katz wrote.\n\nKatz also wrote that Krause, Musk’s deputy at Treasury, should be given access to the payments system so he and his team could take action.\n\nSome of the administration’s plan, Katz added, included immediately pausing all payment files still in the queue and letting Krause and others look at individual payments certified by USAID for the health care systems. The State Department could then look closer at the payments through USAID, Katz added. [...]\n\n“There are also practical and personal liability issues that may come into play,” Lebryk wrote, copying a lawyer from the Treasury Department’s general counsel’s office.\n\nBut Krause, the special hire from DOGE sent to Treasury, was undeterred. “I would also recommend you consider an equal alternative liability,” he wrote to Lebryk. [...]\n\nInitially, Bessent didn’t give Krause and DOGE any limitation on its access to the system, which Lebryk opposed, according to a source familiar with the exchange. [Emphasis Added]\n\nThis is among the worst case scenarios I wrote about on Monday (including in Rolling Stone) outside of total system meltdown. \n\nAs I said on Monday:\n\nThis is the absolutely crucial part. Without political control of the payment's heart, the Trump administration and Elon Musk must chase down every agency and bend it to their will. They are in the process of doing that, but bureaucrats can notionally continue to respect the law and resist their efforts. They are helped in this effort by court injunctions they can point to. This is bureaucratic trench warfare. But if Musk and Trump can reach into the choke point, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, they could possibly not need agency cooperation. They can just impound agency payments themselves. They could also possibly stop paying federal employees they have forced on paid administrative leave, coercing them to resign. These possibilities are what every Treasury expert I’ve talked to instantly thought of the moment they read the Washington Post reporting and are incredibly alarmed about.\n\nI have never felt worse about being completely right in my entire life. If anything, I have not been striking a dire enough tone.\n\nEvery single person involved in this, from Secretary Bessent to Chief of Staff Dan Katz needs to be removed from the Treasury, not just Krause and Marko Elez. This all also adds credibility to what I reported from two anonymous sources on Monday:\n\nI can exclusively report here for the first time that Scott Bessent was advised that what Donald Trump wanted in a Treasury Secretary was a person who would have the credibility Steve Mnuchin had with Wall Street but who would be loyal to Trump above all other considerations, according to two sources familiar with the situation. This included, but was not limited to, unconditionally agreeing to work with whomever Trump sent over to the Treasury Department and helping go after Donald Trump’s enemies.\n\nNo outlet has even mentioned that I reported this because of how explosive it is. They will only mention my reporting if they receive independent corroboration. I hope they do.

Here's my address: </em>bc1qegxarzsfga9ycesfa7wm77sqmuqqv7083c6ss6</p><p>Through my reporting it has become clear that “read and write” and “read only” are phrases that are being used in many conflicting ways and that the Trump Administration, DOGE and Elon Musk are using this to their advantage. There is “read and write code access” and “read and write data access”. The differences are essential and it is essential that any injunction for “read only” access, at the very least, apply to both data and code.</p><p>This also connects to my reporting this morning. I had very little time to write up the story and get full approval from my sources (who always have full approval since they are the ones at risk) which meant I had very limited time to get advice from experts (or frankly, to take a breath and do some “slow” thinking). Having spoken to a number of sources unfamiliar with the situation since my reporting came out, it is now clear that my sources do not yet have information on whether or not Marko Elez can change code in these highly sensitive systems. “Insert only” permissions only apply to database access and tell us nothing about code access.</p><p>This clarification comes as the text of the Court Order (based on agreement between the parties lawyers) brings reason to think that the text leads to a potential loophole to “read only” access which Treasury will, <strong>or is</strong>, exploit to give Marko Elez read and write <strong>code access</strong>. Thus my sources are aligning with the cynical reading of the court order. The ability to read and write code is of course the central disaster the newsletter has been focused on, and frankly the horror of the idea that Marko Elez would or did have “read and write” access for <strong>data</strong> has not fully been a part of my thinking or alarm (except as a “hacking” situation).&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeIq_ce_PUMu9LVwyvrWF4XuRtNEcH5cwOKTyvDzfvFSnp89gVw_bDq0eZUdchZBBuRCcPdhd62QIrnimcITOUHs8ME6QBaOiKDlqfub0bjyMPT0PRoMrnwiL-PVXvOQfqiplrn?key=XyC64LEPo_d2BlsCgkMLpNSn\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"430\" height=\"868\"></figure><p>So what’s the issue? The wording of the court order for Marko Elez to have “read only” access is ambiguous. Specifically it says:</p><blockquote>Mr. Marko Elez, a Special Government Employee in the Department of the Treasury, as needed for the performance of his duties, provided that such <strong>access to payment records will be \"read only\" </strong>[emphasis added]</blockquote><p>Records are data which means that a cynical government lawyer may approve “read and write” access for code on the grounds that Marko Elez is only barred from modifying or adding new data to payment records directly rather than indirectly through editing source code. The plaintiffs position would of course, correctly, claim that “read and write code access” is a violation of this order as written. Nevertheless, the possibility is extremely concerning. And remember- “read only code and data” access is still “catastrophic”</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>All this comes as CNN and other outlets confirm that some of the worst case scenarios I was worried about <strong>are true</strong>. The truly bizarre and shocking story confirms <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/musk-cronies-dive-into-treasury-dept-payments-code-base?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Talking Points Memo reporting</u></a> regarding already <strong>putting code into production to stop payments</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2025/02/05/a-25-year-old-is-writing-backdoors-into-the-treasurys-6-trillion-payment-system-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Tech Dirt had</u></a> a very good discussion based on Wired’s and TPM’s reporting). However, it goes well beyond that. The entire story is worth a full and complete read but I will quote the a sampling of extremely alarming statements:</p><blockquote>Four days after Donald Trump’s inauguration, Elon Musk’s top lieutenants at the Treasury Department asked its acting secretary, a career civil servant, <strong>to immediately shut off all USAID payments using the department’s own ultra-sensitive payment processing system</strong>. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>“What we would like to do is, to the extent permitted by law, <strong>temporarily pause the automatic processing of payment files,”</strong> from a USAID division called Health Systems Strengthening, [Treasury Chief of Staff] Katz wrote.</blockquote><blockquote>Katz also wrote that Krause, Musk’s deputy at Treasury, should be given access to the payments system so he and his team could take action.</blockquote><blockquote>Some of the administration’s plan, Katz added, included immediately pausing all payment files still in the queue and letting Krause and others look at individual payments certified by USAID for the health care systems. The State Department could then look closer at the payments through USAID, Katz added. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>“There are also practical and personal liability issues that may come into play,” Lebryk wrote, copying a lawyer from the Treasury Department’s general counsel’s office.</blockquote><blockquote>But Krause, the special hire from DOGE sent to Treasury, was undeterred. “I would also recommend you consider an equal alternative liability,” he wrote to Lebryk. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>Initially, Bessent didn’t give Krause and DOGE any limitation on its access to the system, which Lebryk opposed, according to a source familiar with the exchange. [Emphasis Added]</blockquote><p>This is among the worst case scenarios I <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>wrote about on Monday</u></a> (including in <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-doge-treasury-payment-systems-report-1235252444/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Rolling Stone</u></a>) outside of total system meltdown.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfSrnhbq17cJhuhKdqCqdjaP5AbmajxunZ0FIvhtnTtJAFeWXLN7tmdyCn732ZlzMkRDnXTruUskhjoyXbqxBzrKxbzsP1lFc2cy2pNE4oGRmcjvp1LEyTS491viWMI-qzuMmIg?key=XyC64LEPo_d2BlsCgkMLpNSn\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"313\"></figure><p>As I said <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>on Monday</u></a>:</p><blockquote>This is the absolutely <strong>crucial part. </strong>Without political control of the payment's heart, the Trump administration and Elon Musk must chase down every agency and bend it to their will. They are in the process of doing that, but bureaucrats can notionally continue to respect the law and resist their efforts. They are helped in this effort by court injunctions they can point to. This is bureaucratic trench warfare. But if Musk and Trump can reach into the choke point, the<strong> Bureau of the Fiscal Service,</strong> they could possibly <strong>not need</strong> agency cooperation. They can just <strong>impound agency payments themselves</strong>. They could also possibly <strong>stop paying federal employees they have forced on paid administrative leave, coercing them to resign</strong>. These possibilities are what every Treasury expert I’ve talked to instantly thought of the moment they read the Washington Post reporting and are incredibly alarmed about.</blockquote><p>I have never felt worse about being completely right in my entire life. If anything, I have not been striking a <strong>dire enough</strong> tone.</p><p>Every single person involved in this, from Secretary Bessent to Chief of Staff Dan Katz needs to be removed from the Treasury, not just Krause and Marko Elez. This all also adds credibility to what I reported from two anonymous sources on Monday:</p><blockquote>I can exclusively report here for the first time that Scott Bessent was advised that <strong>what Donald Trump wanted in a Treasury Secretary was a person who would have the credibility Steve Mnuchin had with Wall Street but who would be loyal to Trump above all other considerations, according to two sources familiar with the situation</strong>. This included, but was not limited to, unconditionally agreeing to work with whomever Trump sent over to the Treasury Department and helping go after Donald Trump’s enemies.</blockquote><p>No outlet has even mentioned that I reported this because of how explosive it is. They will only mention my reporting if they receive independent corroboration. I hope they do. The fact that there is no current mechanism for removing these people from the Treasury means that this is the <strong>greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War</strong>.

Here's my address: bc1qegxarzsfga9ycesfa7wm77sqmuqqv7083c6ss6\n\n\n\nI originally was going to do a media roundup but it was getting so long that it would distract from my original reporting. I may have a whole piece devoted to a media roundup this afternoon. Anyway, time to dive in.\n\nThe war over “Read and Write” continues. In court, in congress & in the press on Wednesday the Trump administration had been officially denying that DOGE programmers had Read and Write access. For the first time, the administration has acknowledged by name that Marko Elez has access to the top secret systems of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s payment systems. No one in government had publicly acknowledged that the 25 year old former Spacex programmer had such sensitive access. Their “defense” of this is that this is “read only” access.\n\nWe’ll return to whether that is true in a moment. For now it's important to step back and understand how enormous of an acknowledgement that is. To have “read only” access would involve enormous security risks and the ability to exploit extremely, absurdly, sensitive information to the benefit of Elon Musk, Trump and his inner orbit or anyone else that Marko Elez or DOGE employees (and in some cases, seemingly not employees) feels like. For more on this, read the end of my first article yesterday.\n\nFor now, there seems to be a tiny bit of good news which also confirms the previous reporting by Wired, myself and Talking Points Memo. I can exclusively report that Marko Elez had full “read and write” privileges. A source familiar with the situation stated to me:\n\nIt's likely yours and WIRED's reporting is actually doing something. On Saturday, they had given Marko read/write access and marked his access request as completed and closed. There was no mistake in their wording: they explicitly said they had given Marko  read/write access to SPS. On Wednesday, they reopened his access request and stated his permissions were now read only. [Emphasis Added]\n\nSo the reporting on this has had a dramatic effect on the U.S. Treasury. They are hearing the outside voices and the increasing alarm emerging throughout the country and they are reacting, however limited that reaction is. \n\nIt's important to understand that this happened before the injunction which as of this writing was agreed to late on wednesday between Three Federal Unions and the Department of Justice over access to Treasury records. Unconscionably in my view, though I can’t speak to the legal specifics of the case (too much to do), the Union’s lawyers have agreed to “read only” access for Thomas Krause and Marko Elez. I hope the judge blocks the injunction and pushes for something more stringent.\n\nA source familiar with the situation who I asked about the current circumstances and the latest state of play of “read only” versus ‘read and write” had this to say:\n\nAgain, it's a distinction that doesn't matter too much to me. He shouldn't have access to this almost 5 trillion dollar payment flow, even if it's \"read-only\". He shouldn't even be at Fiscal Service. None of this should be happening and it's only going to get worse the longer \"DOGE\" is here and the more they learn about what they can do and get away with.\n\nIn other words, while it's good news that they are reacting to our reporting, the situation still remains catastrophic at best and we can’t relent until this has been resolved. The courts also need to do a better job here (to the extent that’s even possible). \n\nI will also say that I’ve had the most consistent, most detailed and most up-to-date reporting so I do not think it is any exaggeration to say that this is uniquely related to my efforts. I have been doing interviews non-stop and, notably, Bloomberg’s Oddlots posted their episode at 4 AM. Oddlots is the first mainstream financial press publication which has taken this issue seriously (outside of similar “straight laced” news coverage like the Times or the Wall Street Journal has been doing).\n\nIt also helps that my contribution was the most dramatic, concerning and specific Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway could have gotten from a guest (that was willing to speak on the record). If you have personal knowledge of the release of my Oddlots episode or any other reporting causing concern or alarm at the White House, at DOGE or the U.S. Treasury please contact me by email or securely over Signal. As an aside, every single American should currently be migrating all their text messaging to Signal.\n\nStill, the question remains, is Marko Elez actually “read only”? I can exclusively report here that the answer is “kind of”. Specifically, a source familiar with the situation knows for a fact that Marko Elez’s access was set to “insert” for the Secure Payment System (SPS), which is distinct from “alter”. According to a source unfamiliar with the situation this type of permission lets you “add a row to a table” which is a “type of write access but very limited”. According to my source who is unfamiliar with the situation it lets you “create data but not change its structure or delete it, create tables etc.”\n\nWhat can be done with this permission? By definition, my source unfamiliar with the situation can’t say. My unfamiliar source points out that “a lot of that also does depend on the structure of the overall system, inserting things into tables could certainly do things like stop payments!”. Of course, this source is simply speculating. The only way to know for sure is to hear from a current COBOL programmer working on PAM, SPS or another highly sensitive system which makes sure trillions of dollars of Treasury payments go out each year.\n\nIt can’t be confirmed with 100% certainty how many systems Marko Elez’s permissions were switched to “insert only”. A source familiar with the situation says in reference to this:  \n\nPAM [Payment Automation Manager] I am still trying to figure out. \n\nA source familiar with the situation states that there is some evidence that these changes were identical across “object schemas” but as of this writing the only change to “insert only” access that can be confirmed is the Secure Payment System (SPS). \n\nSo from what we know as of this moment, DOGE’s Marko Elez’s permissions got switched from “read and write” to “read and limited write” for SPS, and there is reason to believe, but not confirmation, that this was true across systems. The capacity for “insert” to wreak havoc is not currently known by any source I have or any publicly known information. It requires understanding the system architecture and business logic of the most top secret mainframes in the world- well most top secret until Marko Elez got into them. Given DOGE’s outside, insecure equipment throughout the Federal Government and ability to get alone time with systems elsewhere, it can’t be ruled out that Marko Elez can break into the system and give himself his full “read and write” privileges back.\n\nIn short, keep it up and let's keep on escalating the scale of the objections to this profoundly dire situation. You are not powerless, however the rush shock of this terrifying moment makes you feel.\n\nSubscribeInstitutional subscription detailsPrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><strong>Notes on the Crises pivoted over the weekend into around the clock coverage of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025</strong></p><p><strong>Read </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><strong><u>Part 0</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><strong><u>Part 1</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><strong><u>Part 2</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-six-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025/\"><strong><u>Part 3</u></strong></a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/changing-the-treasury-payments-source-code-the-treasurys-doge-gag-order/\"><strong><u>Part </u></strong></a><strong><u>4</u></strong></p><p><em>If you are a <strong>current or former career Bureau of the Fiscal Service Employee</strong>, especially if you’re a legacy IT programmer with years of experience<strong> and especially if you are a COBOL programmer currently working on the PAM, SPS or any other adjacent team,</strong> contact me </em><a href=\"mailto:crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><em><u>over email</u></em></a><em> or over signal — </em><a href=\"https://signal.me/?ref=crisesnotes.com#eu/TJspTqx16dD39zG7EKpRYYli9_GTNen7cEL7sAug9gdsPRAdW41JzIywiy5y3lXF\"><em><u>linked here</u></em></a><em>.

I may have a whole piece devoted to a media roundup this afternoon. Anyway, time to dive in.</p><p>The war over “Read and Write” continues. <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-weigh-block-doge-accessing-treasury-department-records/story?id=118498817&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>In court</u></a>, in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/treasury-systems-trump-bessent-doge-musk-08eb241fc60807b5e1c7b35fcdaee245?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>congress &amp; in the press</u></a> on Wednesday the Trump administration had been officially denying that DOGE programmers had Read and Write access. For the first time, the administration has acknowledged by name that Marko Elez has access to the top secret systems of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s payment systems. No one in government had publicly acknowledged that the 25 year old former Spacex programmer had such sensitive access. Their “defense” of this is that this is “read only” access.</p><p>We’ll return to whether that is true in a moment. For now it's important to step back and understand how enormous of an acknowledgement that is. To have “read only” access would involve enormous security risks and the ability to exploit extremely, absurdly, sensitive information to the benefit of Elon Musk, Trump and his inner orbit or anyone else that Marko Elez or DOGE employees (and in some cases, seemingly not employees) feels like. For more on this, read the end of my <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-six-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025/\"><u>first article yesterday</u></a>.</p><p>For now, there seems to be a tiny bit of good news which also confirms the previous reporting by <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-associate-bfs-federal-payment-system/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Wired</u></a>, myself and <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/musk-cronies-dive-into-treasury-dept-payments-code-base?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Talking Points Memo</u></a>. I can exclusively report that Marko Elez <strong>had</strong> full “read and write” privileges. A source familiar with the situation stated to me:</p><blockquote>It's <strong>likely yours and WIRED's reporting is actually doing something</strong>. On Saturday, they had given Marko read/write access and <strong>marked his access request as completed and closed</strong>. There was no mistake in their wording: <strong>they explicitly said they had given Marko </strong>&nbsp;<strong>read/write access to SPS</strong>. On Wednesday, <strong>they reopened his access request and stated his permissions were now read only</strong>. [Emphasis Added]</blockquote><p>So the reporting on this has had a dramatic effect on the U.S. Treasury. They are hearing the outside voices and the increasing alarm emerging throughout the country and they are reacting, however limited that reaction is.&nbsp;</p><p>It's important to understand that this happened <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-weigh-block-doge-accessing-treasury-department-records/story?id=118498817&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>before the injunction</u></a> which as of this writing was agreed to late on wednesday between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/federal-employee-lawsuit-musk-doge?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Three Federal Unions</u></a> and the Department of Justice over access to Treasury records. Unconscionably in my view, though I can’t speak to the legal specifics of the case (too much to do), the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-weigh-block-doge-accessing-treasury-department-records/story?id=118498817&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Union’s lawyers have agreed to “read only”</u></a> access for Thomas Krause and Marko Elez. I hope the judge blocks the injunction and pushes for something more stringent.</p><p>A source familiar with the situation who I asked about the current circumstances and the latest state of play of “read only” versus ‘read and write” had this to say:</p><blockquote>Again, it's a distinction that <strong>doesn't matter too much to me</strong>. He shouldn't have access to this almost 5 trillion dollar payment flow, even if it's \"read-only\". <strong>He shouldn't even be at Fiscal Service</strong>. None of this should be happening and it's only going to get worse the longer \"DOGE\" is here and the <strong>more they learn about what they can do and get away with</strong>.</blockquote><p>In other words, while it's good news that they are reacting to our reporting, the situation still remains catastrophic at best and we can’t relent until this has been resolved. The courts also need to do a better job here (to the extent that’s even possible).&nbsp;</p><p>I will also say that I’ve had the most consistent, most detailed and most up-to-date reporting so I do not think it is any exaggeration to say that this is uniquely related to my efforts. I have been doing interviews non-stop and, notably, Bloomberg’s Oddlots <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-05/why-does-elon-musk-want-access-to-the-bureau-of-fiscal-service?srnd=homepage-americas&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>posted their episode at 4 AM</u></a>. Oddlots is the first mainstream financial press publication which has taken this issue seriously (outside of similar “straight laced” news coverage like the Times or the Wall Street Journal has been doing). </p><p>It also helps that my contribution was the most dramatic, concerning and specific Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway could have gotten from a guest (that was willing to speak on the record). If you have personal knowledge of the release of my Oddlots episode or any other reporting causing concern or alarm at the White House, at DOGE or the U.S. Treasury please contact me by email or securely over Signal. As an aside, every single American should currently be migrating all their text messaging to Signal.</p><p>Still, the question remains, is Marko Elez actually “read only”? I can exclusively report here that the answer is <strong>“kind of”</strong>. Specifically, a source familiar with the situation knows for a fact that Marko Elez’s access was set to “insert” for the Secure Payment System (SPS), which is distinct from “alter”. According to a source unfamiliar with the situation this type of permission lets you “add a row to a table” which is a “<strong>type of write access but very limited”</strong>. According to my source who is unfamiliar with the situation it lets you “create data but not change its structure or delete it, create tables etc.”</p><p>What can be done with this permission? By definition, my source unfamiliar with the situation can’t say. My unfamiliar source points out that “a lot of that also does depend on the structure of the overall system, inserting things into tables could certainly do things like stop payments!”. Of course, this source is simply speculating. The only way to know for sure is to hear from a current COBOL programmer working on PAM, SPS or another highly sensitive system which makes sure trillions of dollars of Treasury payments go out each year.</p><p>It can’t be confirmed with 100% certainty how many systems Marko Elez’s permissions were switched to “insert only”. A source familiar with the situation says in reference to this:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote>PAM [Payment Automation Manager] I am still trying to figure out.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>A source familiar with the situation states that there is some evidence that these changes were identical across “object schemas” but as of this writing the only change to “insert only” access that can be confirmed is the Secure Payment System (SPS).&nbsp;</p><p>So from what we know as of this moment, DOGE’s Marko Elez’s permissions got switched from “read and write”<strong> to “read and limited write”</strong> for SPS, and there is reason to believe, but not confirmation, that this was true across systems.

So far, nowhere near enough rich people are paying their fair share.\n\nNote to Readers: I am on bluesky, an alternative to twitter. It's been hard to let go of twitter since that is where I built my following, but clearly it's becoming less usable and there are obvious concerns about getting traction about a Musk story on the Everything Musk app. I have also started an instagram for Notes on the Crises which will be populated soon.\n\nSubscribe\n\nIn a Notes on the Crises first, I have a second piece on the same day. This story is developing so rapidly, that I think it’s important to try to get stuff out there as quickly as I possibly can. First, I’m going to mention the Odd Lots interview again because email readers wouldn’t have gotten that (I updated the article at 9 AM). Thanks to Tracy Alloway and Joe Weisenthal for having me on: this is my one interview this week which was pre-scheduled as I was originally going to talk about all things Federal Reserve and FOIA.\n\nThe Treasury Payment System Elon Musk Now Has Access To: What is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service?:\n\nElon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have gained access to a unit within the Treasury Department called the Bureau of Fiscal Service. But what does this unit actually do? How critical of a role does it play in the operations of government, and potentially, financial markets? On this episode, we speak with Nathan Tankus, the author of the Notes On The Crises newsletter. He explains both the technical aspect of this office, as well as the legal questions surrounding impoundment and the ability of the executive branch to cut off payments that have been previously authorized by Congress. We also talk about the operational risks and the potential disaster scenario should this system — which has been built in COBOL over decades — go down.\n\nNow onto my reporting. A source with direct knowledge of the situation informs me:\n\nSenior IT staff confirmed that Marko has read and write access. This is no longer a point of doubt.\n\nThe white house continues to dispute this and the mainstream press continues to largely report the “read only” factoid, which as I pointed out in my piece this morning is somewhat of a red-herring. However, I have reason to believe the tide will turn (at least somewhat) on this soon. \n\nIt is also interesting that they won’t comment or name Marko Elez, only Tom Krause. The Treasury letter from yesterday describes him as:\n\nMr. Krause is a longtime technology executive. His decades of experience in building companies and managing balance sheets as a chief financial officer are of great benefit to this review. In order to allow him to perform this function, he has been hired as an expert/consultant by the federal government and designated in a role commonly used across Administrations—a “special government employee” —pursuant to applicable law.\n\nA source familiar with the situation reports to me that:\n\nThe fact that Treasury only talked about Krause shows they're trying to protect Marko. They are also doing a lot more to protect Marko. As an example: there is a gag order on BFS IT personnel right now. They are not permitted to discuss \"DOGE\", even in discussions internal to the Bureau. I have never seen anything like this before.\n\nMarko Elez’s unchecked behavior throughout the most sensitive payments infrastructure in the United States is something they are working very hard to protect.\n\nIt has been reported by Josh Marshall at Turning Points Memo that source code is already being changed. I can’t confirm that reporting from my sources but I can confirm source code changes are being actively pursued. A source informs me:\n\nThomas Krause and Marko Elez are having discussions about PAM source code changes. Other people are in the conversation as well. I have no other details about this.\n\nSource code changes are of course an extremely dangerous scenario and if they are actively happening we are already beyond the “critical danger of catastrophe” point and into something else. This process must be aborted as soon as possible.\n\nRegarding the attitude and mood of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s IT staff, a source familiar with the situation states:\n\nthe BFS IT staff hate this. And I mean hate it. All of the \"DOGE\" stuff. I have never seen them more quietly pissed off, but they largely seem like they're keeping their heads down.\n\nThis is all I have to report now, I will keep readers updated. For why this is a disaster in a myriad ways, check out my morning piece. \n\nPlease take out a paid subscription, and I would especially like to speak to financial professionals, even CEOs and high level extremely wealthy figures in our society of all kinds. What I am doing is an attempt which if successful also protects you from Trump and Musk’s unchecked power. Some of you have started to step in a little, but not nearly enough. I do not have a single “Platinum level subscriber” from the onset of the current crisis. You have the most to lose in this situation, whether you realize it or not. If one of you were smart, you could get in contact with me and offer me 100,000 dollars or more with no strings attached so I could hire people and expand my reporting capacity. In comparison, 5000 grand is a small amount. I also offer proxy level access to my whole newsletter for institutional subscriptions.\n\nSubscribeInstitutional subscription detailsPrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><em>If you are a <strong>current or former career Bureau of the Fiscal Service Employee</strong>, especially if you’re a legacy IT programmer with years of experience<strong> and especially if you are a COBOL programmer currently working on the PAM, SPS or any other adjacent team,</strong> contact me </em><a href=\"mailto:crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><em><u>over email</u></em></a><em> or over signal — </em><a href=\"https://signal.me/?ref=crisesnotes.com#eu/TJspTqx16dD39zG7EKpRYYli9_GTNen7cEL7sAug9gdsPRAdW41JzIywiy5y3lXF\"><em><u>linked here</u></em></a><em>.

Thanks to Tracy Alloway and Joe Weisenthal for having me on: this is my one interview this week which was pre-scheduled as I was originally going to talk about all things Federal Reserve and FOIA.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-05/why-does-elon-musk-want-access-to-the-bureau-of-fiscal-service?srnd=undefined&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>The Treasury Payment System Elon Musk Now Has Access To</u>: <u>What is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service?</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have gained access to a unit within the Treasury Department called the Bureau of Fiscal Service. But what does this unit actually do? How critical of a role does it play in the operations of government, and potentially, financial markets? On this episode, we speak with Nathan Tankus, the author of the Notes On The Crises newsletter. He explains both the technical aspect of this office, as well as the legal questions surrounding impoundment and the ability of the executive branch to cut off payments that have been previously authorized by Congress. We also talk about the operational risks and the potential disaster scenario should this system — which has been built in COBOL over decades — go down.</blockquote><hr><p>Now onto my reporting. A source with direct knowledge of the situation informs me:</p><blockquote>Senior IT staff <strong>confirmed that Marko has read and write access</strong>. This is no longer a point of doubt.</blockquote><p>The white house continues to dispute this and the mainstream press continues to largely report the “read only” factoid, which as I pointed out in my piece this morning is somewhat of a red-herring. However, I have reason to believe the tide will turn (at least somewhat) on this soon.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also interesting that they won’t comment or name Marko Elez, only Tom Krause. The Treasury letter from yesterday <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/2025.02.04-Response-to-Sen.-Wyden.pdf\"><u>describes him as</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Mr. Krause is a longtime technology executive. His decades of experience in building companies and managing balance sheets as a chief financial officer are of great benefit to this review. In order to allow him to perform this function, he has been hired as an expert/consultant by the federal government and designated in a role commonly used across Administrations—a “special government employee” —pursuant to applicable law.</blockquote><p>A source familiar with the situation reports to me that:</p><blockquote>The fact that Treasury only talked about Krause shows they're trying to protect Marko. They are also doing a lot more to protect Marko. As an example: there is a gag order on BFS IT personnel right now. They are <strong>not permitted to discuss \"DOGE\", even in discussions internal to the Bureau. I have never seen anything like this before.</strong></blockquote><p>Marko Elez’s unchecked behavior throughout the most sensitive payments infrastructure in the United States is something they are working very hard to protect.</p><p>It has been reported by Josh Marshall at <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/musk-cronies-dive-into-treasury-dept-payments-code-base?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Turning Points Memo that source code</u></a> is already being changed. I can’t confirm that reporting from my sources but I can confirm source code changes are being actively pursued. A source informs me:</p><blockquote>Thomas Krause and Marko Elez are <strong>having discussions about PAM source code changes</strong>. Other people are in the conversation as well. I have no other details about this.</blockquote><p>Source code changes are of course an extremely dangerous scenario and if they are actively happening we are already beyond the “critical danger of catastrophe” point and into something else. This process must be aborted as soon as possible. </p><p>Regarding the attitude and mood of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s IT staff, a source familiar with the situation states:</p><blockquote>the BFS IT staff hate this. And I mean hate it. All of the \"DOGE\" stuff. I have never seen them more quietly pissed off, but they largely seem like they're keeping their heads down.</blockquote><p>This is all I have to report now, I will keep readers updated.

If you’re rich, take out the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025 Platinum Tier subscription. The additional thing you get is me trying to stop the Treasury’s internal payment system from melting down or Musk taking your confidential information, along with everyone else's. So far, nowhere near enough rich people are paying their fair share.\n\n\n\nNote to Readers: I have not mentioned this in the past, but I am on bluesky, an alternative to twitter. It's been hard to let go of twitter since that is where I built my following, but clearly it's becoming less usable and there are obvious concerns about getting traction about a Musk story on the Everything Musk app. I have also started an instagram for Notes on the Crises which will be populated soon.\n\nFirst some media, then some new reporting:\n\nEconomist Paul Krugman, who left the New York Times recently because of its increasingly hostile and hamfisted constraints on his editorial independence, has a very generous citation to my work in his newsletter yesterday:\n\nFor the moment they probably can’t. The federal payments system is immensely complex, and like most government infrastructure has been financially squeezed for decades. So it’s cobbled together, much of it running on old hardware and even older software, kept functioning thanks to old hands and institutional memory. The 20-somethings Musk is deploying to take over, locking out those old hands and pushing aside the people who know how the system works, almost surely don’t understand enough to politicize payments right away.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAs Nathan Tankus, the go-to expert on these matters, says,\n\nI 100% believe that the primary barrier to Elon Musk gaining control of the Treasury payments system is COBOL.\n\nFor readers mystified by the reference, COBOL is a very old programming language that was once pervasive in the business world but in which hardly anyone under 60 knows how to program — yet is still widely used in government. (During Covid, the state of New Jersey put out a frantic call for people who knew COBOL to implement expanded unemployment benefits.)\n\nBut this observation raises another concern. What if the Musk people — Muskovites? — try to muck with systems they don’t understand, believing that they’re super smart and can master everything with the help of a little AI? It’s not hard to imagine the whole federal payments system — including, by the way, servicing of federal debt — crashing.\n\nSo much damage — to U.S. credibility, to the Constitution and the rule of law, and possibly even to the very functioning of the government. And Trump only took power 2 weeks ago.\n\nSo thanks Paul. As I clarified in my newsletter yesterday, it’s largely the complicated and layered business logic and system architecture wrapped in COBOL, rather than COBOL in the abstract, which is the barrier.\n\nUPDATE 9:01 AM: my interview yesterday with Bloomberg Odd Lots- which was actually scheduled in January before all hell broke loose!- is out. Give it a listen here's the description:\n\nElon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have gained access to a unit within the Treasury Department called the Bureau of Fiscal Service. But what does this unit actually do? How critical of a role does it play in the operations of government, and potentially, financial markets? On this episode, we speak with Nathan Tankus, the author of the Notes On The Crises newsletter. He explains both the technical aspect of this office, as well as the legal questions surrounding impoundment and the ability of the executive branch to cut off payments that have been previously authorized by Congress. We also talk about the operational risks and the potential disaster scenario should this system — which has been built in COBOL over decades — go down.\n\n\n\nYesterday, the Acting Assistant Treasury Secretary Jonathan Blum sent a letter on behalf of the United States Treasury responding to Senator Wyden (with identical letters as well to other members of congress) regarding the Treasury Payments crisis. Among other claims and meaningless assurances, it states:\n\nCurrently, Treasury staff members working with Tom Krause, a Treasury employee, will have read-only access to the coded data of the Fiscal Service’s payment systems in order to continue this operational efficiency assessment. [Emphasis added]\n\nI stand by my reporting and thus this is either a lie or a carefully worded evasion. Specifically, the statement could be worded to avoid confirming or denying that they also have write access. To explain what I mean, we must jump to the facts.\n\nSubscribe\n\nOne source is aware of this letter and explicitly denied it late yesterday:\n\nTreasury has been denying that they gave Marko write access, but I am looking at his access request right now and it has the Deputy Assistant Commissioner for IT Operations instructing the team to disregard all previous instructions and assign Marko read/write privileges for the database. \n\nThus, one way that this letter could be technically true in a bizarre and wildly dishonest sense is that by first having “read-only” access and then having “read and write” access, they could be said to have “read-only” and “read and write” access simultaneously.\n\nBut probably the United States Treasury is just lying. \n\nImportantly, according to a source familiar with the situation, Krause does not have a Bureau of the Fiscal Service laptop or email yet. This source says, regarding the fact that the letter does not mention Marko Elez, states “That’s definitely a purposeful evasion”\n\nSubscribe\n\nIn any case, the situation remains extraordinarily, incomprehensibly dire as they continue to have “read and write” access. According to a source familiar with the situation a senior IT employee shared a schedule of blackouts (system outages, typically for maintenance which can include system code changes) for the Payment Automation Manager (PAM), International Treasury Services (ITS) & the Standard Application for Payments (ASAP) to Marko Elez. Recall that PAM is the primary way for the Treasury to send payments, having sent 4.7 trillion dollars last year. \n\nAs I reported in my piece on Monday, ASAP is the crucial mechanism that sends payments to “state and local governments, educational and financial institutions, vendors and contractors, profit and non-profit entities and Indian tribal organizations.” If you want to selectively impound spending, and particularly if you want to target specific non-profits or other disfavored entities (or agencies), this is a crucial system to get control of. Whether they can and how quickly is an extremely open question. Nor do we know that those blackouts were or will be for system changes. A source familiar with the situation has seen Marko involved with conversations about ASAP.\n\nThe other system, International Treasury Payments, is for all international payments. So if you want to target people or entities (crucially foreign non-profits and foreign countries, among many others) that the U.S. government disburses funds to, this is a system you would need to get a handle on. The desire to cut off foreign aid has been repeatedly stated by Trump on down, and if they can get operational control this system would be critical to doing that. Between PAM and ITS this is most of the payments the United States Treasury processes. This is an extraordinary amount of access which, as I said yesterday, is not held by senior IT employees at BFS.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the situation, that same senior IT employee shared “technical documentation and guides” with Marko Elez which explain how to connect and operate a mainframe. It appears to be, though my source can’t confirm, the same one running PAM. According to a source familiar with the situation that makes it \n\nplausible that \"DOGE\" could obtain sufficient technical knowledge to implement some of its horrible ideas. That would likely be worse than outright breaking things, but it remains to be seen what they're actually doing.\n\nIt's important to understand that this source works in the IT operations department and thus is not one of the COBOL programmers working on these systems. I do not have insight into that, which is the main blindspot I’ve had in my current reporting. If you are a current BFS employee working directly on PAM, ITS, ASAP or any of the other COBOL systems I would urge you to get into contact. If you are a relative or friend of someone who works on these systems, I would encourage you to have them contact me (signal & email information above). This could not possibly be more important.\n\nA source familiar with the situation also states that Mark0 Elez has been receiving lots of “technical contact lists”, including for the Secure Payment System (SPS). This source speculates that this means that the teams working on systems like PAM are “mostly intact”. Why seek out contact lists if it's not actually going to help you if a bunch of the people on the list have been fired or pushed to resign?\n\nWhen asked about the general mood at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service my source states:\n\nEveryone else just wants to keep their heads down. They're all miserable and I think they're just trying not to get targeted or fired. Senior leadership seems to be complying with them. No one is really talking openly about it, but it just seems like people are miserable and stressed out. Morale seems very low. We enjoyed our jobs, we did good work, and now we're being targeted by political powers beyond our control. \n\nA source familiar with the situation stated that there is a general norm forming, which is sometimes explicitly stated, to not discuss the Trump executive orders openly. The obvious issue of surveillance comes to mind in such a situation.\n\nI want to end on a few words stepping back and explaining why this is such a big deal. So they have “read and write” access, or even “read only” access, why do we care? What are the possible consequences? \n\n 1. Musk, Trump and their respective cronies have unrestricted access to your social security numbers, your confidential bank information, your confidential medical information and so much more. \n\nThis is true with just “read only” access. This is why the burgeoning media war (that currently “read only” is winning unfortunately) is something of a red-herring. It matters, don’t get me wrong. As a source yesterday said, Apocalyptic. But that source also said that “read only” was “catastrophic”. If the smash and grab operation commences just as stupidly, quickly and dangerously as it has so far, this could easily become identity theft by an untold number of people using their personally identifiable information within weeks.\n\nThis kind of information can also be used to target enemies and, if they get operational control elsewhere, the capability of using the Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC), & the Combating the Finance of Terror (CFT) laws to target political enemies. Of course, these laws have already been used to target political dissidents; but we are talking about something of an incomprehensibly larger scale. As one long time payments lawyer wrote to me: “Is DOGE using its own, non-OFAC definition of ‘terrorist group’ that has no basis in law?” In this sense, the Democratic party has fully and unequivocally participated in building the apparatus that is showing to be extraordinarily easily weaponized against them. In short, they can not just steal money but eliminate the financial existence of anyone they felt like, if operational control gets sufficient. The week Trump won his second term, I told a room full of Democratic party operatives that “if the Democratic Party really believed Trump was a fascist, they would destroy the servers containing all the surveillance data”\n\n 2. Creating “backdoors” into the Treasury’s multi-trillion dollar payment system\n\nI’m running short on time (it's late at the time of writing) and I have to get up in the morning and be prepared for another round of intensive interviews so this will have to be more carefully detailed in the future. But these are extremely sensitive systems, and complicated systems. All the factors that slow them down in taking over the system are also the factors that would make it hard to find intentionally hidden code to their benefit that could give them ongoing access to the system even if they are removed. I need to do more reporting on this one but it is something many, many sources have mentioned.\n\nSubscribe\n 3. Subordinate the judicial system to the Trump Administration/DOGE\n\nThis one has been hard to get across to readers. As you can imagine, the overwhelming social media response to this reporting has focused on the absurd illegality of the actions. Asking for judicial intervention. But as I covered in my piece Friday, the constitution is not self enforcing and the supreme court is unlikely to step in, or to step in a positive way. In my Friday’s piece I unfortunately presciently asked:\n\nAs a famous twentieth century statesman might have said in this situation \"...and how many divisions does the Constitution have?” \n\nWhat happens if they are just embedded so deeply in the heart of government payments that there is no mechanism to dislodge them? Court Injunctions are not self enforcing either My longtime payments lawyer source agrees with this point, which I also tried to articulate Monday:\n\nChokehold to stop or delay any and all payments initiated by federal agencies, and potential mechanical method to thwart judicial rulings when a judge/court says “You as the Executive Branch cannot stop federal grants/payments lawfully approved and directed by Congress.”\n\nAs we’ve seen, there are no armed law enforcement figures coming in to save the day and if Musk's DOGE get deep enough into the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the only way to enforce the law is through street actions.\n\n 4. Elon Musk can use this system against his enemies.\n\nIt almost feels quant to say because the timeline of so many of the other possibilities are so immediately and dramatically dire that this one almost feels hopeful in comparison in that it implies “competitive position” being something that is very meaningful. Nevertheless, it should be obvious that this information, which includes information on all businesses the Federal Government does business with, is ripe to be used to kneecap competitors. Specifically my longtime payments lawyer source brought up just outright putting competitors on the “do not pay” list. The “good case scenario” may just be an economy increasingly dominated in all corners by Musk and/or Trump through a sprawling network of business ventures with the greatest possible advantages.\n\n 5. The New American Payments System, X the Everything App\n\nFor this one I am just going to quote my longtime payments lawyer source at length. They’ve got it and note this is a “read only” issue. Imagine the worst case of paying your taxes on X payments, or “receiving” your social security payments there.:\n\nObtaining access to and potentially exfiltrating data sets from BFS that may be characterized as “anonymized” (in order to evade criticism about potential violation of privacy laws), but could give insight into payment patterns and payment system strengths, weaknesses and behaviors:\n\n1. Such information obtained on an inside track by DOGE would be very helpful, for example, if you are an entity like X Payments LLC and are currently licensed as a money transmitter in 42 states with plans to launch as-yet-to-be specified payments and financial services.\n\n2. It is unclear whether there are any limitations on DOGE personnel transferring payment information to X Payments LLC in order for that company to gain proprietary information regarding federal payments in an anti-competitive manner compared to its fintech competitors currently in the marketplace.\n\n3. Such single-sourced information not available to other market competitors would provide an anti-competitive jump for X Payments LLC on ApplePay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay (mobile wallets) and a host of other fintech companies in the marketplace backed by venture capital and private equity funding.\n\n 6. Ability to pick and choose who gets public money, regardless of congressional directives\n\nI covered the constitutional aspects of this crisis Friday. The payment aspects I covered Monday. Without Judicial ability or willingness to sanction Trump & Musk, There is very little left of congress. The “power of the purse” is central to the rule and authority of congress. The decentralized (in relative terms) nature of administrative agencies means that there are enormous opportunities for agencies to follow the law. This is a place to skip past all those headaches.\n\nSubscribe\n 7. Catastrophic failure of the payments system.\n\nEven a disruption for a day would be a disaster. A disruption on longer timescales would have unimaginable knock on effects. The Treasury could involuntarily default because of operational issues. The worst case scenarios, which are completely and utterly plausible at the time of writing, would be a catastrophe without precedent. No typical economic calamity like the Great Financial Crisis or even the Great Depression would be comparable. \n\nTLDR, here is what I told Norwegian national daily newspaper Klassekampen, one of the largest newspapers in Norway, when asked for comment:\n\nThe reason this is so incredibly important is that the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's payment system sits at the very heart of the United States Federal Government. 88% of government payments, which amounts to about 5.4 Trillion dollars, flows through this system every year and onto the wider economy. Its social security checks, medicare and medicaid payments to medical providers etc. It's everything, in short. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service is the payments intermediary where all payment orders from the various government agencies get routed to their intended recipients. If anything happened to this system, the payments would not go out and that would lead to catastrophe. It could also lead to an unintentional operational default on United States treasury securities.\n\nIt also is an enormous privacy violation where former employees of Musk who have not properly gotten security clearance are able to install insecure technology and steal the most sensitive information possible. They could theoretically use banking information of people they identify as enemies and put them on terror watch lists, or \"do not pay\" lists if they can get enough operational control at the treasury. Part of why this is, as one current Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee described it, apocalyptic is that all the ways that this can be abused are incalculable and would take years to fully map. To the extent that the sudden collapse of the United States would have a negative effect on the rest of the world, this is as much of a global crisis as it is a national one\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><em>If you are a <strong>current or former career Bureau of the Fiscal Service Employee</strong>, especially if you’re a legacy IT programmer with years of experience<strong> and especially if you are a COBOL programmer currently working on the PAM, SPS or any other adjacent team,</strong> contact me </em><a href=\"mailto:crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><em><u>over email</u></em></a><em> or over signal — </em><a href=\"https://signal.me/?ref=crisesnotes.com#eu/TJspTqx16dD39zG7EKpRYYli9_GTNen7cEL7sAug9gdsPRAdW41JzIywiy5y3lXF\"><em><u>linked here</u></em></a><em>.

The federal payments system is immensely complex, and like most government infrastructure has been financially squeezed for decades. So it’s cobbled together, much of it running on old hardware and even older software, kept functioning thanks to old hands and institutional memory. The 20-somethings Musk is deploying to take over, locking out those old hands and pushing aside the people who know how the system works, almost surely don’t understand enough to politicize payments right away.</blockquote><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><blockquote><strong>As Nathan Tankus, the go-to expert on these matters, says</strong>,</blockquote><blockquote class=\"kg-blockquote-alt\">I 100% believe that the primary barrier to Elon Musk gaining control of the Treasury payments system is COBOL.</blockquote><blockquote>For readers mystified by the reference, COBOL is a very old programming language that was once pervasive in the business world but in which hardly anyone under 60 knows how to program — yet is still widely used in government. (During Covid, the state of New Jersey put out a frantic call for people who knew COBOL to implement expanded unemployment benefits.)</blockquote><blockquote>But this observation raises another concern. What if the Musk people — Muskovites? — try to muck with systems they don’t understand, believing that they’re super smart and can master everything with the help of a little AI? It’s not hard to imagine the whole federal payments system — including, by the way, servicing of federal debt — crashing.</blockquote><blockquote>So much damage — to U.S. credibility, to the Constitution and the rule of law, and possibly even to the very functioning of the government. And Trump only took power 2 weeks ago.</blockquote><p>So thanks Paul. As I clarified <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>in my newsletter yesterday</u></a>, it’s largely the complicated and layered business logic and system architecture wrapped in COBOL, rather than COBOL in the abstract, which is the barrier. <br><br>UPDATE 9:01 AM: my interview yesterday with Bloomberg Odd Lots- which was actually scheduled in January before all hell broke loose!- <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-05/why-does-elon-musk-want-access-to-the-bureau-of-fiscal-service?srnd=homepage-americas&ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">is out.</a> Give it a listen here's the description:</p><blockquote>Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have gained access to a unit within the Treasury Department called the Bureau of Fiscal Service. But what does this unit actually do? How critical of a role does it play in the operations of government, and potentially, financial markets? On this episode, we speak with Nathan Tankus, the author of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Notes On The Crises</em></a>&nbsp;newsletter. He explains both the technical aspect of this office, as well as the legal questions surrounding impoundment and the ability of the executive branch to cut off payments that have been previously authorized by Congress. We also talk about the operational risks and the potential disaster scenario should this system — which has been built in COBOL over decades — go down.</blockquote><ol></ol><p></p><p>Yesterday, the Acting Assistant Treasury Secretary Jonathan Blum sent a letter on behalf of the United States Treasury responding to Senator Wyden (with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-payments.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>identical letters as well</u></a> to other members of congress) regarding the Treasury Payments crisis. Among other claims and meaningless assurances, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/2025.02.04-Response-to-Sen.-Wyden.pdf\"><u>it states</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Currently, Treasury staff members working with Tom Krause, a Treasury employee,<strong> will have read-only access</strong> to the coded data of the Fiscal Service’s payment systems in order to continue this operational efficiency assessment. [Emphasis added]</blockquote><p>I stand by my reporting and thus this is either a lie or a carefully worded evasion. Specifically, the statement could be worded to avoid confirming or denying that they also have write access. To explain what I mean, we must jump to the facts.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>One source is aware of this letter and explicitly denied it late yesterday:</p><blockquote>Treasury has been denying that they gave Marko write access, <strong>but I am looking at his access request right now </strong>and it has the Deputy Assistant Commissioner for IT Operations instructing the team to <strong>disregard all previous instructions and assign Marko read/write privileges for the database</strong>.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Thus, one way that this letter could be technically true in a bizarre and wildly dishonest sense is that by first having “read-only” access and then having “read and write” access, they could be said to have “read-only” and “read and write” access simultaneously.</p><p>But probably the United States Treasury is just lying.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, according to a source familiar with the situation, Krause does not have a Bureau of the Fiscal Service laptop or email yet. This source says, regarding the fact that the letter does not mention Marko Elez, states “That’s definitely a purposeful evasion”</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>In any case, the <strong>situation remains extraordinarily, incomprehensibly dire</strong> as they continue to have “read and write” access. According to a source familiar with the situation a senior IT employee shared a schedule of blackouts (system outages, typically for maintenance which can include system code changes) for the Payment Automation Manager (PAM), International Treasury Services (ITS) &amp; the Standard Application for Payments (ASAP) to Marko Elez. Recall that PAM is the primary way for the Treasury to send payments, having sent 4.7 trillion dollars last year.&nbsp;</p><p>As I reported in my piece on Monday, ASAP is the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">crucial mechanism that sends</a> payments to “state and local governments, educational and financial institutions, vendors and contractors, profit and non-profit entities and Indian tribal organizations.” If you want to selectively impound spending, and particularly if you want to target specific non-profits or other disfavored entities (or agencies), this is a crucial system to get control of. Whether they can and how quickly is an extremely open question. Nor do we know that those blackouts were or will be for system changes. A source familiar with the situation has seen Marko involved with conversations about ASAP.</p><p>The other system, International Treasury Payments, <a href=\"https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/pia/ITS-pclia.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>is for all international payments</u></a>. So if you want to target people or entities (crucially foreign non-profits and foreign countries, among many others) that the U.S. government disburses funds to, this is a system you would need to get a handle on. The desire to cut off foreign aid has been repeatedly stated by Trump on down, and if they can get operational control this system would be critical to doing that. Between PAM and ITS this is most of the payments the United States Treasury processes. This is an extraordinary amount of access which, as I said yesterday, is not held by senior IT employees at BFS.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>According to a source familiar with the situation, that same senior IT employee shared “technical documentation and guides” with Marko Elez which explain how to connect and operate a mainframe. It appears to be, though my source can’t confirm, the same one running PAM. According to a source familiar with the situation that makes it&nbsp;</p><blockquote>plausible that \"DOGE\" <strong>could obtain sufficient technical knowledge to implement some of its horrible ideas</strong>. That would<strong> likely be worse than outright breaking things</strong>, but it remains to be seen what they're actually doing.</blockquote><p>It's important to understand that this source works in the IT operations department and thus is not one of the COBOL programmers working on these systems. I do not have insight into that, which is the main blindspot I’ve had in my current reporting. If you are a current BFS employee working directly on PAM, ITS, ASAP or any of the other COBOL systems I would <strong>urge you to get into contact</strong>. If you are a<strong> relative or friend of someone who works on these systems</strong>, I would encourage you to have them contact me (signal &amp; email information above). This could not possibly be more important.</p><p>A source familiar with the situation also states that Mark0 Elez has been receiving lots of “technical contact lists”, including for the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>Secure Payment System (SPS)</u></a>. This source speculates that this means that the teams working on systems like PAM are “mostly intact”. Why seek out contact lists if it's not actually going to help you if a bunch of the people on the list have been fired or pushed to resign?</p><p>When asked about the general mood at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service my source states:</p><blockquote>Everyone else just wants to keep their heads down. They're all miserable and I think they're just trying not to get targeted or fired. Senior leadership seems to be complying with them. No one is really talking openly about it, but it just seems like people are miserable and stressed out. <strong>Morale seems very low. We enjoyed our jobs, we did good work, and now we're being targeted by political powers beyond our control.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><p>A source familiar with the situation stated that there is a general norm forming, which is sometimes explicitly stated, to not discuss the Trump executive orders openly. The obvious issue of surveillance comes to mind in such a situation.</p><p>I want to end on a few words stepping back and explaining why this is such a big deal. So they have “read and write” access, or even “read only” access, why do we care? What are the possible consequences?&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Musk, Trump and their respective cronies have unrestricted access to your social security numbers, your confidential bank information, your confidential medical information and so much more.&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>This is true with <strong>just “read only”</strong> access. This is why the burgeoning media war (that currently “read only” is winning unfortunately) is something of a red-herring. It matters, don’t get me wrong. As a source yesterday said, Apocalyptic. But that source also said that “read only” was “catastrophic”. If the smash and grab operation commences just as stupidly, quickly and dangerously as it has so far, this could easily become<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/musk-treasury-social-security-access-federal-payment-system-trump/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> identity theft by an untold number of people</u></a> using their personally identifiable information within weeks.</p><p>This kind of information can also be used to target enemies and, if they get operational control elsewhere, the capability of using the <a href=\"https://georgialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raul-Carrillo-Seeing-Through-Money-Democracy-Data-Governance-and-the-Digital-Dollar-57-Georgia-Law-Review-1207-2023.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC)</u></a>, &amp; the Combating the Finance of Terror (CFT) laws to target political enemies. Of course, these laws have already been used to <a href=\"https://x.com/NathanTankus/status/1846227224287973422?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>target political dissidents</u></a>; but we are talking about something of an incomprehensibly larger scale. As one long time payments lawyer wrote to me: “Is DOGE using its own, non-OFAC definition of ‘terrorist group’ that has no basis in law?” In this sense, the Democratic party has fully and unequivocally participated in <a href=\"https://georgialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raul-Carrillo-Seeing-Through-Money-Democracy-Data-Governance-and-the-Digital-Dollar-57-Georgia-Law-Review-1207-2023.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>building the apparatus that is showing to be extraordinarily easily weaponized against them</u></a>. In short, they can not just steal money but eliminate the financial existence of anyone they felt like, if operational control gets sufficient.

As you can imagine, the overwhelming social media response to this reporting has focused on the absurd illegality of the actions. Asking for judicial intervention. But as I covered in my piece Friday, the constitution is not self enforcing and the supreme court is unlikely to step in, or to step in a positive way. In my Friday’s piece I unfortunately <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>presciently asked</u></a>:</p><blockquote>As a famous twentieth century statesman might have said in this situation \"...and how many divisions does the Constitution have?”&nbsp;</blockquote><p>What happens if they are just embedded so deeply in the heart of government payments that there is no mechanism to dislodge them?

Nevertheless, it should be obvious that this information, which includes information on all businesses the Federal Government does business with, is ripe to be used to kneecap competitors. Specifically my longtime payments lawyer source brought up just outright putting competitors on the “do not pay” list.

Such information obtained on an inside track by DOGE would be very helpful, for example, if you are an <strong>entity like X Payments LLC and are currently licensed as a money transmitter in 42 states with plans to launch as-yet-to-be specified payments and financial services.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>2. It is unclear <strong>whether there are any limitations on DOGE personnel transferring payment information to X Payments LLC</strong> in order for that company to gain proprietary information regarding federal payments in an anti-competitive manner compared to its fintech competitors currently in the marketplace.</blockquote><blockquote>3.

Without Judicial ability or willingness to sanction Trump &amp; Musk, There is very little left of congress. The “power of the purse” is central to the rule and authority of congress. The decentralized (in relative terms) nature of administrative agencies means that there are enormous opportunities for agencies to follow the law. This is a place to skip past all those headaches.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><ol start=\"7\"><li><strong>Catastrophic failure of the payments system.</strong></li></ol><p>Even a disruption for a day would be a disaster. A disruption on longer timescales would have unimaginable knock on effects. The Treasury could involuntarily default because of operational issues. The worst case scenarios, which are <strong>completely and utterly plausible at the time of writing</strong>, would be a catastrophe without precedent. No typical economic calamity like the Great Financial Crisis or even the Great Depression would be comparable.&nbsp;</p><p>TLDR, here is what I told Norwegian national daily newspaper Klassekampen, one of the largest newspapers in Norway, when asked for comment:</p><blockquote>The reason this is so incredibly important is that the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's payment system sits at the very heart of the United States Federal Government. 88% of government payments, which amounts to about 5.4 Trillion dollars, flows through this system every year and onto the wider economy. Its social security checks, medicare and medicaid payments to medical providers etc. It's everything, in short. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service is the payments intermediary where all payment orders from the various government agencies get routed to their intended recipients. If anything happened to this system, the payments would not go out and that would lead to catastrophe. It could also lead to an unintentional operational default on United States treasury securities.</blockquote><blockquote>It also is an enormous privacy violation where former employees of Musk who have not properly gotten security clearance are able to install insecure technology and steal the most sensitive information possible. They could theoretically use banking information of people they identify as enemies and put them on terror watch lists, or \"do not pay\" lists if they can get enough operational control at the treasury. Part of why this is, as one current Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee described it, apocalyptic is that all the ways that this can be abused are incalculable and would take years to fully map. To the extent that the sudden collapse of the United States would have a negative effect on the rest of the world, this is as much of a global crisis as it is a national one</blockquote><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/Day-Six-of-the-Trump-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025.pdf\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Printer Friendly Version</a></div>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-six-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"6fba778a-2151-4e26-8133-c2c3fbece625","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"67a319f119a2b4000196e4a9","reading_time":12}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"February 4","id":"Ghost__Post__67a206e81d9ece00012a83cd","title":"Day Five of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025: Not “Read Only” access anymore","slug":"day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/02/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.png","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b80808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/45bf3b6f41b2aea20d23bd2ab35c82fb/a502c/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.png","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/45bf3b6f41b2aea20d23bd2ab35c82fb/465f1/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.png 400w,\n/migrantinsider/static/45bf3b6f41b2aea20d23bd2ab35c82fb/28b0a/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.png 800w,\n/migrantinsider/static/45bf3b6f41b2aea20d23bd2ab35c82fb/a502c/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.png 1599w","sizes":"(min-width: 1599px) 1599px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/45bf3b6f41b2aea20d23bd2ab35c82fb/dccb0/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.webp 400w,\n/migrantinsider/static/45bf3b6f41b2aea20d23bd2ab35c82fb/35be4/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.webp 800w,\n/migrantinsider/static/45bf3b6f41b2aea20d23bd2ab35c82fb/f8257/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.webp 1599w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1599px) 1599px, 100vw"}]},"width":1599,"height":828}}},"excerpt":"If you are a current or former career Bureau of the Fiscal Service Employee, especially if you’re a legacy IT programmer with years of experience and especially if you are a COBOL programmer currently working on the PAM, SPS or any other adjacent team, contact me over email or over signal — linked here.

The additional thing you get is me trying to stop the Treasury’s internal payment system from melting down or Musk taking your confidential information, along with everyone else's.\n\nNormally I carefully edit and review what I write in this newsletter for structure, coherence and other writing factors. I have time for, maybe, coherence. My highest priority is factual accuracy. So let's get into it. As readers are certainly aware by now, yesterday I released a bombshell article laying out the crisis that emerged on Friday with Musk and his “DOGE” trying to get operational access and control. The abbreviated version was in Rolling Stone an hour later. I also have done some interviews which have appeared, and one that has not in Marketwatch. I will obviously be doing a ton more interviews as well. My phone and email have been ringing off the proverbial hook for obvious reasons. Here’s what has appeared so far.\n\nAmerican Prospect: ‘Filled With Unmitigated Terror’ A Q&A with Nathan Tankus on what it means for Elon Musk’s forces to have commandeered some level of control of the U.S. payment system.\n\nMajority Report: Elon’s Coup Lights Five-Alarm Plus Fire w/ Nathan Tankus \n\nI am going to state the obvious: Until this crisis is resolved or it fundamentally destroys the ability for economic and social life to continue in the United States, this newsletter is now devoted to this crisis full time. Since reporting and sources which have emerged subsequently to yesterday’s piece which I discuss below, it has become clear that at least some of my worst fears are proving true. Thus I’m officially labeling this crisis the “Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025”. Originally I was going to number this crisis by business days, but as Musk is proudly tweeting about, DOGE is working the weekends. So today is Day 5 of the crisis.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSince I published my article at 6 am yesterday morning, a number of current and former Bureau of the Fiscal Service officials have reached out and unfortunately confirmed the accuracy of my reporting. Both in my understanding of the technical situation and the extreme dangers that the access which had been reported up to that point. All thought read only access was extraordinarily dangerous to the country. Unfortunately, my sources also tell me that the subsequent anonymous sources mainstream journalists reported who worked to downplay the situation are not accurate.\n\nWired beat me to the punch of reporting that a top DOGE employee, 25 year old former SpaceX employee Marko Elez, has not only read but write access to BFS servers. What can I say, I had to sleep and my sources messaged me after I was asleep. Their article is entitled “A 25-Year-Old With Elon Musk Ties Has Direct Access to the Federal Payment System”, my sources have also independently (and before publication of the Wire article at 1 AM today) confirmed their reporting that:\n\nTwo of those sources say that Elez’s privileges include the ability not just to read but to write code on two of the most sensitive systems in the US government: The Payment Automation Manager (PAM) and Secure Payment System (SPS) at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). Housed on a top-secret mainframe, these systems control, on a granular level, government payments that in their totality amount to more than a fifth of the US economy. [...]\n\nTypically, those admin privileges could give someone the power to log into servers through secure shell access, navigate the entire file system, change user permissions, and delete or modify critical files. That could allow someone to bypass the security measures of, and potentially cause irreversible changes to, the very systems they have access to. [...]\n\n\"Technically I don't see why this couldn't happen,\" a federal IT worker tells WIRED in a phone call late on Monday night, referring to the possibility of a DOGE employee being granted elevated access to a government server. \"If you would have asked me a week ago, I'd have told you that this kind of thing would never in a million years happen. But now, who the fuck knows.\"\n\nAll of this is absolutely true according to my sources.\n\nAdditionally, I can exclusively report that while there was initial hesitation from “IT Leadership” to give them access, they relented. However, they still believed this was extremely risky with one member of leadership saying “I’ve never done anything like this before”, according to a source familiar with the situation. A current IT employee of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service told me “This level of unchecked access is critically dangerous to the economy and the government”. When I replied “this is terrifying” to being informed that they have “write access” this source replied “Yeah it's not good. Read privileges on its own still would have left room for catastrophe, but read and write is apocalyptic.”\n\nSubscribe\n\nIt is as of yet unclear whether anyone on the Payment Automation Manager (PAM) system or the “Secured Payment System” (SPS) have been put on “paid administrative leave”, coerced into resigning or quit in protest. All that is known is that Marko can “access and query” SPS and that there was someone who gave Marko a “tour” of the facilities. We do not know where they are in operationalizing any control. One senior IT source can see Mark retrieving “close to a thousand rows of data” but they can’t see the content because the system is “top secret” even to them. No source I have has knowledge of what DOGE is doing with the data they are retrieving. \n\nOne source states that IT is “mostly intact” but expects that to change as the return to work mandate comes into effect and/or DOGE starts doing even worse things. To be clear, IT is separate from the COBOL programmers who work specifically on these legacy systems. There have certainly been some number of “less than voluntary” resignations similar to Fiscal Assistant Secretary Lebryk. The only outright firings were of the Economic Equality and Opportunity team which one source found “insanely concerning” since that desegregation and anti-discrimination office has been in every federal agency since 1965. The war on “DEI” in the Federal Government is really a war to rollback desegregation and anti-discrimination protections created by the Civil Rights Acts and is not simply some attack on 2010s non-profit trends as it is often portrayed as. But that’s a whole other story.\n\nOne source explicitly said that they were only reporting to me because there was no one left in the Federal Government to report security breaches to:\n\nI do not wish to harm my agency in any way. I loved working here. We did some of the most important work in the country and barely anyone knew who we were. In normal times, I would report insider threats to the appropriate security channels inside the government- but there is no one left for me to report it to.\n\nThus, my sources have unfortunately confirmed many of my worst fears about this situation.\n\nSubscribe\n\nI would also like to clarify some confusion on social media. The issue with understanding and grasping a COBOL system is not knowing COBOL, as a programming language, in the abstract. Nor is it, god help me, something that AI can “do” because you fired one of these chatbots up and got some code that could compile when you asked “write me some COBOL code”. The issue is understanding the specific physical limitations of the system, the way that it interacts with the “Business Logic” of the code and a million other contextual factors. \n\nThere is specific code which tells you where to direct specific payments in specific ways and the structures, and why they are structured the way they are, requires deep contextual knowledge. This is “business logic”. The entire issue with COBOL and why it has been such a struggle to maintain it is that COBOL systems (both private and public) developed for decades with very little documentation, have a million different path dependent coding choices. Mar Hicks 2020 article in Logic Magazine “Built to Last” is worth a read on this topic.\n\nThis is what I meant yesterday when I referenced that 30 different COBOL systems at Treasury had developed their own “dialects” and they launched Payment Application Modernization (PAM), which among other things, unified them. What they unified was the business logic of those systems (as well as likely other factors, most notably the physical architecture of the systems they ran on). Part of me wishes they didn’t modernize with PAM because those 30 different and distinct systems would have been more secure from their infiltration. PAM processed 4.7 trillion dollars of payments in 2024.\n\nIt's also true that some similar issues can emerge with other more recent programming languages and the way “business logic” emerges if a mission critical IT system developed using a more recent programming language. But COBOL is unique; after all it's literally “common business-oriented language”. So while knowing the COBOL programming language is better than not knowing it, it does not make that much of a difference with these young Musk programmers mucking about. \n\nLarge established businesses and governments do not have a “COBOL programmer” shortage. They have a “COBOL programmer with experience in legacy business or government IT systems” shortage. There’s a reason that the vast majority of legacy IT COBOL programmers had no objection to me using “knowing COBOL” as a shorthand for all this. They do not think of “COBOL” as just the programming language in the abstract, but all these contexts. This miscommunication and difference in mindset is why there is so much mutual misunderstanding between legacy IT programmers and the modern tech industry. The misunderstanding is primarily on the modern tech industry’s part. \n\nWe are in such a catastrophic situation I do not have the words to describe. It is getting worse and very little is being done. Lawsuits have been launched to stop this on privacy grounds, but we need so much more. Strongly worded letters from congress are not enough. There is a protest at the Treasury today. This is not a newsletter to tell you how to organize or engage in political action. But wherever you are, whatever your context, get involved in resisting the Trump’s administration’s catastrophic lawlessness and destruction. And get the word out about the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025, which is the crisis above all the crises happening concurrently. I wish my newsletter’s name were a little less literally true right now.\n\n\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><em>If you are a <strong>current or former career Bureau of the Fiscal Service Employee</strong>, especially if you’re a legacy IT programmer with years of experience<strong> and especially if you are a COBOL programmer currently working on the PAM, SPS or any other adjacent team,</strong> contact me </em><a href=\"mailto:crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><em><u>over email</u></em></a><em> or over signal — </em><a href=\"https://signal.me/?ref=crisesnotes.com#eu/TJspTqx16dD39zG7EKpRYYli9_GTNen7cEL7sAug9gdsPRAdW41JzIywiy5y3lXF\"><em><u>linked here</u></em></a><em>.

The abbreviated version of this article is in Rolling Stone\n\nSubscribe\n\nIn my last piece I described the Trump administration’s spending freeze, even with the OMB memo rescinded, as a “five alarm fire” and as a burgeoning “constitutional crisis.” I claimed that it was the “most dramatic event in the constitutional law of fiscal policy in the United States ever.” I said that “Ordinary Americans are now in danger of learning a lot more about the ‘legal plumbing’ of fiscal policy; far more than they could ever imagine wanting to know. Things aren’t going well.” I’m sure to some readers, these statements came off as “alarmist.” \n\nAs it turns out, I understated the extremity and danger of the situation we’re in even as a Judge on Friday issued a more comprehensive injunction against the executive orders which were designed to impound funds, OMB guidance or not, across the federal government. I also understated all the things ordinary Americans are in “danger” of learning about. It's now not just the “legal plumbing,” it's the payments plumbing too. This is now also the closest thing we’ve ever had to a payment system constitutional crisis.\n\nSo what happened? According to reporting on Friday — first at the Washington Post and then in more detail from CNN as well as the New York Times — the Fiscal Assistant Secretary of the United States Treasury David Lebryk has been put on paid administrative leave and plans to resign after refusing to give Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) access to the operational details of the Treasury’s payment system and the data it processes. In particular, Musk’s DOGE team has been asking for what the New York Times reporting refers to as “source code information” since December and has been rebuffed. The CNN reporting specifically states that they were inquiring about the technical ability to stop payments.\n\nDavid Lebryk has been an employee at the United States Treasury since 1989 and has been Fiscal Assistant Treasury Secretary since 2014, which is the highest position a civil service employee can reach; everyone above him is a political appointee. Donald Trump named Lebryk acting Treasury Secretary while his nominee Scott Bessent went through the nominations process; as of this writing Lebryk is still listed on the Treasury’s website as the acting Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. His understanding of the operational systems that undergird the functioning of the United States Treasury is far and away unparalleled. In particular, he is widely credited with being the person who is overwhelmingly responsible for the undisrupted continuity of cash inflows and outflows at the Treasury during the recurrent debt ceiling crises of the past 15 years while concurrently ensuring the debt ceiling limit was not breached.\n\nLebryk being put on paid administrative leave reportedly happened after he requested and got a meeting with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, fresh from his confirmation by the Senate. Bessent’s full willingness to cooperate with DOGE’s desire to access the operational aspects of the Treasury’s payment system, even to the point of overruling Lebryk, is an extremely shocking development. It implies a level of willingness to serve Trump’s interests that has not previously been understood by Congress, Wall Street, or corporate America at-large. \n\nHowever, this is consistent with internal conversations among those in the president’s orbit. I can exclusively report here for the first time that Scott Bessent was advised that what Donald Trump wanted in a Treasury Secretary was a person who would have the credibility Steve Mnuchin had with Wall Street but who would be loyal to Trump above all other considerations, according to two sources familiar with the situation. This included, but was not limited to, unconditionally agreeing to work with whomever Trump sent over to the Treasury Department and helping go after Donald Trump’s enemies. In the context of Bessent’s actions this week, and what Elon Musk and DOGE want from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, these commitments take on a dark new meaning. \n\nSubscribe\n\nThe danger is also not in the near future, it is here. Follow up reporting from the New York Times Saturday evening in an article straightforwardly informed readers in its headline that “Elon Musk’s Team Now Has Full Access to Treasury’s Payments System.” They could not initially confirm that any payments had yet been stopped but an updated version had further information that seemed intended by anonymous government officials to reassure people. Most notably, the New York Times took the word “full” out of the headline:\n\nWhile their access was approved, the Musk representatives have yet to gain operational capabilities and no government payments have been blocked, the people said.\n\nMr. Musk’s initiative is intended to be part of a broader review of the payments system to allow improper payments to be scrutinized and is not an effort to arbitrarily block individual payments, the people familiar with the matter said. Career Treasury Department attorneys signed off on granting the access, they added, and any changes to the system would go through a review process and testing.\n\nFor reasons I will go into below, I do believe that it is the case that Musk and his team are not yet near having “operational capabilities.” The key word is “yet.”\n\nHowever, I find the Times reporters willingness to uncritically repeat Musk’s stated rationale for operational access extremely troubling and certainly unconvincing. I do not think Musk’s stated rationale has any additional credibility because it was repeated by anonymous Treasury officials. It's important to understand that “improper” is in the eye of the beholder, and the danger of operational access to the payments system is precisely that there are very little safeguards for its improper use or manipulation. It turns out that the greatest barrier was David Lebryk, and he was shunted aside at the direct order of the White House. We also have no idea what circumstances, or even if it is true, that “Career Treasury Department attorneys signed off.” It’s also far-fetched they aren’t pursuing using this to block payments since the impoundment constitutional crisis has not been resolved. They absolutely can shut down payments from a disfavored agency even if they can’t shut down “individual” payments operationally.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubsequent reporting from Politico and the Wall Street Journal had more plausible details. The Wall Street Journal states:\n\nA person familiar with the arrangement said DOGE representatives won’t have direct authority to stop individual payments or make other changes, describing their access as “read only.” Bessent approved the arrangement on the condition that the DOGE representatives’ activity be documented and monitored. \n\nTom Krause, a Musk ally and the chief executive at Cloud Software Group, led the discussions with Treasury over the arrangement, the person said. Krause, who is working with DOGE, is among those expected to gain access to the system.\n\nThus, the “comforting” narrative here is that Elon Musk’s representative, who now is technically a Treasury employee as well, has allegedly not been granted unconditional access. However, the point of “read only” access is to make changes through understanding the code. There is no reason to think at this moment that DOGE’s proposed modifications would be resisted by Scott Bessent. Until new information emerges the best sign of what’s going on is Lebryk being forced out. It will take much more evidence of an ironclad legal review process before I am convinced otherwise (to say the least). The internal treasury payments systems must function correctly; it just also matters what purposes it is being designed for. \n\nMusk and his cronies are clearly aiming to redesign the payments system to serve their agenda. The most chilling sentence is this one from the Wall Street Journal:\n\nIt couldn’t be determined what DOGE representatives intended to do with their access to the payment system. Musk and his team think the payment system should be overseen by political appointees selected by President Trump, the people said.\n\nThis is not the attitude of people who are trying to simply technocratically make the payment system more “efficient.” They have a very clear and specific agenda, which involves unilaterally cutting spending, particularly spending they perceive to be going to their ideological foes. Is “Wokeness,” the “Green New Deal,” “Marxism,” and “Gender Ideology” going to be the new definition of an “improper payment\"?\n\nWhich brings me back to the Constitutional Crisis. As I published on Friday Morning, this was already a constitutional crisis because the Trump administration was claiming sweeping powers to impound spending, pulling the purse-strings away from Congress and towards itself. The executive orders were shock-enforced with a sudden Office of Management Budget memo last Monday with the deadline for implementation being 24 hours later. The vagueness and sweeping nature of the order led to payment portals going down across the Federal Government. The backlash got the OMB memo rescinded, but not the executive orders. There are now multiple court injunctions.\n\nSubscribe\n\nIt is crucial to understand that while this was already very bad, it is not as bad as it could have been. Online web-based payment portals went down because agencies either took them down themselves or directed the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to do so while they figured out how they were going to deal with the OMB guidance. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s job is to keep the payments system functioning and they follow what agencies tell them to do, within the scope of the law as they understand it. If someone commits fraud, it's law enforcement or the agencies themselves job to catch it before or after a payment is made. \n\nWhich brings me to this idea that operational access to the Treasury’s payment system is about “improper payments.” Musk took to Twitter at 1:52 AM on Saturday to frame David Lebryk’s “resignation” around a supposed shock that the Bureau of the Fiscal Service fulfills all valid payment orders that it gets from administrative agencies. His exact statement was:\n\nThe @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. \n\nThey literally never denied a payment in their entire career. \n\nNot even once.\n\nIt is of course not the case that they approve payments to “known fraudulent or terrorist groups.” It is true that greater matching between specific data across the federal government, as well as state and local governments, would reduce improper payments before they become valid payment orders processed by the Treasury.\n\nThe Bureau of the Fiscal Service has a “payments integrity unit” which works with agencies to reduce improper payments, and the BFS offered no less than five legislative proposals in its fiscal year 2024 report for improving the payments system and reducing improper payments. These proposals focus precisely on greater access to datasets across government (and credit reporting data) as well as giving the Treasury greater authority to require agencies to engage in bank-account matching in order to reduce improper payments. Note that they are legislative proposals because these require statutory authorization and cannot legally be done unilaterally. They would also cost money to enact, which requires appropriations. Conversely, if an agency is illegally not paying someone who should be paid, it is the responsibility of the Judiciary, Congress or oversight bodies in the executive branch to deal with this problem. \n\nIt’s also important to understand that “improper payment” does not simply mean “fraud.” There are a multitude of reasons for why over or underpayments can happen. The main issue is improving internal controls at agencies, increasing agency funding so they can do a better job with this and delegate less administration to entities like state governments. Indeed among the “highest risk” programs for improper payments are programs where individual benefits are administered at the state level. In the 2024 fiscal year the Treasury’s internal payments system processed 1.4 billion payments with an aggregate monetary value of $5.4 trillion. This is 88 percent of the total payments the federal government makes. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service is the pulsating payments heart of the entire federal government. The point is not to pick and choose at this level, just as you don’t screen which apartment buildings are connected to sewer and water lines based on “suspicious activity reports” about their occupants.  \n\nIt is not the job of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to do the due diligence others were supposed to with a tiny staff that has an enormous task. Nor is discretionarily stopping payments at the operational payments level remotely consistent with even the barest minimum standard of due process of law. What their job is is to serve as a payments intermediary between the rest of the Federal Government and the wider payments system by routing payments to recipients through the Federal Reserve and onto the banking system. This BFS “user training” powerpoint for the “Automated Standard Application for Payments,” for example, has a helpful guide to how this works with some useful diagrams.\n\nThis is the absolutely crucial part. Without political control of the payment's heart, the Trump administration and Elon Musk must chase down every agency and bend it to their will. They are in the process of doing that, but bureaucrats can notionally continue to respect the law and resist their efforts. They are helped in this effort by court injunctions they can point to. This is bureaucratic trench warfare. But if Musk and Trump can reach into the choke point, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, they could possibly not need agency cooperation. They can just impound agency payments themselves. They could also possibly stop paying federal employees they have forced on paid administrative leave, coercing them to resign. These possibilities are what every Treasury expert I’ve talked to instantly thought of the moment they read the Washington Post reporting and are incredibly alarmed about.\n\nSubscribe\n\nWhich brings me to why legislative changes are needed to modify the data the Bureau of the Fiscal Service collects. The central reason is privacy. The data the Treasury collects could not possibly be more sensitive. We are talking about hundreds of millions of Social Security numbers, as well as a raft of other specific identifying information. In fact, the Privacy Impact Statements (PIAs) on the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s website are the best way an outsider can find out information about how the Treasury’s internal payment system works in general. I have gotten into looking at Private Impact Statements over the past year in order to find information I could FOIA. Social Security payments, among many others, flow through the “Secured Payment System” (SPS).\n\nLet's return to the “Automated Standard Application for Payments” (ASAP) for a second to examine its Privacy Impact Statement. ASAP specifically allows agencies to send funds to “state and local governments, educational and financial institutions, vendors and contractors, profit and non-profit entities and Indian tribal organizations.” This system collects between “10,000 – 99,999” social security numbers along with identifying “business” information, including sensitive financial records and “business” bank accounts. Does anyone think that if Musk could get his hands on this information, whether directly or indirectly, he would not use it to go after, say, nonprofits he dislikes? At 3:14am Sunday, Musk pledged to shut down \"illegal payments\" to Global Refuge, a faith-based organization that exists to provide \"safety and support to refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants from across the world.\" Musk messing with ASAP is no hypothetical at all.\n\nCrucially, the PIA form asks this question:\n\nIs it possible that Treasury will share information maintained in the system or by the project with a third party external to the Department that will use the information to make an adverse determination about an individual’s rights, benefits, and privileges under federal programs? [Emphasis added]\n\nThe form documenting ASAP marks “no.” In many ways, the United States functions — to the extent it functions — because across hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Privacy Impact Statements agencies answer this question “no” and then follow through — for the most part — on this answer. If people come to believe that any information they provide the Federal Government will be a token granting Donald Trump and Elon Musk greater power over them, a multitude of essential functions will fall apart.\n\nTo someone like Musk, I think the idea that there is information held on Treasury or other governmental servers which could theoretically be used to uncover “improper payments” or other such alleged irregularities and this information cannot be used because of legal privacy protections will make no sense. He will rail on about how he’s trying to stop “fraud” but the “deep state” won’t let him. The best of the Federal Government comes when civil service employees maintain and defend privacy against the parts of the government which wants to abuse this information against our interests. The Civil Service does not always live up to that, especially when congress passes laws that encroach on privacy and mandate or allow the use of governmental data against us. But it remains heroic when people like David Lebryk get in the way of that, especially when it means being pushed out of government.\n\nIn some ways, as enormously alarming at this all is, it’s somehow not the biggest concern that I have been thinking about. For the past 36 hours (writing these words at Midnight on Saturday) my mind has returned over and over to the idea that they have been asking for “source code information” to the Treasury’s internal payments system. The concept of Elon Musk asking for the Treasury payments system’s “source code” would make any veteran of legacy mission critical IT laugh hysterically, and  then perhaps weep. \n\nSubscribe\n\nAnyone who knows or has known computer programmers of mission critical legacy IT systems can tell you about the stories of rafts of consultants who have come and gone attempting to understand how the system works so they can “modernize” it on the cheap. The vast majority of the time these consultants are either not able to do what they promise or are honest about the cost of updating the system without a mission critical system “going down,” leading management to balk. The modernization of the United States Treasury’s legacy IT systems was started almost 20 years ago with Payment Application Modernization (PAM). The scale and difficulty of this can be judged by reading the description of the… Post Payment Modernization Initiative (PPMI):\n\nThe purpose of the Post Payment Modernization Initiative (PPMI) application is to consolidate all post-payment processing into one comprehensive application by merging processing currently performed by multiple legacy systems. The consolidation of post payment systems will reduce costs associated with operations & maintenance of legacy systems, reduce duplicative functionality, eliminate redundancy of data across systems & provide a single source for post payment processing for Treasury Disbursed Federal agencies. Initial Production Deployment of the PPMI application will be used to run in parallel with the legacy systems PPMI will be consolidating. [Emphasis added]\n\nIn other words, they are doing the payments modernization after the payments modernization and this second phase is still ongoing. And who knows if there would be a third phase.\n\nIt’s hard to get good information on the exact state of play of the treasury payments system’s IT modernization. The clearest indication actually comes from a September 2024 press release about the IRS: \n\nFor 65 years, the IRS has relied on the same foundational technology for many of its critical systems, including the Individual Master File (IMF), which houses taxpayer data and feeds into key systems. The core technology, based on ALC and COBOL coding, has become a liability due to the diminishing pool of experts proficient in this legacy language.\n\nThe IRS has reached a critical milestone in modernizing a core technology component of the Individual Master File, by porting the outdated Assembly-based codebase to Java, a more modern, more sustainable language. Reflecting the agency’s focus on technology best practices, this new system, Integrated Tax Processing Engine (ITPE), is now running simultaneously with IMF to verify accuracy of its data processing. The system's data will be hosted in the Enterprise Data Platform, a modern, cloud-based system for managing data.\n\nTo translate, this is a press release celebrating moving some of the IRS’ systems off Assembly, a mainframe coding language invented in 1947. \n\nSubscribe\n\nCOBOL is the lingua franca of mission critical legacy IT in use since the 1960s and too many systems have been too important to abandon it. “Modernization” has instead been built around making COBOL function somewhere besides a mainframe. The “modernization” of the Treasury’s IT payments infrastructure seems to have constituted a combination of rooting out Assembly code and a basically completed transition of “mainframe” COBOL to an “internally-developed RM COBOL” running on Linux servers. RM COBOL is an update on mainframe COBOL “designed for optimum performance and wide portability across a broad diversity of computers and operating systems.” Most notably, the Treasury’s transition to RM COBOL seems to have involved harmonizing more than 30 different COBOL systems which had evolved separately. It was 30 “dialects” they managed to get to speak one standardized language. \n\nDoes Elon Musk understand any of this? Does he have any grasp of the scale and complexity he is trying to reach into and exercise “influence”? Currently the most urgent and profound danger is not what he intends to make this sprawling apparatus do. The most immediate danger is what might break in the process of trying to get this apparatus to do what he wants.  \n\nAt every step of modernizing this system they have run systems concurrently to make sure the “new” functions as well as the old. Redundant systems are only phased out over long time periods after they have enough data on system functioning to feel confident in the “modernized” infrastructure. This is expensive, time consuming and absolutely necessary to make sure this system functions 100% of the time. Elon Musk, however, has never shown respect or understanding of the concept of a mission critical IT system. All he sees is “inefficiency” because he doesn’t understand that there are some things in this world that need to function no matter what and you spend the additional money to make sure it runs, including when it's being updated. \n\nThis is ultimately not that big a deal when it comes to Twitter — Twitter can go down for a few hours, even a few days. Its function can degrade over time and the website can become less and less usable on a gradual — and then maybe eventually sudden — way down. A worse disruption would be more painful, but ultimately not a crisis for the world. The same cannot be said about the complex and sprawling legacy IT systems and administrative apparatus which make sure that Treasury payments go out, are on time and never fail. To put that another way, the same cannot be said about the system that makes sure the federal government is able to make payments reliably and on time. \n\nIt's also important to state that the number of people who comprehensively understand these legacy IT systems can likely be counted on two hands — and that may be optimistic. It is already a threat to their Mission Critical nature for David Lebryk to be forced out of the Federal Government by Elon Musk. Lebryk, who first joined the Treasury Department in 1989 and slowly worked his way up until he was its highest ranking non-political appointee, is clearly the person on earth who understands this IT apparatus the best. Having known his equivalents on far smaller and less important scales in other legacy IT systems, I can tell you that there are certainly things about this IT system that he knows and no one else does. \n\nFurthermore, it's possible that he is the only person on earth that fully understands how all the many components of how these sprawling legacy IT systems — really a legacy IT “network” — fits together and interacts. I’m sure the knowledge of the remaining career service professionals at the Treasury can combine their understanding to approximate most of Lebryk’s knowledge, but there is a reason you have and value someone like Lebryk in the first place. Companies have spent millions of dollars hiring back such people to fix mission critical IT systems of far, far less importance. \n\nI try to keep emotion out of this newsletter. I have always tried to write Notes on the Crises in a calm, detached tone so that the information I highlight shines through. However, I must be honest with readers: I’m absolutely terrified. When I first read the Washington Post’s reporting I subsequently had a panic attack. I am not subject to those. I didn’t have one during the start of Covid-19 when I started writing about the full health, economic, and political consequences in March 2020 and knew before many, many people that millions would die. Nor at any time subsequently did I have one. Even as someone who has spent an unusual amount of time thinking about the Treasury’s internal payments system for a person who has never been in government, I find grasping the full implications of Elon Musk and his apparatchiks reaching into and trying to exert full control over the Treasury’s payment system mind-boggling. \n\nThere is nothing more important on the entire planet than getting Elon Musk and DOGE out of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service and allowing career civil service employees to run the Treasury’s internal payments system without capricious and self-serving interference from billionaires and their allies. This effort must fail if we are to safeguard any semblance of due process and lawfulness in the executive branch. A vague anonymous promise that DOGE only has “read only” access is not enough. They need to be rooted out so that we can return to the slower moving, less dangerous, “five alarm fire” constitutional crisis we were having as of Friday morning.\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><em>If you are a <strong>current or former career </strong>“<strong>civil service</strong>”<strong> Treasury or Federal Reserve System employee,</strong> including in the general counsel’s offices of either entity, and you have detailed knowledge of how the Bureau of Fiscal Service operates at an operational level please contact me </em><a href=\"mailto:crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><em><u>over email</u></em></a><em> or over signal — </em><a href=\"https://signal.me/?ref=crisesnotes.com#eu/TJspTqx16dD39zG7EKpRYYli9_GTNen7cEL7sAug9gdsPRAdW41JzIywiy5y3lXF\"><em><u>linked here</u></em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>This is a free piece of Notes on the Crises.

In the context of Bessent’s actions this week, and what Elon Musk and DOGE want from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, these commitments take on a dark new meaning.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>The danger is also not in the near future, it is here. Follow up reporting from the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-federal-payments-system.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>New York Times Saturday evening</u></a> in an article straightforwardly informed readers in its headline that “Elon Musk’s Team Now Has Full Access to Treasury’s Payments System.” They could not initially confirm that any payments had yet been stopped but an updated version had further information that seemed intended by anonymous government officials to reassure people. Most notably, the New York Times took the word “full” out of the headline:</p><blockquote>While their access was approved, the Musk representatives have <strong>yet to gain operational capabilities and no government payments have been blocked</strong>, the people said.</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Musk’s initiative is intended to be part of a broader review of the payments system to <strong>allow improper payments to be scrutinized</strong> and is <strong>not an effort to arbitrarily block individual payments, the people familiar with the matter said</strong>. Career Treasury Department attorneys signed off on granting the access, they added, and any changes to the system would go through a review process and testing.</blockquote><p>For reasons I will go into below, I do believe that it is the case that Musk and his team are not yet near having “operational capabilities.” The key word is “yet.”</p><p>However, I find the Times reporters willingness to uncritically repeat Musk’s stated rationale for operational access extremely troubling and certainly unconvincing. I do not think Musk’s stated rationale has any additional credibility because it was repeated by anonymous Treasury officials. It's important to understand that “improper” is in the eye of the beholder, and the danger of operational access to the payments system is precisely that there are very little safeguards for its improper use or manipulation. It turns out that the greatest barrier was David Lebryk, and he was shunted aside at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-federal-payments-system.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the direct order of the White House</u></a>. We also have no idea what circumstances, or even if it is true, that “Career Treasury Department attorneys signed off.” It’s also far-fetched they aren’t pursuing using this to block payments since the impoundment constitutional crisis has not been resolved. They absolutely can shut down payments from a disfavored agency even if they can’t <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/overseer-of-federal-payments-system-leaves-treasury-in-trump-era?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>shut down “individual” payments operationally</u></a>.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Subsequent reporting <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/01/musk-claims-doge-lax-treasury-00201946?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>from Politico</u></a> and the Wall Street Journal had more plausible details. The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/elon-musks-doge-getting-access-to-payment-system-that-doles-out-trillions-to-americans-5625adf0?st=EurALG&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Wall Street Journal states</u></a>:</p><blockquote>A person familiar with the arrangement said DOGE representatives won’t have direct authority to stop individual payments or make other changes, describing their access as “read only.” Bessent approved the arrangement on the condition that the DOGE representatives’ activity be documented and monitored.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Tom Krause, a Musk ally and the chief executive at Cloud Software Group, led the discussions with Treasury over the arrangement, the person said. Krause, who is working with DOGE, is among those expected to gain access to the system.</blockquote><p>Thus, the “comforting” narrative here is that Elon Musk’s representative, who now is technically <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/david-lebryk-treasury-resigns-musk.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>a Treasury employee</u></a> as well, has allegedly not been granted unconditional access. However, the point of “read only” access is to make changes through understanding the code. There is no reason to think at this moment that DOGE’s proposed modifications would be resisted by Scott Bessent. Until new information emerges the best sign of what’s going on is Lebryk being forced out. It will take much more evidence of an ironclad legal review process before I am convinced otherwise (to say the least). The internal treasury payments systems must <strong>function correctly</strong>; it just also matters what purposes it is being <strong>designed for</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Musk and his cronies are clearly aiming to redesign the payments system to serve their agenda. The most chilling sentence is this one from <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/elon-musks-doge-getting-access-to-payment-system-that-doles-out-trillions-to-americans-5625adf0?st=EurALG&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the Wall Street Journal</u></a>: </p><blockquote>It couldn’t be determined what DOGE representatives intended to do with their access to the payment system. Musk and his team think the payment system <strong>should be overseen by political appointees selected by President Trump</strong>, the people said.</blockquote><p>This is not the attitude of people who are trying to simply technocratically make the payment system more “efficient.” They have a very clear and specific agenda, which involves unilaterally cutting spending, particularly spending they perceive to be going to their ideological foes. Is “Wokeness,” the “Green New Deal,” “Marxism,” and “Gender Ideology” going to be the new definition of an “improper payment\"?</p><p>Which brings me back to the Constitutional Crisis. <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>As I published on Friday Morning</u></a>, this was already a constitutional crisis because the Trump administration was claiming sweeping powers to impound spending, pulling the purse-strings away from Congress and towards itself. The executive orders were shock-enforced with a sudden Office of Management Budget memo last Monday with the deadline for implementation being 24 hours later. The vagueness and sweeping nature of the order led to payment portals going down across the Federal Government. The backlash got the OMB memo rescinded, but not the executive orders. There are now multiple court injunctions.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>It is crucial to understand that while this was already very bad, it is not <strong>as bad</strong> as it could have been. Online web-based payment portals went down because agencies either took them down themselves or directed the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to do so while they figured out how they were going to deal with the OMB guidance. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s job is to keep the payments system functioning and they follow what agencies tell them to do, within the scope of the law as they understand it. If someone commits fraud, it's law enforcement or the agencies themselves job to catch it before or after a payment is made.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfu2vCS-XHvtO8dfa7RUu1bvoSC6-53fGV3s0aM0xaJe-ZyxcXBEPoHCPonSKBmlkeNI4vOwiPIGKsxtTE58w2lT6qx8BFsSGmh9qgH8LtqZY--UAz9GWnHb_CxzV5XIXohpXU-sg?key=QA6wVkEWKRJl8cVUW10WZ7Wo\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"450\" height=\"743\"></figure><p>Which brings me to this idea that operational access to the Treasury’s payment system is about “improper payments.” Musk took to Twitter at 1:52 AM on Saturday to frame David Lebryk’s “resignation” around a supposed shock that the Bureau of the Fiscal Service fulfills all valid payment orders that it gets from administrative agencies. His exact <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1885582076247712229?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>statement was</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>They literally never denied a payment in their entire career.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Not even once.</blockquote><p>It is of course not the case that they approve payments to “known fraudulent or terrorist groups.” It is true that greater matching between specific data across the federal government, as well as state and local governments, would reduce improper payments <strong>before they become valid payment orders processed by the Treasury.</strong></p><p>The Bureau of the Fiscal Service has a<strong> “payments integrity unit”</strong> which works with agencies to reduce improper payments, and the BFS offered no less than <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/15.-FiscalService-FY2024-BIB.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>five legislative proposals in its fiscal year 2024 report</u></a> for improving the payments system and reducing improper payments. These proposals focus precisely on greater access to datasets across government (and credit reporting data) as well as giving the Treasury greater authority to require agencies to engage in bank-account matching in order to reduce improper payments. Note that they are <strong>legislative proposals</strong> because these require statutory authorization and cannot legally be done unilaterally. They would also cost money to enact, which requires appropriations. Conversely, if an agency is illegally not paying someone who should be paid, it is the responsibility of the Judiciary, Congress or oversight bodies in the executive branch to deal with this problem.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also important to understand that <strong>“improper payment” </strong><a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/830/820358.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><strong><u>does not simply mean “fraud.”</u></strong></a> There are a multitude of reasons for why over or underpayments can happen. The main issue is improving internal controls at agencies, increasing agency funding so they can do a better job with this and delegate less administration to entities like state governments. Indeed among the “highest risk” programs for improper payments <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/830/820358.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>are programs where individual benefits are administered at the state level</u></a>. In the 2024 fiscal year the Treasury’s internal payments system <strong>processed 1.4 billion payments with an aggregate monetary value of $5.4 trillion. </strong>This is 88 percent of the total payments the federal government makes. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service is the pulsating payments heart of the entire federal government. The point is <strong>not to pick and choose at this level</strong>, just as you don’t screen which apartment buildings are connected to sewer and water lines based on “suspicious activity reports” about their occupants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is not the job of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to do the due diligence others were supposed to with a tiny staff that has an enormous task. Nor is discretionarily stopping payments at the operational payments level remotely consistent with even the barest minimum standard of due process of law. What their job is is to serve as a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/banks-as-payment-plumbing-monetary/\"><u>payments intermediary</u></a> between the rest of the Federal Government and the wider payments system by routing payments to recipients through the Federal Reserve and onto the banking system. This <a href=\"https://archive.ph/ChM4l?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>BFS “user training” powerpoint</u></a> for the “Automated Standard Application for Payments,” for example, has a helpful guide to how this works with some useful diagrams. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfcERyUfV7jc3kCVzhAqDwcvhChpQmdANjUQXYc3qcfOO-mocY0IgEedMW96JhH540P4MXEm7Ty-ML54s8ql8156LpzauHYcyBLTnOUyiiJE8LyYkhMeMBWS89QN9nZjhvn9Ld0?key=QA6wVkEWKRJl8cVUW10WZ7Wo\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"313\"></figure><p>This is the absolutely <strong>crucial part. </strong>Without political control of the payment's heart, the Trump administration and Elon Musk must chase down every agency and bend it to their will. They are in the process of doing that, but bureaucrats can notionally continue to respect the law and resist their efforts. They are helped in this effort by court injunctions they can point to. This is bureaucratic trench warfare. But if Musk and Trump can reach into the choke point, the<strong> Bureau of the Fiscal Service,</strong> they could possibly <strong>not need</strong> agency cooperation. They can just <strong>impound agency payments themselves</strong>. They could also possibly <strong>stop paying federal employees they have forced on paid administrative leave, coercing them to resign</strong>. These possibilities are what every Treasury expert I’ve talked to instantly thought of the moment they read the Washington Post reporting and are incredibly alarmed about.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Which brings me to <strong>why</strong> legislative changes are needed to modify the data the Bureau of the Fiscal Service collects. The central reason is <strong>privacy</strong>. The data the Treasury collects could not possibly <strong>be more sensitive.</strong> We are talking about hundreds<strong> of millions of Social Security numbers, as well as a raft of other specific identifying information</strong>. In fact, the <a href=\"https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/pia.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Privacy Impact Statements (PIAs)</u></a> on the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s website are the best way an outsider can find out information about how the Treasury’s internal payment system works in general. I have gotten into looking at Private Impact Statements over the past year in order to find information I could FOIA. Social Security payments, among many others, flow through <a href=\"https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/files/pia/spspclia.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the “Secured Payment System” (SPS)</u></a>.</p><p>Let's return to the “Automated Standard Application for Payments” (ASAP) for a second to <a href=\"https://archive.ph/gJRL7?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>examine its Privacy Impact Statement</u></a>. ASAP specifically allows agencies to <a href=\"https://fiscal.treasury.gov/asap/?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">send funds to</a> “state and local governments, educational and financial institutions, vendors and contractors, profit and non-profit entities and Indian tribal organizations.” This system collects between “10,000 – 99,999” social security numbers along with identifying “business” information, including sensitive financial records and “business” bank accounts. Does anyone think that if Musk could get his hands on this information, whether directly or indirectly, he would not use it to go after, say, nonprofits he dislikes? At <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1885964969335808217?s=46&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>3:14am Sunday, Musk pledged</u></a> to shut down \"illegal payments\" to <a href=\"https://2023.globalrefuge.org/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Global Refuge</u></a>, a faith-based organization that exists to provide \"safety and support to refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants from across the world.\" Musk messing with ASAP is no hypothetical at all.</p><p>Crucially, the PIA form asks this question:</p><blockquote>Is it possible that Treasury will share information maintained in the system or by the project <strong>with a third party external to the Department that will use the information</strong> to make an adverse determination about an individual’s rights, benefits, and privileges under federal programs? [Emphasis added]</blockquote><p>The form documenting ASAP marks “no.” In many ways, the United States functions — to the extent it functions — because across hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Privacy Impact Statements agencies answer this question “no” and then follow through — for the most part — on this answer. If people come to believe that any information they provide the Federal Government will be a token granting Donald Trump and Elon Musk greater power over them, a multitude of essential functions will fall apart.</p><p>To someone like Musk, I think the idea that there is information held on Treasury or other governmental servers which could theoretically be used to uncover “improper payments” or other such alleged irregularities and this information cannot be used because of legal privacy protections will make no sense. He will rail on about how he’s trying to stop “fraud” but the “deep state” won’t let him. The best of the Federal Government comes when civil service employees maintain and defend privacy against the parts of the government which wants to abuse this information against our interests. The Civil Service does not always live up to that, especially when congress passes laws that encroach on privacy and mandate or allow the use of governmental data against us. But it remains heroic when people like David Lebryk get in the way of that, especially when it means being pushed out of government.</p><p>In some ways, as enormously alarming at this all is, it’s somehow not the biggest concern that I have been thinking about. For the past 36 hours (writing these words at Midnight on Saturday) my mind has returned over and over to the idea that they have been asking for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/david-lebryk-treasury-resigns-musk.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“source code information</u></a>” to the Treasury’s internal payments system. The concept of Elon Musk asking for the Treasury payments system’s “source code” would make any veteran of legacy mission critical IT laugh hysterically, and&nbsp; then perhaps weep.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Anyone who knows or has known computer programmers of mission critical legacy IT systems can tell you about the stories of rafts of consultants who have come and gone attempting to understand how the system works so they can “modernize” it on the cheap. The vast majority of the time these consultants are either not able to do what they promise or are honest about the cost of updating the system without a mission critical system “going down,” leading management to balk. The modernization of the United States Treasury’s legacy IT systems was started almost 20 years ago with <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/10_FMS_CJ_01-22-07_GTG.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Payment Application Modernization (PAM)</u></a>. The scale and difficulty of this can be judged by reading the description of the… <a href=\"https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/files/pia/ppmi-pclia.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Post Payment Modernization Initiative (PPMI)</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The purpose of the Post Payment Modernization Initiative (PPMI) application is to consolidate all post-payment processing into one comprehensive application by<strong> merging processing currently performed by multiple legacy systems</strong>. The consolidation of post payment systems will reduce costs associated with <strong>operations &amp; maintenance of legacy systems, reduce duplicative functionality, eliminate redundancy of data across systems &amp; provide a single source for post payment processing</strong> for Treasury Disbursed Federal agencies. Initial Production Deployment of the PPMI application will be used to run in parallel with the legacy systems PPMI will be consolidating. [Emphasis added]</blockquote><p>In other words, they are doing the payments modernization after the payments modernization and this second phase is still ongoing. And who knows if there would be a third phase.</p><p>It’s hard to get good information on the exact state of play of the treasury payments system’s IT modernization. The clearest indication actually comes from a <a href=\"https://archive.ph/478AG?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>September 2024 press release</u></a> about the IRS:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><strong>For 65 years</strong>, the IRS has relied on the same foundational technology for many of its critical systems, including the Individual Master File (IMF), which houses taxpayer data and feeds into key systems. The core technology, <strong>based on ALC and COBOL coding</strong>, has become a liability due to the <strong>diminishing pool of experts proficient in this legacy language</strong>.</blockquote><blockquote>The IRS has reached a critical milestone in modernizing a core technology component of the Individual Master File, by <strong>porting the outdated Assembly-based codebase to Java</strong>, a more modern, more sustainable language. Reflecting the agency’s focus on technology best practices, this new system, Integrated Tax Processing Engine (ITPE), is now running simultaneously with IMF to verify accuracy of its data processing. The system's data will be hosted in the Enterprise Data Platform, a modern, cloud-based system for managing data.</blockquote><p>To translate, this is a press release celebrating moving <strong>some</strong> of the IRS’ systems off <strong>Assembly, </strong>a mainframe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language?ref=crisesnotes.com#:~:text=In%20computer%20programming%2C%20assembly%20language,the%20language%20and%20the%20architecture's\"><u>coding language invented in 1947</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>COBOL is the lingua franca of mission critical legacy IT in use since the 1960s and too many systems have been too important to abandon it. “Modernization” has instead been built around making COBOL function somewhere besides a mainframe. The “modernization” of the Treasury’s IT payments infrastructure seems to have constituted a combination of rooting out Assembly code and a basically completed transition of “mainframe” COBOL to an <a href=\"https://oig.treasury.gov/system/files/2024-11/oig25005%20%28508%29.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“internally-developed RM COBOL”</u></a> running on Linux servers. <a href=\"https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/rm-cobol/1214/RMC-LRM.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>RM COBOL is an update</u></a> on mainframe COBOL “designed for optimum performance and wide portability across a broad diversity of computers and operating systems.” Most notably, the Treasury’s transition to RM COBOL seems to have involved harmonizing more than 30 different COBOL systems <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/10_FMS_CJ_01-22-07_GTG.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>which had evolved separately</u></a>. It was 30 “dialects” they managed to get to speak one standardized language.&nbsp;</p><p>Does Elon Musk understand any of this? Does he have any grasp of the scale and complexity he is trying to reach into and exercise “influence”? Currently the most urgent and profound danger is not what he intends to make this sprawling apparatus do. The most immediate danger is what might break in the process of <strong>trying</strong> to get <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/overseer-of-federal-payments-system-leaves-treasury-in-trump-era?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>this apparatus to do what he wants</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At every step of modernizing this system they have run systems concurrently to make sure the “new” functions as well as the old. Redundant systems are only phased out over long time periods after they have enough data on system functioning to feel confident in the “modernized” infrastructure. This is expensive, time consuming and absolutely necessary to make sure this system functions 100% of the time. Elon Musk, however, has never shown respect or understanding of the concept of a mission critical IT system. All he sees is “inefficiency” because he doesn’t understand that there are some things in this world that need to function no matter what and you spend the additional money to make sure it runs, including when it's being updated.&nbsp;</p><p>This is ultimately not that big a deal when it comes to Twitter — Twitter can go down for a few hours, even a few days. Its function can degrade over time and the website can become less and less usable on a gradual — and then maybe eventually sudden — way down. A worse disruption would be more painful, but ultimately not a crisis for the world. The same cannot be said about the complex and sprawling legacy IT systems and administrative apparatus which make sure that Treasury payments go out, are on time and never fail. To put that another way, the same cannot be said about the system that makes sure the federal government is able to make payments reliably and on time.&nbsp;</p><p>It's also important to state that the number of people who comprehensively understand these legacy IT systems can likely be counted on two hands — and that may be optimistic. It is already a threat to their Mission Critical nature for David Lebryk to be forced out of the Federal Government by Elon Musk. Lebryk, who first joined the Treasury Department in 1989 and slowly worked his way up until he was its highest ranking non-political appointee, is clearly the person on earth who understands this IT apparatus the best. Having known his equivalents on far smaller and less important scales in other legacy IT systems, I can tell you that there are certainly things about this IT system that he knows and no one else does.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, it's possible that he is the only person on earth that fully understands how all the many components of how these sprawling legacy IT systems — really a legacy IT “network” — fits together and interacts. I’m sure the knowledge of the remaining career service professionals at the Treasury can combine their understanding to approximate most of Lebryk’s knowledge, but there is a reason you have and value someone like Lebryk in the first place. Companies have spent millions of dollars hiring back such people to fix mission critical IT systems of far, far less importance.&nbsp;</p><p>I try to keep emotion out of this newsletter. I have always tried to write <em>Notes on the Crises</em> in a calm, detached tone so that the information I highlight shines through. However, I must be honest with readers: I’m absolutely terrified. When I first read the Washington Post’s reporting I subsequently had a panic attack. I am not subject to those. I didn’t have one during the start of Covid-19 when I started writing about the full health, economic, and political consequences in March 2020 and knew before many, many people that millions would die. Nor at any time subsequently did I have one. Even as someone who has spent an unusual amount of time thinking about the Treasury’s internal payments system for a person who has never been in government, I find grasping the full implications of Elon Musk and his apparatchiks reaching into and trying to exert full control over the Treasury’s payment system mind-boggling.&nbsp;</p><p>There is <strong>nothing more important on the entire planet than getting Elon Musk and DOGE out of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service</strong> and allowing career civil service employees to run the Treasury’s internal payments system without capricious and self-serving interference from billionaires and their allies. This effort must fail if we are to safeguard any semblance of due process and lawfulness in the executive branch. A vague anonymous promise that DOGE only has “read only” access is not enough.

However, events have overtaken me: the Trump administration’s sudden and rapid rollout of spending freezes across the entire federal government requires extensive commentary. It is no exaggeration to say that this is the most dramatic event in the constitutional law of fiscal policy in the United States ever. That may not sound like a five alarm fire to you, but to me that is enormously alarming to type out. Yet, I would be surprised if any constitutional expert would seriously dispute it (outside perhaps the motivated reasoning of law professors who support what the Trump administration is doing) .\n\nSo what is so dramatic about this moment? Let’s start with the basics. President Trump entered office at the beginning of last week. He launched a raft of executive orders attempting to reshape the federal government according to his priorities root and branch. The Office of Management and Budget memo implementing these executive orders usefully cites the most relevant ones (I’ve uploaded a copy of the memo to my website for posterity): \n\nProtecting the American People Against Invasion (Jan. 20, 2025), Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid (Jan. 20, 2025), Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements (Jan. 20, 2025), Unleashing American Energy (Jan. 20, 2025), Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing (Jan. 20, 2025), Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government (Jan. 20, 2025), and Enforcing the Hyde Amendment (Jan. 24, 2025).\n\nThese titles provide a good idea of what Trump’s first two weeks less than two weeks back in office have been like in the administrative state.\n\nHowever, the ideological flavor is in some ways a distraction from the deeper significance. The rhetorical framing of these executive orders obscure their most urgent goal. That is: taking far greater control over congress’s authority to spend. Which brings us back to that OMB order:  \n\nTo implement these orders, each agency must complete a comprehensive analysis of all of their Federal financial assistance programs to identify programs, projects, and activities that may be implicated by any of the President’s executive orders. In the interim, to the extent permissible under applicable law, Federal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal. \n\nThis temporary pause will provide the Administration time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the President’s priorities. The temporary pause will become effective on January 28, 2025, at 5:00 PM. [emphasis in the original]\n\nA “temporary pause” on all disbursement of “federal financial assistance” is an absolutely astounding step. Let’s not forget the scale of US federal funding. As the memo says, this affects appropriations which amounted to nearly three trillion dollars in the 2024 fiscal year. This is an enormous act to take with an executive order. In fact, for reasons I’ll outline in this post, that is an understatement in crucial ways.\n\nTaking this kind of action with an agency guidance memo implementing executive orders is already extraordinary. But now note when the order was supposed to become effective: “January 28, 2025, at 5:00 PM”. But when was this memo issued? It is dated January 27th, with the reporting indicating it reached email inboxes at 5 PM that day. So not only did they attempt to freeze an enormous part of the federal government’s budget, they tried to do so with exactly 24 hours notice. The memo is also only two pages long, and its language is broad, vague and sweeping. \n\nIn particular, the memo didn’t list any programs it applied to (only a couple it didn’t apply to, like social security and Medicare). It says it doesn’t apply to benefits provided “directly to individuals”, for starters, but does that include or exclude state administered Medicaid or SNAP? How about student loans through student loan servicers? The result was wholly predictable. Payment portals across the Federal government went down: from housing assistance through HUD, to nonprofits that provide essential services like the Head Start program, to Medicaid portals which went down for all 50 states on Tuesday and into Wednesday. \n\nSubscribe- 50% off!\n\nReporters are still sorting out all that was affected and what might still be affected. In those circumstances, it was not surprising that about 44 hours after the memo reached administrative agencies throughout the Federal Government, it was rescinded in another terse two sentence memo. Besides the chaos, another reason the OMB guidance was rescinded was that a DC court was in the process of issuing an injunction against the freeze. Why? Because the OMB guidance was wildly unconstitutional. The president does not have the authority to pick and choose which laws to implement. As the constitution puts it, the President has the responsibility to \"faithfully execute the laws\". Congress has the “power of the purse”, and this was the president trying to take control of the purse strings. What the OMB guidance did is known in constitutional terms as “impoundment”. Impoundment is only constitutional if the legislation “appropriating” funds to be disbursed authorizes the president to spend less than what was appropriated.\n\nWhich brings me to a new angle to a well worn topic in this newsletter: the debt ceiling. The topic of impoundment might seem far afield from the debt ceiling, but it is not. Impoundment in fact plays a key analytical part of the debt ceiling conversation. In Neil Buchanan and Michael Dorf’s 2012 Columbia law review article “How to Choose the Least Unconstitutional Option: Lessons for the President (and Others) from the Debt Ceiling Standoff”, they proposed that the debt ceiling brought forward a constitutional “trilemma”. As the 2011 Federal Reserve memo I obtained through FOIA concisely states: \n\n“With the federal debt ceiling binding and the Treasury running out of the additional borrowing capacity it can achieve under various accounting procedures, a technical default on Treasury securities cannot be ruled out”.\n\nIn other words, the debt ceiling superficially seems to create a mismatch between spending and the executive’s legal authority to finance said spending. It's crucial to emphasize that this is a fairly unique feature of our constitutional system. In parliamentary systems, legislation which authorizes spending automatically authorizes financing. It is not possible to create a legal mismatch between budgetary authority and financing authority in those constitutional systems.\n\nAccording to Buchanan and Dorf, there are three ways to resolve this alleged “Trilemma”. The first way is to violate the debt ceiling law and simply issue more treasury securities. This is unconstitutional because it's unconstitutional to plainly and intentionally violate a statute passed by congress (we’ll get back to that…) However, Buchanan and Dorf argue that this is the “least unconstitutional option” because plainly violating a statute is a lesser offense than the other two options. The second option is obviously for the treasury to default on its debt. I’ve spent so much time in this newsletter focusing on default’s consequences as well as its unconstitutionality, that I feel no need to belabor the point here.\n\nThis, however, leads to the third point in the Buchanan and Dorf trilemma. This point is increasing taxes or cutting spending without congressional authorization. Putting aside the idea of unconstitutionally raising taxes, this point of the trilemma essentially is impoundment. Thus, truly and fully understanding the debt ceiling and its constitutional implications also involves understanding impoundment. Indeed, we may be in an impoundment trilemma where the debt ceiling is one of the points on the triangle rather than the other way around.\n\nThe possibility of impoundment being a serious solution to the debt ceiling trilemma was so unlikely to Buchanan and Dorf that they quickly disposed of it in their 70 page article. The core of their analysis is laid out in three paragraphs worth quoting in full:\n\nRegarding the spending power, the picture is a bit more nuanced. In the early years of the Republic, Congress passed laws that authorized the president to spend “up to” certain sums of money, and the president was accordingly able to carry out his constitutional duties while spending money in amounts not precisely specified by Congress.\n\nIn most areas of the federal budget, however, that practice has long since ended. Congress now typically specifies precise amounts of money (or, in the case of so-called entitlement programs, precise formulae to determine amounts of money) that the president must spend for each authorized program. When Congress appropriates the money necessary to fund those authorized programs, it effectively orders the president to spend no more and no less than those amounts. It would be odd, indeed, if a president were to assert that he could choose to, say, send Medicare beneficiaries (or their medical care providers) less money than they would be entitled to receive under the relevant statute. \n\nMoreover, we need not speculate about what would happen if a president were to assert such authority. The impoundment controversy during the Nixon Administration involved a direct confrontation between the executive and legislative branches, with Congress objecting to Nixon’s theory of an “imperial presidency,” in which the president would have the power to selectively reduce certain spending programs at his discretion. [emphasis added]\n\nNote the way they ridicule (at least by the subtle standard of legal academia) the idea that a president could simply choose to send medical care providers less money than statutorily required. Spending less than authorized was seen as so obviously and clearly unconstitutional to them (and indeed to a panoply of legal experts) that it felt easy to dispose of. \n\nPredictably, the major episode that presaged the current one was when Nixon tried to claim expansive authority to impound. He claimed this right on the basis of the constitution’s “executive power” clause in the service of preserving “fiscal integrity”. As President Nixon stated at a press conference 52 years ago (to the day!):\n\nThe constitutional right for the President of the United States to impound funds and that is not to spend money, when the spending of money would mean either increasing prices or increasing taxes for all the people, that right is absolutely clear.\n\nClearly, these kinds of sweeping claims did not pass muster. When forced to try to come up with alternative legal authority to impound, a number of statutes were invoked but it is most notable that the Nixon administration itself also invoked the debt ceiling during its impoundment episode. Even at the time, this was seen as the administration's most plausible rationale.\n\nSubscribe- 50% off!\n\nYet, the Nixonian approach to impoundment was widely rejected and resulted in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. That statute established a process to freeze appropriations for certain particular, specified reasons for 45 days while the President notifies congress of his desire for the appropriations to be rescinded. If congress does not pass a law rescinding the spending, the president is obliged to follow through on that congressionally mandated disbursement. Thus the ICA’s “rescission” power is extraordinarily limited. Which is likely why the Trump administration did not try to use it. \n\nIt's important to underscore that impounding unconditionally mandated appropriations was already quite unconstitutional. The statute merely created a process to manage impoundment emanating from narrow, legitimate reasons. There is a reason that scholars like Buchanan and Dorf treat it as otherwise unconstitutional. For them, Congress spoke loudly and clearly in 1974. Case closed, impoundment is more unconstitutional than violating the debt ceiling. \n\nIf only it were that simple.\n\nAs a famous twentieth century statesman might have said in this situation \"...and how many divisions does the Constitution have?” \n\nBuchanan and Dorf’s paper envisioned congress passing legislation clarifying that what the president is doing is unconstitutional, thus retaining tight legislative control over the “power of the purse”. This is, to say the least, unlikely when the president is Donald Trump and the 2025 Republican Party has majorities in both the house and senate. Without congress or the president preventing grossly unconstitutional activities, we are left with the judiciary. While as of this writing, one DC judge issued an injunction against Trump’s executive orders directing sweeping impoundments, it would be foolish to think this is the end of the road. \n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was quick to clarify that the executive orders remain in effect, it's only the OMB guidance that has been rescinded. Meanwhile Trump’s OMB nominee Russell Vought is on record about his belief that the president has sweeping impoundment powers, whereas the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is unconstitutional. The think tank he founded in 2021 and served as president of, the Center for Renewing America, has released multiple white papers and an op ed explicitly making the case that expansive impoundment is constitutional, while the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is the actual unconstitutional part of the impoundment story. Mark Paoletta, first author on those white papers and that Op Ed, is now the Office of Management and Budget’s general counsel. \n\nTrump’s inner circle has been talking about expansively using impoundment for a while. Jeff Stein & Jacob Bogage at the Washington Post covered their desire to pick a fight over impoundment (albeit not necessarily this fight in this fashion) in June of last year. The Trump administration looks  poised to regroup and come up with a number of approaches to getting the impoundment they want. Reporting as of yesterday suggests funds are still being frozen at the National Science Foundation, for example. We are still on track for a speedy constitutional confrontation over these executive orders, OMB guidance or not.\n\nGiven the precedent of the Nixon administration (and admittedly the bias of my research interests), I can’t help but think about the possibility that they may leverage the debt ceiling to pursue impoundment. The debt ceiling is indeed back in the news and as we speak the Treasury is using “extraordinary measures” to avoid the limit. There is also recent legal research that challenges Buchanan and Dorf’s assessment that violating the debt ceiling is the “least unconstitutional option”. Lawrence Rosenthal argues in an article in a specialist NYU Law journal simply titled “The Debt Ceiling is Constitutional” that not following through on congressionally mandated spending is allowed when the debt ceiling is binding (because, he argues, it has created an “operational factor”.)\n\nAs the Government Accountability Office has stated on numerous occasions: “Programmatic delays occur when an agency is taking reasonable and necessary steps to implement a program or activity, but the obligation or expenditure of funds is unavoidably delayed”. The legal significance of this is that it makes these spending “delays” not impoundments, and not subject to the Impoundment Control Act. A significant amount of what the GAO does is make rulings on whether congressional appropriations are experiencing legal “programmatic delays”, or unconstitutional impoundments. Under Rosenthal’s line of thinking, the debt ceiling creates a legal way to “freeze” spending by making potentially trillions of dollars of spending subject to “programmatic delays”.\n\nOf course, Rosenthal did not claim that what the Trump administration is trying to do, pick and choose the spending it likes, is constitutional. He analogizes his “solution” to a government shutdown, that is when congress fails to appropriate the spending needed for normal functioning of government. This would be a “programmatic delay” across the board, with possibly a carveout for non-annual appropriations like social security and medicare, that would likely be treated as “harmlessly unconstitutional” by judges. But just because he is not defending the executive’s authority to “pick and choose” to avoid the debt ceiling, doesn’t mean these arguments can’t be marshalled in that direction. Imagine the havoc that could be reached if congressional Republicans decided to go back to raising the debt ceiling, rather than suspending it, in order to repeatedly stop the types of appropriations out of favor with the new administration. \n\nThe elephant in the room of all this is that the judiciary currently appears to be the most significant constraint on the Trump administration’s impoundment maneuvers. If you do not support President Trump’s agenda, this is not a comforting thought for a number of reasons. Not least of which is that three of the nine justices were appointed by Trump in his last term. Nevertheless, there are reasons to think this is a particular issue where the Republican appointee dominated court might part ways with Trump. For one thing, their decisions in recent years have targeted the discretion of the administrative state, particularly over budgetary issues as an improper delegation of Congress’s “power of the purse”. Their zealous targeting of a lack of sufficiently tight congressional control over administrative agencies' conduct, even over the intentions of congress itself, cuts into the opposite direction of granting the executive branch increasing discretion over spending. That could stand even if they like it better when it’s in the president’s direct purview. \n\nFurthermore, chief justice John Roberts is on record on this issue in a number of places. One of the most interesting sources is one recently unearthed by Lever News. In a cover letter to a White House memo in 1985, then associate White House counsel wrote: \n\nThe attached memorandum simply outlines the requirements of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, 2 u.s.c. §§ 681-688, touches upon the unresolved Chadha issue presented by that Act, and attempts to dampen any hopes that inherent constitutional impoundment authority may be invoked to achieve budget goals. As noted in the memorandum, the question of whether the President has such authority is not free from doubt, but I think it clear that he has none in normal situations, and we should discourage Chew and others from considering impoundment as a viable budget planning option. Our institutional vigilance with respect to the constitutional prerogatives of the presidency requires appropriate deference to the constitutional prerogatives of the other branches, and no area seems more clearly the province of Congress than the power of the purse. [emphasis added]\n\nOf course, a lot has changed in forty years. Yet Roberts’ 1985 statement still reflects the overwhelmingly dominant legal opinion today, including from the Supreme Court itself. But those are the famous last words of a graveyard of commentators seeking to predict the outer limits of the recent Supreme Court’s willingness to invent doctrine to reach a predetermined conclusion, facilitating a recently formulated agenda.\n\nSubscribe- 50% off!\n\nIn my view, the only way to truly close the door on the impoundment question in these circumstances is a Supreme Court decision which explicitly and clearly affirms that the president has an affirmative obligation to pursue any mechanism which narrows the mismatch between budgetary and financing authority. This includes accounting gimmicks they have used in the past like “warehousing” foreign currency reserves at the Federal Reserve and, yes, the trillion dollar platinum coin. Without having an explicit, absolute and affirmative obligation to seek out any possible financing authority necessary to faithfully execute the laws, including wonkier options like “low face value, high coupon bonds” and bonds that pay interest but have no principal (“consols”), the possibility arises that the President could do the legal equivalent of “taking a dive”. That is, knowingly behave unconstitutionally, when the debt ceiling is close to binding and a number of the “conventional” extraordinary measures have been “exhausted”. It would still be unconstitutional, but plenty of unconstitutional things pass by without censure when objectors lack standing to sue, or the courts decline to provide relief. “Taking a dive” at least has enough sheen of constitutionality that it could plausibly pass muster in this era of the Supreme Court’s history. \n\nThis is the real legal import of my colleague Rohan Grey’s argument in his fantastic paper “Administering Money: Coinage, Debt Crises, and the Future of Fiscal Policy”. It is not simply that the monetary power is missing from the Buchanan and Dorf trilemma. Nor even that Rohan’s arguments, in combination with the dramatic and flashy trillion dollar platinum coin transforms the trilemma into a demi-quadrilecta (okay, I might go back to the portmanteau drawing board on that one….) It’s that an affirmative obligation of the executive to squeeze out every last financing authority is the only satisfactory, and not wildly disruptive, way out of what Buchanan and Dorf frame as an unavoidable trilemma. Hence Rohan’s provocative but quite strong argument that not only is minting a trillion dollar platinum coin legal, the president has an outright legal obligation to “mint the coin” if that is truly the last financing authority left at their disposal.\n\nIn the meantime, we are going to be hearing a lot more about impoundment. If things keep going at this pace, it will be a long four years. And of course, there are many ways to peel an onion. The debt ceiling is not the only way to try to pursue a strategy of indefinite “programmatic delays”. Last week, before this week’s chaos emerged, I spent a significant amount of time contemplating the climate executive order targeting the “Green New Deal” Inflation Reduction Act. If Trump freezes those tax credits, do those who qualify for them have standing to sue? If they do gain standing, will the Trump administration fall back on arguments about whether the plaintiffs truly qualify for the tax credits? Or even that it is legitimate for them to freeze the tax credits indefinitely, while they look over the criteria and potential beneficiaries have no recourse? \n\nThere’s a lot of levers to pull, but the Trump administration does not seem to have the patience for aiming to win lesser victories. Over the coming weeks, ordinary Americans are in danger of learning a lot more about the “legal plumbing” of fiscal policy—far more than they could ever have the perverse desire to know. That’s not a circumstance that you want to be in, just like you may remember: many of you who started reading me five years ago, just to keep up with the monetary plumbing of our economy. Ordinary Americans are now in danger of learning a lot more about the “legal plumbing” of fiscal policy; far more than they could ever imagine wanting to know. Things aren’t going well.\n\nSubscribe- 50% off!Printer Friendly VersionInstitutional subscription details","html":"<p><em>This is a free piece of Notes on the Crises.</em> <em>Reader support which makes my Freedom of Information Act project, archival research and general writing possible (including my </em><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/what-exactly-is-an-open-market-operation-monetarypolicy201/\"><em><u>#MonetaryPolicy201</u></em></a><em> </em><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/does-restricting-treasury-purchases-to-the-open-market-matter-long-forgotten-secret-federal-reserve-memo-says-no-monetarypolicy201/\"><em><u>series</u></em></a><em>).

In the interim, to the extent permissible under applicable law, Federal agencies <strong>must temporarily pause</strong> all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>This temporary pause will provide the Administration time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the President’s priorities. The temporary pause will become effective on January 28, 2025, at 5:00 PM. [emphasis in the original]</blockquote><p>A “temporary pause” on all disbursement of “federal financial assistance” is an absolutely astounding step. Let’s not forget the scale of US federal funding. As the memo says, this affects appropriations which amounted to <strong>nearly three trillion dollars </strong>in the 2024 fiscal year. This is an enormous act to take with an executive order. In fact, for reasons I’ll outline in this post, that is an understatement in crucial ways.</p><p>Taking this kind of action with an agency guidance memo implementing executive orders is already extraordinary. But now note when the order was supposed to become effective: “January 28, 2025, at 5:00 PM”. But when was this memo issued? It is dated January 27th, with the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/inside-brief-life-trump-federal-spending-freeze/index.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>reporting indicating</u></a> it reached email inboxes at <strong>5 PM that day</strong>. So not only did they attempt to freeze an enormous part of the federal government’s budget, they tried to do so with <strong>exactly 24 hours notice</strong>. The memo is also only two pages long, and its language is broad, vague and sweeping.&nbsp;</p><p>In particular, the memo didn’t list any programs it applied to (only a couple it didn’t apply to, like social security and Medicare). It says it doesn’t apply to benefits provided “directly to individuals”, for starters, but does that include or exclude <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/finance/trumps-spending-freeze-circus-wont-232112836.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>state administered Medicaid or SNAP</u></a>? How about student loans through student loan servicers? The result was wholly predictable. Payment portals across the Federal government <strong>went down:</strong> from housing assistance through HUD, to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/trump-funding-freeze-state-reaction.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>nonprofits that provide essential services</u></a> like the <a href=\"https://x.com/SenatorDurbin/status/1884355524793151842?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Head Start program</u></a>, to Medicaid portals which went down for all 50 states <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/politics/medicaid-freeze.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>on Tuesday and into Wednesday</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe- 50% off!</a></div><p>Reporters are still sorting out all that was affected and what might still be affected. In those circumstances, it was not surprising that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/inside-brief-life-trump-federal-spending-freeze/index.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>about 44 hours</u></a> after the memo reached administrative agencies throughout the Federal Government, it was rescinded in another terse two sentence memo. Besides the chaos, another reason the OMB guidance was rescinded was that a DC court was in the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/politics/inside-brief-life-trump-federal-spending-freeze/index.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>process of issuing an injunction against the freeze</u></a>. Why? Because the OMB guidance <strong>was wildly unconstitutional.</strong> The president does not have the authority to pick and choose which laws to implement. As the constitution puts it, the President has the responsibility to \"faithfully execute the laws\". Congress has the “power of the purse”, and this was the president trying to take control of the purse strings. What the OMB guidance did is known in constitutional terms as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impoundment_of_appropriated_funds?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“impoundment”</u></a>. Impoundment is only constitutional if the legislation “appropriating” funds to be disbursed <strong>authorizes the president to spend less</strong> than what was appropriated.</p><p>Which brings me to a new angle to a well worn topic in this newsletter: the debt ceiling. The topic of impoundment might seem far afield from the debt ceiling, but it is not. Impoundment in fact plays a key analytical part of the debt ceiling conversation. In Neil Buchanan and Michael Dorf’s 2012 <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2016&context=facpub&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Columbia law review article</u></a> “How to Choose the Least Unconstitutional Option: Lessons for the President (and Others) from the Debt Ceiling Standoff”, they proposed that the debt ceiling brought forward a constitutional “trilemma”. As the 2011 Federal Reserve memo <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-got-the-fed-to-release-its-2011-treasury-default-playbook-heres-what-it-says-and-why-it-matters/\"><u>I obtained through FOIA concisely states</u></a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“With the federal debt ceiling binding and the Treasury running out of the additional borrowing capacity it can achieve under various accounting procedures, a technical default on Treasury securities cannot be ruled out”.</blockquote><p>In other words, the debt ceiling superficially seems to <strong>create a mismatch between spending and the executive’s legal authority to finance</strong> said spending. It's crucial to emphasize that this is a fairly <strong>unique</strong> feature of our constitutional system. In parliamentary systems, legislation which authorizes spending <strong>automatically</strong> authorizes financing. It is not possible to create a legal mismatch between budgetary authority and financing authority in those constitutional systems. </p><p>According to Buchanan and Dorf, there are three ways to resolve this alleged “Trilemma”. The first way is to violate the debt ceiling law and simply issue more treasury securities. This is unconstitutional because it's unconstitutional to plainly and intentionally violate a statute passed by congress (we’ll get back to that…) However, Buchanan and Dorf argue that this is the “least unconstitutional option” because plainly violating a statute is a <strong>lesser offense</strong> than the other two options. The second option is obviously for the treasury to default on its debt. I’ve spent <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-got-the-fed-to-release-its-2011-treasury-default-playbook-heres-what-it-says-and-why-it-matters/\"><u>so much time in this newsletter</u></a> focusing on default’s consequences as well as its unconstitutionality, that I feel no need to belabor the point here.</p><p>This, however, leads to the third point in the Buchanan and Dorf trilemma. This point is increasing taxes or cutting spending without congressional authorization. Putting aside the idea of unconstitutionally raising taxes, this point of the trilemma essentially <strong>is impoundment</strong>. Thus, truly and fully understanding the debt ceiling and its constitutional implications also involves understanding impoundment. Indeed, we may be in an impoundment trilemma where the debt ceiling is one of the points on the triangle rather than the other way around.</p><p>The possibility of impoundment being a serious solution to the debt ceiling trilemma was so unlikely to Buchanan and Dorf that they quickly disposed of it in their 70 page article. The core of their analysis is laid out in three paragraphs worth quoting in full:</p><blockquote>Regarding the spending power, the picture is a bit more nuanced. In the early years of the Republic, Congress passed laws that authorized the president to spend “up to” certain sums of money, and the president was accordingly able to carry out his constitutional duties while spending money in amounts not precisely specified by Congress.</blockquote><blockquote>In most areas of the federal budget, however, that practice has long since ended. Congress now typically specifies <strong>precise amounts of money</strong> (or, in the case of so-called entitlement programs, precise formulae to determine amounts of money) that the president must spend for each authorized program. When Congress appropriates the money necessary to fund those authorized programs, it effectively orders the president to spend no more and no less than those amounts. <strong>It would be odd, indeed, if a president were to assert that he could choose to, say, send Medicare beneficiaries (or their medical care providers) less money than they would be entitled to receive under the relevant statute.</strong>&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Moreover, we need not speculate about what would happen if a president were to assert such authority. The impoundment controversy during the Nixon Administration involved a direct confrontation between the executive and legislative branches, with Congress objecting to Nixon’s theory of an “imperial presidency,” in which the president would have the power to selectively reduce certain spending programs at his discretion. [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>Note the way they ridicule (at least by the subtle standard of legal academia) the idea that a president could simply <strong>choose </strong>to send medical care providers less money than statutorily required. Spending less than authorized was seen as<strong> so obviously and clearly unconstitutional</strong> to them (and indeed to a panoply of legal experts) that it felt easy to dispose of.&nbsp;</p><p>Predictably, the major episode that presaged the current one was when Nixon tried to claim expansive authority to impound. He claimed this right on the basis of the constitution’s <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“executive power” clause</u></a> in the service of preserving “fiscal integrity”. As President Nixon stated at a press conference 52 years ago <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/01/archives/transcript-of-the-presidents-news-conference-on-foreign-and.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>(to the day!)</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The constitutional right for the President of the United States to impound funds and that is not to spend money, when the spending of money would mean either increasing prices or increasing taxes for all the people, that right is absolutely clear.</blockquote><p>Clearly, these kinds of sweeping claims did not pass muster. When forced to try to come up with alternative legal authority to impound, a <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1340035?seq=1&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>number of statutes were invoked</u></a> but it is most notable that the Nixon administration itself <a href=\"https://rohangrey.net/coinage.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>also invoked the debt ceiling</u></a> during its impoundment episode. Even at the time, this was seen as the administration's most <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1340035?seq=1&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>plausible rationale</u></a>.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe- 50% off!</a></div><p>Yet, the Nixonian approach to impoundment was widely rejected and resulted in the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. That statute established a process to freeze appropriations for certain particular, specified reasons for 45 days while the President notifies congress of his desire for the appropriations to be rescinded. If congress does not pass a law rescinding the spending, the president is obliged to follow through on that congressionally mandated disbursement. Thus the ICA’s “rescission” power is extraordinarily limited. Which is likely why the Trump administration did <strong>not try to use it.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It's important to underscore that impounding unconditionally mandated appropriations was <strong>already quite unconstitutional.</strong> The statute merely created a process to manage impoundment emanating from narrow, legitimate reasons. There is a reason that scholars like Buchanan and Dorf treat it as otherwise unconstitutional. For them, Congress spoke loudly and clearly in 1974. Case closed, impoundment is more unconstitutional than violating the debt ceiling.&nbsp;</p><p>If only it were that simple.</p><p>As a famous twentieth century statesman might have said in this situation <strong>\"...and how many divisions does the Constitution have?”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Buchanan and Dorf’s paper envisioned congress passing legislation clarifying that what the president is doing is unconstitutional, thus retaining tight legislative control over the “power of the purse”. This is, to say the least, unlikely when the president is Donald Trump and the 2025 Republican Party has majorities in both the house and senate. Without congress or the president preventing grossly unconstitutional activities, we are left with the judiciary. While as of this writing, one DC judge issued an injunction against Trump’s executive orders directing sweeping impoundments, it would be foolish to think this is the end of the road.&nbsp;</p><p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was <a href=\"https://x.com/PressSec/status/1884672871944901034?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>quick to clarify that</u></a> the executive orders remain in effect, it's only the OMB guidance that has been rescinded. Meanwhile Trump’s OMB nominee Russell Vought is on record about his belief that the president has sweeping impoundment powers, whereas the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is unconstitutional. The think tank he founded in 2021 and served as president of, <a href=\"https://prospect.org/politics/2024-07-19-trump-administrations-plan-control-spending/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the Center for Renewing America</u></a>, has <a href=\"https://americarenewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Presidents-Constitutional-Power-of-Impoundment-1.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>released multiple</u></a> <a href=\"https://americarenewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-History-of-Impoundments-Before-the-ICA.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>white papers</u></a> and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/4736824-trump-is-right-about-the-impoundment-control-act-its-unconstitutional/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>an op ed</u></a> explicitly making the case that expansive impoundment is constitutional, while the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is the <strong>actual</strong> unconstitutional part of the impoundment story. Mark Paoletta, first author on those white papers and that Op Ed, is <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/12/09/trump-mark-paoletta-general-counsel-office-management-budget/76203176007/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>now the Office of Management and Budget’s general counsel</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Trump’s inner circle has been talking about expansively using impoundment for a while. Jeff Stein &amp; Jacob Bogage at the Washington Post covered their desire to pick a fight over impoundment (albeit not necessarily this fight in this fashion) <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/06/07/trump-budget-impoundment-congress/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>in June of last year</u></a>. The Trump administration looks&nbsp; poised to regroup and come up with a number of approaches to getting the impoundment they want. Reporting as of yesterday suggests funds are still being frozen at <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5279552/scientists-scramble-to-understand-trump-administration-actions?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the National Science Foundation</u></a>, for example. We are still on track for a speedy constitutional confrontation over these executive orders, OMB guidance or not.</p><p>Given the precedent of the Nixon administration (and admittedly the bias of my research interests), I can’t help but think about the possibility that they may leverage the debt ceiling to pursue impoundment. The debt ceiling is indeed back in the news and as we speak the Treasury is using <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5112026-speaker-johnson-debt-ceiling-debate/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“extraordinary measures”</u></a> to avoid the limit. There is also recent legal research that challenges Buchanan and Dorf’s assessment that violating the debt ceiling is the “least unconstitutional option”. Lawrence Rosenthal argues <a href=\"https://nyujlpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JLPP-26-3-Rosenthal.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>in an article in a specialist NYU Law journal</u></a> simply titled “The Debt Ceiling is Constitutional” that not following through on congressionally mandated spending is allowed when the debt ceiling is binding (because, he argues, it has created an “operational factor”.)</p><p>As the Government Accountability Office has <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/870/867606.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>stated on numerous occasions</u></a>: “Programmatic delays occur when an agency is taking reasonable and necessary steps to implement a program or activity, but the obligation or expenditure of funds is unavoidably delayed”. The legal significance of this is that it makes these spending “delays” not impoundments, and not subject to the Impoundment Control Act. A significant amount of what the GAO does is <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/legal/appropriations-law/impoundment-control-act-resources?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>make rulings on whether congressional appropriations</u></a> are experiencing legal “programmatic delays”, or unconstitutional impoundments. Under Rosenthal’s line of thinking, the debt ceiling creates a legal way to “freeze” spending by making potentially trillions of dollars of spending subject to “programmatic delays”.</p><p>Of course, Rosenthal did not claim that what the Trump administration is trying to do, pick and choose the spending it likes, is constitutional. He analogizes his “solution” to a government shutdown, that is when congress fails to appropriate the spending needed for normal functioning of government. This would be a “programmatic delay” across the board, with possibly a carveout for non-annual appropriations like social security and medicare, that would likely be treated as “harmlessly unconstitutional” by judges. But just because he is not defending the executive’s authority to “pick and choose” to avoid the debt ceiling, doesn’t mean these arguments can’t be marshalled in that direction. Imagine the havoc that could be reached if congressional Republicans decided to go back to raising the debt ceiling, rather than suspending it, in order to repeatedly stop the types of appropriations out of favor with the new administration.&nbsp;</p><p>The elephant in the room of all this is that the judiciary currently appears to be the most significant constraint on the Trump administration’s impoundment maneuvers. If you do not support President Trump’s agenda, this is not a comforting thought for a number of reasons. Not least of which is that <strong>three </strong>of the nine justices were appointed by Trump in his last term. Nevertheless, there are reasons to think this is a particular issue where the Republican appointee dominated court might part ways with Trump. For one thing, their decisions in recent years have targeted the discretion of the administrative state, particularly over budgetary issues as an improper delegation of Congress’s “power of the purse”. Their zealous targeting of a <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/640d6616cc8bbb354ff6ba65/t/66aaf0944b2bb43cce96fbeb/1722478740474/Levin+Final.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>lack of sufficiently tight congressional control</u></a> over administrative agencies' conduct, even over the intentions of congress itself, cuts into the opposite direction of granting the executive branch increasing discretion over spending. That could stand even if they like it better when it’s in the president’s direct purview.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, chief justice John Roberts is on record on this issue in a number of places. One of the most interesting sources is one recently <a href=\"https://www.levernews.com/roberts-memo-could-complicate-trumps-spending-freeze/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>unearthed by Lever News</u></a>. In a cover letter to a White House memo in 1985, then associate <a href=\"https://www.levernews.com/content/files/2025/01/1985RobertsMemo-Budget.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>White House counsel wrote</u></a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>The attached memorandum simply outlines the requirements of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, 2 u.s.c. §§ 681-688, touches upon the unresolved Chadha issue presented by that Act, and attempts to dampen any hopes that inherent constitutional impoundment authority may be invoked to achieve budget goals. As noted in the memorandum, the question of whether the President has such authority is not free from doubt, but I think it clear that <strong>he has none in normal situations, and we should discourage Chew and others from considering impoundment as a viable budget planning option</strong>. Our institutional vigilance with respect to the constitutional prerogatives of the presidency requires appropriate deference to the constitutional prerogatives of the other branches, and <strong>no area seems more clearly the province of Congress than the power of the purse</strong>. [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>Of course, a lot has changed in forty years. Yet Roberts’ 1985 statement still reflects the overwhelmingly dominant legal opinion today, including from the Supreme Court itself. But those are the famous last words of a graveyard of commentators seeking to predict the outer limits of the recent Supreme Court’s willingness to invent doctrine to reach a predetermined conclusion, facilitating a recently formulated agenda.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe- 50% off!</a></div><p>In my view, the only way to truly close the door on the impoundment question in these circumstances is a Supreme Court decision which explicitly and clearly affirms that the president has an affirmative obligation to pursue any mechanism which narrows the mismatch between budgetary and financing authority. This includes accounting gimmicks they have used in the past like “warehousing” <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/more-foia-findings-the-new-nixon-administrations-debt-ceiling-dilemma-and-the-federal-reserves-solutions/\"><u>foreign currency reserves at the Federal Reserve</u></a> and, yes, the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/more-foia-memos-the-feds-2013-treasury-default-memo-just-in-time-for-another-round-of-debt-ceiling-politics/\"><u>trillion dollar platinum coin</u></a>. Without having an explicit, absolute and affirmative obligation to seek out any possible financing authority necessary to faithfully execute the laws, including wonkier options <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afb6ef8f-be7c-45ac-8a7d-56550b64fd9e?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>like “low face value, high coupon bonds” and bonds that pay interest but have no principal (“consols”)</u></a>, the possibility arises that the President could do the legal equivalent of “taking a dive”. That is, knowingly behave unconstitutionally, when the debt ceiling is close to binding and a number of the “conventional” extraordinary measures have been “exhausted”. It would still be unconstitutional, but plenty of unconstitutional things <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/04/us/politics/guantanamo-appeals-court-due-process.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>pass by without censure</u></a> when objectors lack standing to sue, or the courts decline to provide relief. “Taking a dive” at least has enough sheen of constitutionality that it could plausibly pass muster in this era of the Supreme Court’s history.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the real legal import of my colleague Rohan Grey’s <a href=\"https://rohangrey.net/coinage.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>argument in his fantastic paper</u></a> “Administering Money: Coinage, Debt Crises, and the Future of Fiscal Policy”. It is not simply that the monetary power is missing from the Buchanan and Dorf trilemma. Nor even that Rohan’s arguments, in combination with the dramatic and flashy trillion dollar platinum coin transforms the trilemma into a demi-quadrilecta (okay, I might go back to the portmanteau drawing board on that one….) It’s that an <strong>affirmative obligation</strong> of the executive to squeeze out every last financing authority is the only satisfactory, and not wildly disruptive, way out of what Buchanan and Dorf frame as an unavoidable trilemma. Hence Rohan’s provocative but quite strong argument that not only is minting a trillion dollar platinum coin legal, the president has an outright <strong>legal</strong> <strong>obligation</strong> to “mint the coin” if that is truly the last financing authority left at their disposal.</p><p>In the meantime, we are going to be hearing a lot more about <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/budget-impoundment/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>impoundment</u></a>. If things keep going at this pace, it will be a long four years. And of course, there are many ways to peel an onion. The debt ceiling is not the only way to try to pursue a strategy of indefinite “programmatic delays”. Last week, before this week’s chaos emerged, I spent a significant amount of time contemplating the climate executive order targeting the <s>“Green New Deal”</s> Inflation Reduction Act. If Trump freezes those tax credits, do those who qualify for them have standing to sue? If they do gain standing, will the Trump administration fall back on arguments about whether the plaintiffs<strong> truly qualify</strong> for the tax credits? Or even that it is legitimate for them to freeze the tax credits indefinitely, while they look over the criteria and potential beneficiaries have no recourse?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a lot of levers to pull, but the Trump administration does not seem to have the patience for aiming to win lesser victories. Over the coming weeks, ordinary Americans are in danger of learning a lot more about the “legal plumbing” of fiscal policy—far more than they could ever have the perverse desire to know. That’s not a circumstance that you want to be in, just like you may remember: many of you who started reading me five years ago, just to keep up with the monetary plumbing of our economy. Ordinary Americans are now in danger of learning a lot more about the “legal plumbing” of fiscal policy; far more than they could ever imagine wanting to know.

According to now-former Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, they began using “extraordinary measures” to avoid hitting the debt ceiling as of today. As regular readers know, I’ve long commented on the absurd political economy of the debt ceiling. I’ve lodged successfully FOIAs and released multiple memos related to the topic. In fact, I’ve written so much about the debt ceiling. that I think it's worthwhile to simply provide a chronological list of all the previous pieces I’ve written in recent years. To start with, The Guardian piece is my most basic primer on the Debt Ceiling and the recurrent concerns about debt ceiling driven default. But all the pieces, especially my Politico Op Ed, are worth a look.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian: The case for minting a $1tn coin to deal with America’s debt ceiling\n\nFinancial Times Alphaville: The Fed will have to accept the $1tn platinum coin\n\nFinancial Times Alphaville: Three questions for Fed Chair Jay Powell\n\nPolitico: Biden Can Steamroll Republicans on the Debt Ceiling And Fed Chair Jay Powell won’t interfere.\n\nNotes on the Crises: I Got the Fed to Release its 2011 “Treasury Default” Playbook. Here’s What it Says and Why it Matters.\n\nNotes on the Crises: More FOIA Findings: The New Nixon Administration’s Debt Ceiling Dilemma and the Federal Reserve’s Solutions\n\nNotes on the Crises: Paul Volcker’s Secret December 1973 Phone Call to Fed Chairman Arthur Burns Revealed\n\nOf course, the concerns about the debt ceiling aren’t anywhere near as serious as they were in 2023. That’s because Donald Trump was inaugurated as president yesterday. As my Politico Op-Ed covers, the debt ceiling has become a tool for Republican congresspeople to use the threat of default to push through their preferred fiscal policies. Their need, and their willingness, to do this under a Republican president is obviously radically lower. This is especially true when that president is Donald Trump, who enters his second term as the absolute undisputed leader of the Republican Party. Even if some of the most “hard-line” Republicans hold out, GOP leadership will likely be able to find Democratic votes. After all: Democrats are not comfortable using those same “hardball tactics”. Nor do they show the same partisan unity against Republican presidents that GOP congresspeople have shown against Democratic presidents in recent decades.\n\nNevertheless, the struggle over the debt ceiling may take a significant period of time given the razor-thin Republican congress. The time that “conventional extraordinary measures” buy may not be consistent with that full process playing out. So while the debt ceiling is in the news, it's worth taking another look at the topic.As it happens, I have more successfully FOIAed memos to release. These are follow ups to the “2011” Treasury default memo. In September 2023, I gave the memo a close read, and set them against the 2011 and 2013 FOMC transcripts that seemingly discussed it in the context of the debt ceiling fights going on in those years. What I realized is that despite having the same name and having largely the same content, the 2013 memo under discussion was a different memo, that had subtly different numbering. I thus decided to FOIA for that memo, too. After a year of delays, the FOMC FOIA office gave me access at the end of September. \n\nUnsurprisingly, the 2013 “Potential Policy Responses to the Debt Ceiling” memo by Bill English and Simon Potter is pretty similar to the 2011 “Potential Policy Responses to the Debt Ceiling” by Bill English and Brian Sack. Yet the differences between them are revealing. It is also interesting reading what has evolved from “first draft thinking” to “Federal Reserve consensus” in the intervening two years. In this respect, the memo’s summary of the status of the “first five” options is worth quoting at length:\n\nWe begin by describing how delayed payments could affect five routine policy actions that are permissible under the Federal Reserve Act and fall within the current authorization of the [New York Fed Trading] Desk and the authority of the Reserve Banks. The transcript of the Committee discussion in 2011 suggests that there was broad support for these types of actions, should they prove necessary, without any change to the current procedures. Underlying each of these actions is the premise that the Federal Reserve would continue to accept Treasury securities with delayed payments in these transactions at their (potentially reduced) market values and on the same terms that apply to other Treasury securities. This approach seems appropriate because we continue to anticipate that after a relatively short delay, all Treasury securities will be paid in full, and so the securities remain very low risk. These five actions could help the market cope with the pressures that may emerge in the event of a technical default\n\nIn short, the first five options had by this point become the standard toolkit and they were meant to avoid the fallout from a “technical default” i.e. one that lasted a short period of time. As I pointed out back in 2023, “Option 1” involves continuing to buy defaulted treasuries as if they were not defaulted treasuries. And that means this has remained consistently uncontroversial to Federal Reserve officials.\n\nSubscribe- 50% off!\n\nOptions 6 and 7 in the memo are engaging in repurchase agreements, and reverse repurchase agreements to prevent repo lending rates from going negative (or going too sharply positive). Recall that repo agreements are essentially collateralized lending with “favorable” treatment for creditors in bankruptcy. These options are the same as they were in 2011, though there are more details about how they would work and the tone of the descriptions suggest they were very favored by Fed s. Notably, though the memo ends up merely suggesting that they warrant “serious consideration”... just like last time! \n\nThe most interesting part of the discussion is in fact a brief discussion of legal issues. According to the memo “Such operations could also be authorized by the Chairman to address ‘temporary disruptions of U.S. dollar funding markets’ of a ‘highly unusual nature,’ although the Chairman would consult with the Committee if feasible before taking such a step”. We learn in a footnote that “The Chairman’s authority in such cases was added to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations in January 2013.” meaning the Federal Reserve system had quietly set the stage for engaging in more aggressive support for the treasury market and the wider financial system at a moments notice.\n\n\n\nIt is only with Option 8 that this memo truly diverges from the 2011 one. In 2011, Option 8 was a specific 13(3) lending facility meant to prop up money market mutual funds. The memo explains why: \n\nFinally, the 2011 memo considered the possibility for a new liquidity facility, specifically one targeted to provide support for money market funds (action 8 in the 2011 memo). The transcript from the August 2011 FOMC meeting suggests that such an approach had very little support. Thus, this option is not being considered by the staff at this time. Additionally, staff believes that market operations targeted at purchasing Treasury securities with delayed payments (and perhaps those seen by some market participants as at risk for delayed payments), potentially in combination with RPs, could be a more effective way to provide liquidity to money funds than a lending facility. Such actions, especially if taken before severe market dislocations had pushed prices down substantially, could stem concerns over the viability of money market funds facing large redemptions\n\nIn other words, this option has simply disappeared because the staff gleaned from the 2011 FOMC meeting that discussed the earlier memo that FOMC participants were against it. It’s worth noting that in 2020 the Federal Reserve brought back the Money Market Mutual Fund Lending Facility (MMLF).\n\nWhich brings us to the last two options. Whether numbered Option 9 & 10, as in 2011, or numbered Option 8 & 9 as in 2013, these are the most explosive options. These options essentially involve a commitment to, as much as possible, prevent any wider knock-on effect from a debt ceiling driven treasury default by expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to absorb defaulted treasuries. Just like the FOMC meetings discussing these options, the memo is skittish about their use. However, it makes absolutely clear that these options are “on the table” and given that one option was removed from the memo while these options were not, the Fed clearly remained willing to use this option if it felt it needed to. \n\nThe memo states:\n\nIf these pressures were sufficiently large, the Committee might see such purchases as appropriate to support financial stability and foster its macroeconomic objectives. However, such an approach would insert the Federal Reserve into a volatile political situation and could raise questions about its independence from debt management issues faced by the Treasury. Thus, the staff assumes that the FOMC would not be interested in pursuing these options, but they are presented for completeness. \n\nThe cover letter to these memos, also released to me by the FOMC FOIA office, makes the Fed’s willingness (however reluctant) to use these options even clearer. Entitled “Background Documents and Questions for Discussion of the Debt Ceiling”, the final question states:\n\nIn 2011, the Committee set a high threshold for actions 8 and 9 (purchase operations and outright CUSIP swaps to remove Treasury securities with delayed payments from the market). Such operations could be used to support financial stability and limit the risk of adverse effects on the economy. How would you balance those possible benefits against concerns about the appropriate role of the Federal Reserve in issues related to the fiscal authorities?\n\nThe Federal Reserve wants to avoid being in a situation where it has to overtly diffuse the crisis, but they will take over those duties, if push comes to shove.\n\nSubscribe- 50% off!\n\nAs I discussed in late 2023, the legal memo on accounting gimmicks to avoid the debt ceiling which involved the Fed written by Howard Hackley in 1969 provides quite a wide latitude for rationalizing Federal Reserve actions to avoid default. Even actions that “would constitute a direct extension of credit to the Treasury by the Federal Reserve” can be “legally defensible as not being designed primarily to aid the Treasury but as intended to avoid developments that would have an adverse impact upon the ‘credit situation of the country.’” This clearly remains as the Fed’s guiding legal thinking, even if they carefully hid it for decades.\n\nThe final memo I got hold of is entitled “Impact of Debt Limit Concerns on Financial Market Conditions” by Fabio Natalucci and Kevin Stiroh. This memo has a lot of real time financial detail which is interesting and worth comparing to public accounts of developing financial market stress. However, for today I will point to the one part of it which I think is of lasting interest. That is the survey the New York Fed’s trading desk apparently started keeping on October 2nd, of the type of questions it was getting from market participants. As the graph shows, the questions were primarily concerning what would be accepted by the Fed as collateral in case a treasury default actually happened.\n\nDespite the 2011 memo being around for some time, it has only unevenly been absorbed by debt ceiling discourse. The recent Congressional Research Service report on the Debt Ceiling is one of the few sources which cite the 2011 memo, although the authors do not fully grasp its import. The recent Government Accountability Office report fails to cite it even though it provides a brief (and misleading) discussion of its contents through the FOMC transcripts. \n\nNow that I’ve publicly released the 2013 memos and it is clearer than ever that the Fed will step into stem financial stability concerns, it's worth having an honest conversation about the debt ceiling while the stakes are lower under a Trump presidency. Between Trump’s meme coin and the proposed “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve”, the Trillion dollar platinum coin has never looked more like the “adult in the room”\n\nSubscribe- 50% off!Printer Friendly Version","html":"<p><em>Please recommend an institutional subscription to your academic library or employer (details </em><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/special-announcement-institutional-subscriptions-are-here-get-your-academic-library-or-business-to-subscribe/\"><em><u>here</u></em></a><em>)</em></p><p>The debt ceiling was unsuspended January 1st of this year which means the debt ceiling is back.

Underlying each of these actions is the premise that the Federal Reserve would continue to accept Treasury securities with delayed payments in these transactions at their (potentially reduced) market values and on the same terms that apply to other Treasury securities. This approach seems appropriate because we continue to anticipate that after a relatively short delay, all Treasury securities will be paid in full, and so the securities remain very low risk. These five actions could help the market cope with the pressures that may emerge in the event of a technical default</blockquote><p>In short, the first five options had by this point become the standard toolkit and they were meant to avoid the fallout from a “technical default” i.e. one that lasted a short period of time. As <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-got-the-fed-to-release-its-2011-treasury-default-playbook-heres-what-it-says-and-why-it-matters/\"><u>I pointed out back in 2023</u></a>, “Option 1” involves continuing to buy defaulted treasuries as if they were <strong>not</strong><em> </em>defaulted treasuries. And that means this has remained consistently uncontroversial to Federal Reserve officials.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe- 50% off!</a></div><p>Options 6 and 7 in the memo are engaging in repurchase agreements, and reverse repurchase agreements to prevent repo lending rates from going negative (or going too sharply positive). Recall that repo agreements are essentially collateralized lending with “favorable” treatment for creditors in bankruptcy. These options are the same as they were in 2011, though there are more details about how they would work and the tone of the descriptions suggest they were very favored by Fed s. Notably, though the memo ends up merely suggesting that they warrant “serious consideration”... just like last time!&nbsp;</p><p>The most interesting part of the discussion is in fact a brief discussion of legal issues. According to the memo “Such operations could also be authorized by the Chairman to address ‘temporary disruptions of U.S. dollar funding markets’ of a ‘highly unusual nature,’ although the Chairman would consult with the Committee if feasible before taking such a step”. We learn in a footnote that “The Chairman’s authority in such cases was added to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations in January 2013.” meaning the Federal Reserve system had quietly set the stage for engaging in more aggressive support for the treasury market and the wider financial system at a moments notice.</p><p></p><p>It is only with Option 8 that this memo truly diverges from the 2011 one. In 2011, Option 8 was a specific 13(3) lending facility meant to prop up money market mutual funds. The memo explains why:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Finally, the 2011 memo considered the possibility for a new liquidity facility, specifically one targeted to provide support for money market funds (action 8 in the 2011 memo). The transcript from the August 2011 FOMC meeting suggests that such an approach had <strong>very little support</strong>. Thus, this option is not being considered by the staff at this time. Additionally, staff believes that market operations targeted at purchasing Treasury securities with delayed payments (and perhaps those seen by some market participants as at risk for delayed payments), potentially in combination with RPs, could be a <strong>more effective way to provide liquidity to money funds than a lending facility</strong>. Such actions, especially if taken before severe market dislocations had pushed prices down substantially, could stem concerns over the viability of money market funds facing large redemptions</blockquote><p>In other words, this option has simply disappeared because the staff gleaned from the 2011 FOMC meeting that discussed the earlier memo that FOMC participants were against it. It’s worth noting that in <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mmlf.htm#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Reserve%20established%20the,credit%20to%20households%20and%20businesses.\"><u>2020 the Federal Reserve brought back the Money Market Mutual Fund Lending Facility (MMLF)</u></a>.</p><p>Which brings us to the last two options. Whether numbered Option 9 &amp; 10, as in 2011, or numbered Option 8 &amp; 9 as in 2013, these are the most explosive options. These options essentially involve a commitment to, as much as possible, prevent any wider knock-on effect from a debt ceiling driven treasury default by expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to absorb defaulted treasuries. Just like the FOMC meetings discussing these options, the memo is skittish about their use. However, it makes absolutely clear that these options are “on the table” and given that one option was removed from the memo while these options were not, the Fed clearly remained willing to use this option if it felt it needed to.&nbsp;</p><p>The memo states:</p><blockquote>If these pressures were sufficiently large, the Committee might see such purchases as appropriate to support financial stability and foster its macroeconomic objectives. However, such an approach would insert the Federal Reserve into a volatile political situation and could raise questions about its independence from debt management issues faced by the Treasury. Thus, the staff assumes that the FOMC would not be interested in pursuing these options, but they are presented for completeness.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>The cover letter to these memos, also released to me by the FOMC FOIA office, makes the Fed’s willingness (however reluctant) to use these options even clearer. Entitled <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20131011memo01.pdf\"><u>“Background Documents and Questions for Discussion of the Debt Ceiling”</u></a>, the final question states:</p><blockquote>In 2011, the Committee set a high threshold for actions 8 and 9 (purchase operations and outright CUSIP swaps to remove Treasury securities with delayed payments from the market). Such operations could be used to support financial stability and limit the risk of adverse effects on the economy. How would you balance those possible benefits against concerns about the appropriate role of the Federal Reserve in issues related to the fiscal authorities?</blockquote><p>The Federal Reserve wants to avoid being in a situation where it has to overtly diffuse the crisis, but they <strong>will </strong>take over those duties, if push comes to shove.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe- 50% off!</a></div><p>As <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/more-foia-findings-the-new-nixon-administrations-debt-ceiling-dilemma-and-the-federal-reserves-solutions/\"><u>I discussed in late 2023</u></a>, the legal memo on accounting gimmicks to avoid the debt ceiling which involved the Fed written by Howard Hackley in 1969 provides quite a wide latitude for rationalizing Federal Reserve actions to avoid default. Even actions that “would constitute a direct extension of credit to the Treasury by the Federal Reserve” can be “legally defensible as not being designed primarily to aid the Treasury but as intended to avoid developments that would have an adverse impact upon the ‘credit situation of the country.’” This clearly remains as the Fed’s guiding legal thinking, <strong>even if they carefully hid it for decades.</strong></p><p>The final memo I got hold of is entitled <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20131011memo03.pdf\"><u>“Impact of Debt Limit Concerns on Financial Market Conditions”</u></a> by Fabio Natalucci and Kevin Stiroh. This memo has a lot of real time financial detail which is interesting and worth comparing to public accounts of developing financial market stress. However, for today I will point to the one part of it which I think is of lasting interest. That is the survey the New York Fed’s trading desk apparently started keeping on October 2nd, of the type of questions it was getting from market participants.

I’m publishing this guest piece as part of a larger interest in the politics of central banking, especially the politics of central banks as fiscal agents. Next week I will be launching a premium “#MonetaryPolicy201” series that will start with a set of legal issues in the 1930s. In 2025 I will be writing more about 1930s and 1940s “fiscal agent” politics at the Federal Reserve. Since my focus is primarily on the United States, it's helpful to get expert perspectives on related histories from other countries. None, of course, are as charged as the history of Nazi Germany. Thank you to Pavlos for writing this fascinating article for Notes on the Crises\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nIn the autumn of 1938, an internal memorandum was circulated among Reichsbank officials about the dire economic situation of Nazi Germany as a result of the frenzied rearmament policy through central bank monetary expansion. Warning against its inflationary effects, the memo suggested a “smooth landing” from a war to a peacetime economy. In the following months, seeing that instead of restraint there was a further acceleration of the armament race, Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht and the banks’ directorate decided to issue an official memorandum, which Schacht delivered directly to Hitler’s hands. Emphasizing that the Fuhrer himself had always “rejected inflation as stupid and senseless”, the letter stressed that “Reichsbank gold and foreign exchange reserves were ‘no longer available’”, that the trade deficit was “rising sharply” and that “price and wage controls were no longer working effectively”. With the volume of notes in circulation accelerating, state finances were bluntly described as “close to collapse”. (Marsh 1992: 119; Mee 2019)[1]. As the memorandum stressed,\n\n\n\n\n\n…the unlimited increase in government expenditure defeats every attempt to balance the budget, brings the national finances to the verge of bankruptcy despite an immense tightening of the taxation screw, and as a result is ruining the central bank and its currency. There exists no recipe, no system of financial or monetary techniques – however ingenious or well thought-out – there is no organisation or measure of control sufficiently powerful to check the devastating effects on the currency of a policy of unrestricted spending. No central bank is capable of maintaining the currency against an inflationary spending policy on the part of the state.\n\n\n\nHitler did not appreciate the objections. After all, Schacht was the wizard central banker who had come up with the Mefo Bills, an ‘ingenious and well thought-out’ plan (Tooze 2006: 54).[2] Hitler was also not particularly concerned about inflation. As he had already explained to Schacht “[...] the first cause of stability of our currency is the concentration camp: the currency stays stable, when anyone who asks higher prices is arrested.”.[3] According to some testimonies, after he read the Reichsbank memorandum, Hitler “fell into rage” demanding that Schacht be relieved of his duties, alongside two more Reichsbank officials.\n\n\nThe 1939 memorandum was not critical of the rearmament process, or the military intentions behind it. Hitler was already committed to expanding Germany’s Lebensraum through military action and all state officials were fully aware of that. What the Reichsbank President and directorate members such as Karl Blessing and Wilhelm Vocke expressed was their opposition to what they saw as bad economics.[4] In their postwar testimonies both Schacht and Vocke would claim that the tone of the letter was chosen deliberately in order to ensure their dismissal from the bank. Given that these testimonies appeared when building anti-Nazi credentials was a question of survival, one can take them with a pinch of salt. In any case, Schacht was dismissed (though he remained a Minister without portfolio - Reichsminister) while Blessing and Vocke, who were not mentioned in Hitler’s dismissal order, resigned one month later.\n\n\nOfficially, Hitler’s actions after the memorandum ended the independence of the Reichsbank and has post facto served as evidence of opposition to the Nazi regime by Reichsbank officials. As Simon Mee has shown, however, the so-called ‘independence’ of the central bank had already been ended by a 1937 law[5] — which was itself a merely legal affirmation of changes that had taken place with Hitler’s 1933 rise to power.[6]\n\n\nDuring that period, and among his achievements as “money wizard”, Schacht had created an elaborate system for hiding gold reserves from the official balance sheets of the Reichsbank by placing them in five special accounts created for the purpose. Postwar testimonies of Reichsbank officials claimed that Schacht’s plan for the hidden account was to save enough gold reserves for supporting a return to a ‘free market’ economy. The same officials also claimed that after Goering was informed about the account in 1938 he started using it as a ‘war reserve’ - contrary to Schacht’s wishes. But a more informed statement by Emil Puhl,[7] vice-president of the Reichsbank between February 1939 and May 1945, admits that the special account was known as the ‘war reserve’ already by 1937, when Schacht was still president.[8] Contrary to his later testimonies, this hidden gold reserve was used for the purposes of re-armament until 1939. Finally, balance sheet statements recovered by American officials show that this ‘hidden reserve’ continued to be utilised at least until 1942.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage from the recovered balance sheet statements of the Reichsbank highlighting the hidden gold reserves.\n\nDeclassified E.O. 12065 Section 3-402/NNDG, No. 775059\n\n\n\n\nThe 1939 dismissal of Schacht from the Reichsbank had not, despite his various excuses to his interrogators in the postwar period, ended his collaboration with the Nazis. Appointed “Reichminister without portfolio” in Hitler’s cabinet straight after his dismissal, he continued receiving wages from the Reichsbank until 1942.[9] Moreover, both Schacht and Vocke, their commendable dismissal/resignation notwithstanding, had routinely signed orders to financially persecute Jews directly contributing to all financial measures that were part of the process of “Aryanization” of the economic sphere. If there is a difference between them, it concerns Schacht’s continued engagement with the Nazi regime as opposed to Vocke’s complete withdrawal from public life.\n\n\nBlessing purported opposition to Nazism carries even less evidence. While some accounts claim that he had little time for the Nazis, Blessing had already joined the NSDAP in 1937 (around the same time he had joined the Reichsbank) and had participated in conferences organized by the central bank as a party member. He was, for example, present in the “Conference on the Jewish Question” that took place two days after the Kristallnacht in 1938 at Goering’s Ministry, a meeting tasked with “...formulating specific steps to be taken to insure [sic] the complete elimination of Jewish participation in the economic and social life of Germany”[10]. Even more damning was the fact that after leaving the Reichsbank, Blessing hung out with Himmler and his Freundekreis (Circle of Friends), a group of elite industrialists and SS members.[11] In the company of this select group of pleasant people, Blessing took part in Himmler’s guided tours to Dachau (1937) and Oranienburg (1939). Like many other initial National Socialist sympathizers, Blessing would eventually find himself in the ranks of the conservative opposition to Hitler which conspired for the assassination attempt of July 1944. While this act has received memorable reports and glorification, it is often forgotten that many of the conspirators were conservative reactionaries with deep anti-Semitic beliefs who were essentially horrified by the prospect of military defeat, and further humiliation (second within three decades) of the Germany army. As reports by US Military Authorities on the composition and intentions of this group show, another strong motivation was to reach an agreement with the Western Allies, in order to collaborate against the Soviet Union. According to his own testimony, Blessing escaped his execution after the July 1944 assassination attempt due to the direct intervention of then Reichsbank President, Walther Funk.\n\n\nDuring the postwar Nuremberg trial, Schacht was charged with funding the re-armament process and ‘preparing the war’ for Hitler. As the documents of his interrogation by Allied forces in July 1945 show, he defended himself by claiming that after 1938 he refused any discounting requests addressed to the Reichsbank (because he was “opposed to the war”), while also repeating the claim that the 1939 memorandum was an excuse to leave the central bank. Pushed by his interrogator, however, he admitted that the Nazi state continued to function, in part, through issuing government securities which crucially relied on the Reichsbank as a “fiscal agent”.[12] At the time, none of that convinced his interrogators, so he was shown the way to Nuremberg.\n\n\nAlready serving as president of the directorate of the Bank deutsche Länder — the postwar precursor of the Bundesbank created to oversee the currency reform of 1948 —, Wilhelm Vocke served as a Schacht’s witness at Nuremberg. His main line of defence was to repeat the claim that the 1939 memorandum was an act of anti-Nazi resistance and a “mutiny” against Hitler. According to his lawyer, Schacht was a “martyr to the ideals of a sound currency”. As Mee notes, it was this portrayal of the memorandum by both Schacht and Vocke that convinced the Nuremberg judges to acquit Schacht of all charges. But its uses went beyond ensuring Schacht’s acquittal in Nuremberg. For it was at that precise moment that one of the most persistent mythologies of postwar Germany was born, that of associating the pursuit of “sound finance” by independent central bankers with resistance to Nazism.\n\n\nRather than a counterforce against authoritarianism, the doctrine of central bank independence (CBI) promotes the conceptualisation of inflation and political interference as cardinal sins, against which authoritarian (or even military, as we shall see) actions are seen as acceptable. This fact becomes visible in another, largely forgotten, episode of that period which links the Reichsbank, the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia and confiscation of its gold reserves, BoE’s Governor Norman and the Bank of International Settlements (BiS). And it brings us back to 1939, around the time of Schacht’s dismissal from the Reichsbank.\n\n\n\n“Aryanizing” Central Bank Independence\n\n\nMontagu Norman, Deputy Governor of the BoE from 1918 to 1920 and Governor until 1944, is correctly credited as one of the first central bankers to promote the concept of central bank independence already from the early 1920s. Initially motivated by personal considerations in relation to the BoE and the various national banks of the British Empire and the Dominions, Norman quickly became an advocate of CBI per se and a tireless proponent of the creation of an epistemic community of central bankers structured around their independence from political/democratic interference.[13]\n\n\nAware that beyond central banking practitioners CBI remained an institutional form for which, according to Norman, “there is no text book”,[14] he had put his full weight behind Kisch & Elkin’s 1928 Central Banks: A Study of the Constitution of Banks of Issue, the first ever attempt to spell out a theoretical doctrine of CBI. Regarded as “a book on a new subject” (Hawtrey 1928)[15], Norman considered the issue so important that he overcame his reluctance to make public interventions and took it upon himself to write the book’s foreword. There, he remarked that\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the outbreak of war in 1914 the traditional practices of Central Banks were gradually abandoned under the pressure of political expediency. The following years of peace saw the scope of some existing Central Banks altered and new institutions established, and with the return of more normal conditions questions arose regarding the rightful functions and powers of Central Banks in general. Thus it became necessary to consider precisely what rules and statutes should be adopted for the purpose either of limiting or of increasing the respective powers of such Banks.\n\n\n\n\n\nForeword to Kitsch & Elkin (1928), p.V (my emphasis)\n\n\n\n\nAlready from 1921, in a manifesto circulated (and received with great approval) by central banking peers such as Benjamin Strong of the Federal Reserve, Norman noted with doctrinal persistence that “a Central Bank should be independent”.[16] Such an unequivocal belief in CBI was directly connected to a strong distrust of ‘politics’ and a self-understanding of central bankers as a separate ‘caste’ of technocrats who “had more chance than any politicians of guiding the peoples of the world, both nationally and internationally, in the adoption and maintenance of policies needing time and patience”.[17]\n\n\nNorman and Schacht shared this aversion towards central banks being “constantly hampered by the political authorities” (as the latter would put it),[18] developing a very close personal friendship as early as 1926. We thus learn from Morgenthau’s diaries, for example, that when Schacht was sent to London in December 1938, officially tasked by Hitler to reach an agreement about plans to fund the forced expulsion of Jews through ‘German’ funds (expropriated property of Jews) and international funds (through the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees set up by the US), Schacht used the trip “to capitalize one of his remaining assets, namely, his connections with and acceptability to the Bank of England and the British financial community” in order to strengthen his increasingly weak position inside Germany. More than happy “to make a show of the community of central bankers” (Morgenthau Diaries, Book. 159, p. 69), Norman would reciprocate with a visit to Berlin in January 1939, taking the opportunity to fulfill his “long standing promise [to] become godfather to Schacht’s grandchild” (Ibid).\n\n\nAs noted, Norman’s full-fledged solidarity with Schacht went beyond their personal friendship. It was primarily reflective of his anti-inflationary priorities and the strong conviction that only independent central bankers could be effective against political interference brought about by “the gradual extension of the franchise and the reform of electoral systems [...] growing unionisation, the rise of political parties dominated by the working classes and the growing attention paid to the problem of unemployment”[19].\n\n\nIn the case of Nazi Germany, it was seen as a means of minimising inflationary pressures in the German economy and Hitler’s protectionist and state-planning tendencies. As such, it was also fully consistent with Norman’s conviction about the need for a policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany (Morgenthau Diaries, Book 159, p. 275) and his awareness of Schacht’s active role in the process of ‘Aryanization’ of the Reichsbank,[20] the expropriation of Jewish property and the forced expulsion of Jews. Lastly, it was also in full knowledge of Nazi expansion plans in Central Europe, which Norman saw as “inevitable”.[21]\n\n\nSuch gestures of central bankers’ solidarity would not, in the end, help Schacht retain his position in the Reichsbank - although, as mentioned, he remained a member of Hitler’s cabinet. Norman would be disappointed, relaying one month after Schacht’s dismissal that he considered him his most important source of knowledge about Germany “for the last sixteen years” (Morgenthau Diaries, Book 166, p. 104), further noting that Schacht’s firing raised concerns “over the question of business morality”. “If the capitalist system is to survive”, he added, “that must be improved” (Morgenthau Diaries, Book 164, p. 324).\n\n\n\nReplacing “The Old Wizard” With New Gold\n\n\nSchacht’s replacement – Walther Funk – might have been a loyal Nazi, but he was hardly equipped to deal with the mounting economic problems.[22] In his meetings with other central bankers at the BiS, insisting that he intended relations between the Reichsbank and the BiS to remain unchanged despite the initial shock after Schacht’s dismissal,[23] he also showed that his approach to economic and monetary issues relied on Hitler’s dictums. In a telegram sent to U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau on March 14th 1939, for example, we learn that Funk declared that although\n\n\n\n\n\nhe intended to follow Schacht’s policies [...] it might be found desirable to change the Reichbank’s legal form to make it more definitely a constituent part of the totalitarian state. Inflation he said was inconsistent with the idea of an authoritative [sic] government, and there would be no inflation in Germany.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorgenthau Diaries, Book 169, pp. 152-3\n\n\n\n\nSince, therefore, changing economic and monetary policy within Nazi Germany was out of the question, other options dominated the attempts to secure Nazi finances. One of them: the confiscation of the gold of invaded countries. There is little doubt that the Reichsbank’s hidden accounts were used to store the expropriated gold from invaded countries like Czechoslovakia or Poland. Yet, before the gold could reach the Reichsbank and be directed towards ‘special’ accounts or sold to acquire foreign exchange, another mediation was necessary. For this to take place, however, no Nazis were needed. Just central bankers.\n\n\nA few days after the invasion of Czechoslovakia of March 15th of 1939, the chief cashier of the Bank of England (BoE) received an unusual request from the Bank of International Settlements (BiS)[24]: he was asked to transfer £5.6 million in gold from the No. 2 account to the No. 17 account. It so happened that the BoE did not only already have a banker-customer relationship to the BiS but the nominated Director and Chairman of the Board of the BiS at the time was Otto Niemeyer, who was also the executive director of the BoE.\n\n\nWhen the request to transfer the gold from Account No. 2 to Account No. 17 was made, the BiS knew well that it was essentially asked to transfer gold from the Czech National Bank Account (No. 2) to the Reichsbank’s account (No. 17). While in full knowledge that this was gold seized by the Nazis after their invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia, there was zero hesitation. The gold was transferred on the same day.\n\n\nThe news of the transaction, as well as the ones that followed it, caused a stir around Europe. But when the Governor of the Bank of France called the BoE’s Governor, Montagu Norman, complaining and urging him to organise a joint protest against BiS president Johan Beyen,[25] Norman dismissed his outrage. Speaking as a central banker, he responded by evoking the need to retain the independence of the BiS from ‘political influence’. As he was reported remarking: “it would be wrong and dangerous for the future of the BiS … to attempt for political reasons to influence the decisions of the president.” (BoE, p. 1294).[26]\n\n\nFrom a telegram sent to Morgenthau in early June 1939, however, we learn that a German delegation had gone to London in order to negotiate issues such as Czechoslovakia’s gold held at a BiS account in London and the blocking of other Czechoslovak deposits by Britain (out of fear that Czechoslovak debt to Britain would not be repaid, as had happened with Austria). While British officials made it clear that their debt claims would be repaid, if need be by seized Czech assets, the same report to Morgenthau says that the German delegation had received assurances “from the British Government” (and not just the BoE) that “that no objection would be raised to withdrawal by the Bank for International Settlements of six million pounds which it had on deposit in London for the account of the Czech National Bank and turning it over to the control of the Reichsbank.” (Morgenthau Diaries, Book 193, June 1-3 1939, p. 1/136).\n\n\nAdvised by Norman, Chancellor Chamberlain responded to questions about the Czech gold in the House of Commons by referring to the terms of the Brussels protocol of 1936 and its ratification in 1937, signed by the BoE. That provision, he noted, forbade “taking any steps by way of legislation or otherwise, to prevent the Bank of England from obeying the instruction given to it by its customer the Bank of International Settlements to transfer gold as it may be instructed”. (Ibid, p. 1293)\n\n\nAny further attempts to obstruct the transfer of gold from occupied Czech territories to Nazi hands, and thereby legitimise its expropriation, were met with the same response. After Chamberlain insisted to Norman that the pressure he received was becoming too hard to handle, Norman insisted on the importance of not changing course. “The questions”, he wrote to Chamberlain, “by certain members of the House of Commons do not change my views on, nor my attitude towards, the Bank of International Settlements. I do not, therefore, propose in any way to modify the line of conduct [...]” (Ibid, p. 1295)\n\n\nPost facto excuses for Norman’s attitude by the BoE would claim that his main aim was to “keep the BiS alive to play its part in the solution of post-war problems” (Ibid). But these appear more as postwar excuses rather than facts. We know, for example, that these debates took place in the summer of 1939, before the invasion of Poland. At the same time, as we learn from the Morgenthau diaries, hardly anyone believed that total war was approaching. Instead, as a report from discussions at Basel, headquarters of BiS, indicates most were convinced that no European war would take place.[27]\n\n\nBut we also know that, on the 4th of September 1939, one day after Britain declared war on Germany, Sir Richard Hopkins,[28] a seasoned public servant with a sharp mind, contacted Norman to inform him of the fact that Britain was no longer “bound to observe in wartime the full immunities enjoyed by the BiS.” (BoE, p. 1295). While Norman declared that he would follow that, should it become the government’s official position, he also felt the need to point out that “the proposed attitude of the H.M. Government would doubtless be a surprise to neutral States and would offer hostile propaganda an excellent opportunity for the criticism that […] the HM Government did not hesitate to disregard their international arrangements” (Ibid, p. 1295). In other words, even after Britain had declared war on Germany, Norman continued to hold the same line. Along with the letter, he also included a short memorandum with his suggestions on how to deal with the BiS from that moment on – which was essentially another call to stay put. Ignoring these suggestions, Hopkins wrote back to inform Norman that the Chancellor had decided the following:\n\n\n\n\n 1. That the BoE should not act upon an order of the BiS if it seems to the BoE to be likely that the order might benefit the enemy.\n 2. That the BoE should not act upon an order without consulting the Treasury.\n 3. That the Treasury will not authorise compliance with an order unless satisfied that it is not likely to benefit the enemy.\n 4. That the present order is subject to enquiry to see what the BiS are prepared to say as to the ownership.\n 5. That neutrals are to be assured that in any case where the Treasury are satisfied with ownership, order by the BiS shown to be on behalf of neutrals will be authorised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ibid, p. 1296)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorman was unhappy, but forced to comply. When another request for a transfer was made 5 weeks after war had been declared, the Governor of the BoE nonetheless went to receive instructions from Chamberlain. In a meeting attended by Chamberlain, Hopkins and others, the decision was made that “the state of war overrides political considerations” (Ibid, p. 1297). That statement seems to imply that the relaxed attitude so far was in fact the result of political considerations, rather than some depoliticized adherence to rule-abiding. The decision was immediately sent by telegram to the pleased French authorities. Nonetheless, the BiS continued to hold meetings with directors from different countries (including fascist Italy) under the pretence of being “strictly impartial and neutral”, a position upheld by Beyen’s replacement, the American McKittrick.\n\n\nIn the end, it was the US entry into the war in December 1941 which increased the pressure towards the BiS and its officials who continued to operate as if general discussions and meetings with all members (including Italy and Germany) were not only possible, but desirable. Voices within the British Treasury were also increasingly pushing towards an understanding that “the only way of not being outwitted after the war by the defeated Germans is to cut our connection with the BiS now” (Ibid, p. 1299). In the end, however, it was growing US hostility towards the BiS that changed the situation. As a member of the American Treasury Department argued, the BiS was not neutral, as it claimed, but German-controlled, adding that continued relations with the BiS had brought about a situation where “there is an American president doing business with the Germans while our American boys are fighting Germans” (Ibid, p. 1301). The name of this outspoken Treasury member was Harry Dexter White. His hostility towards the BiS would remain unchanged until the end of the war and would resurface during the July 1944 Bretton Woods negotiations: his direct proposal was that the BiS should be liquidated “at the earliest possible moment”. It was not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.

One month after the Reichsbank memorandum, a group of economists working under the auspices of the Akademie für Deutsches Recht (created by Hitler’s lawyer and future ‘chief jurist’ of occupied Poland, Hans Frank) put their names in an official memorandum on Kriegsfinanzierung (financing the war). Published 8 months after the nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia and 3 months after the invasion of Poland, the Kriegsfinanzierung plan followed in the footsteps of the Reichsbank memorandum. Rejecting the prevalent view that the war could be financed through “money creation” at a time of fixed prices (a process that according to them led to a dislocation of economic activity and suppressed inflation), the professors proceeded to suggest a more suitable way for funding the war machine: “War should only be financed by financed through taxes and bonds. The only thing to be decided is the proportion in which these two means of financing can be used [...] We are fully aware that the proposed path requires determination in the implementation of measures that must be perceived as tough. However, it is suitable for averting even greater hardship for the people” (‘Professoren-Kriegzfinanzierunggutacthen’, 9.12.1939, reproduced in Möller (1961) „Zur Vorgeschichte der DM: die Währungsreformpläne 1945-1948”, Kyklos Verlag, Basel, pp. 37, my translation.

As Mee writes, “In January 1933 [...] new legislation was passed revising the Bank Act of 1924. The legislation, coming into effect in October 1933, helped to restore the state’s grip on the central bank’s personnel. The general council was abolished. In its place, the country’s president could now appoint the Reichsbank’s president, after hearing the expert opinion of the directorate. The central bank president, for his part, could in turn nominate directorate members who were then appointed by the Reich’s president. Legally speaking, however, the Reichsbank was still independent of government instruction – although such legal independence soon meant little in what emerged to be a totalitarian dictatorship.” Mee 2019: 68 ↩︎\n     \n\n 7.

Controller of Finance and Supply Services (1927-1932), head of Treasury (1942-1945), Sir Richard Hopkins was a seasoned public servant with a sharp mind and a taste for practical, new ideas. In 1929, he defended the so-called ‘Treasury view’ in front of the Macmillan Committee. The ‘Treasury view’ was developed in opposition to the views of Lloyd George and JM Keynes who supported that a “loan-financed” public works program was capable of bringing unemployment from 10-11 to 5-6 per cent within a year. Cross examined by Keynes himself during one of the committees’ sessions, Hopkins essentially argued that though there was some evidence that such a scheme would help with unemployment figures, its adoption would set a dangerous precedent of ignoring a balanced budget orientation and the unspoken rule that government expenditure should be sanctioned when it brings a profit. Geared towards increasing competitiveness with an eye on world markets and not on domestic demand, Hopkins would uphold the ‘Treasury view’ despite Keynes’ objections. It was not until 1945 that Hopkins was prepared to accept Keynes’ fundamental inversion of the Treasury View which held that it was saving that determined the level of investment and not vice-versa. But even before that, the achievement of full employment during the war years had convinced both Keynes and Hopkins that there was dire need for a new employment policy to be sketched out. For this reason, Hopkins is credited with intervening for reinstating Keynes as an advisor to the Treasury. By 1944, and after various draft versions of an original paper by James Meade were discussed in a committee chaired by Hopkins, a Keynesian view was adopted and fully backed by Hopkins. Keynes called it a “revolution in official opinion”.

Warning against its inflationary effects, the memo suggested a “smooth landing” from a war to a peacetime economy. In the following months, seeing that instead of restraint there was a further acceleration of the armament race, Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht and the banks’ directorate decided to issue an official memorandum, which Schacht delivered directly to Hitler’s hands. Emphasizing that the Fuhrer himself had always “rejected inflation as stupid and senseless”, the letter stressed that “Reichsbank gold and foreign exchange reserves were ‘no longer available’”, that the trade deficit was “rising sharply” and that “price and wage controls were no longer working effectively”. With the volume of notes in circulation accelerating, state finances were bluntly described as “close to collapse”. (Marsh 1992: 119; Mee 2019)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup>. As the memorandum stressed,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>…the unlimited increase in government expenditure defeats every attempt to balance the budget, brings the national finances to the verge of bankruptcy despite an immense tightening of the taxation screw, and as a result is ruining the central bank and its currency. There exists no recipe, no system of financial or monetary techniques – however ingenious or well thought-out – there is no organisation or measure of control sufficiently powerful to check the devastating effects on the currency of a policy of unrestricted spending. No central bank is capable of maintaining the currency against an inflationary spending policy on the part of the state.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hitler did not appreciate the objections. After all, Schacht was the wizard central banker who had come up with the <em>Mefo Bills</em>, an ‘ingenious and well thought-out’ plan (Tooze 2006: 54).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup> Hitler was also not particularly concerned about inflation. As he had already explained to Schacht “[...] the first cause of stability of our currency is the concentration camp: the currency stays stable, when anyone who asks higher prices is arrested.”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\">[3]</a></sup> According to some testimonies, after he read the Reichsbank memorandum, Hitler “fell into rage” demanding that Schacht be relieved of his duties, alongside two more Reichsbank officials.</p>\n<p>The 1939 memorandum was not critical of the rearmament process, or the military intentions behind it. Hitler was already committed to expanding Germany’s <em>Lebensraum</em> through military action and all state officials were fully aware of that. What the Reichsbank President and directorate members such as Karl Blessing and Wilhelm Vocke expressed was their opposition to what they saw as <em>bad economics</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\">[4]</a></sup> In their postwar testimonies both Schacht and Vocke would claim that the tone of the letter was chosen deliberately in order to ensure their dismissal from the bank. Given that these testimonies appeared when building anti-Nazi credentials was a question of survival, one can take them with a pinch of salt. In any case, Schacht was dismissed (though he remained a Minister without portfolio - <em>Reichsminister</em>) while Blessing and Vocke, who were not mentioned in Hitler’s dismissal order, resigned one month later.</p>\n<p>Officially, Hitler’s actions after the memorandum ended the independence of the Reichsbank and has <em>post facto</em> served as evidence of opposition to the Nazi regime by Reichsbank officials. As Simon Mee has shown, however, the so-called ‘independence’ of the central bank had already been ended by a 1937 law<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\">[5]</a></sup> — which was itself a merely legal affirmation of changes that had taken place with Hitler’s 1933 rise to power.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n<p>During that period, and among his achievements as “money wizard”, Schacht had created an elaborate system for <em>hiding</em> gold reserves from the official balance sheets of the Reichsbank by placing them in five special accounts created for the purpose. Postwar testimonies of Reichsbank officials claimed that Schacht’s plan for the hidden account was to save enough gold reserves for supporting a return to a ‘free market’ economy. The same officials also claimed that after Goering was informed about the account in 1938 he started using it as a ‘war reserve’ - contrary to Schacht’s wishes. But a more informed statement by Emil Puhl,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\">[7]</a></sup> vice-president of the Reichsbank between February 1939 and May 1945, admits that the special account was known as the ‘war reserve’ already by 1937, when Schacht was still president.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\">[8]</a></sup> Contrary to his later testimonies, this hidden gold reserve was used for the purposes of re-armament until 1939. Finally, balance sheet statements recovered by American officials show that this ‘hidden reserve’ continued to be utilised at least until 1942.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2024/12/Schacht-Published-reserves.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"><br>\n<em></em></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Page from the recovered balance sheet statements of the Reichsbank highlighting the hidden gold reserves.<br>\nDeclassified E.O. 12065 Section 3-402/NNDG, No. 775059</em></p><p></p>\n<p>The 1939 dismissal of Schacht from the Reichsbank had not, despite his various excuses to his interrogators in the postwar period, ended his collaboration with the Nazis. Appointed “<em>Reichminister</em> without portfolio” in Hitler’s cabinet straight after his dismissal, he continued receiving wages from the Reichsbank until 1942.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\">[9]</a></sup> Moreover, both Schacht and Vocke, their commendable dismissal/resignation notwithstanding, had routinely signed orders to financially persecute Jews directly contributing to all financial measures that were part of the process of “Aryanization” of the economic sphere. If there is a difference between them, it concerns Schacht’s continued engagement with the Nazi regime as opposed to Vocke’s complete withdrawal from public life.</p>\n<p>Blessing purported opposition to Nazism carries even less evidence. While some accounts claim that he had little time for the Nazis, Blessing had already joined the NSDAP in 1937 (around the same time he had joined the Reichsbank) and had participated in conferences organized by the central bank as a party member. He was, for example, present in the “Conference on the Jewish Question” that took place two days after the <em>Kristallnacht</em> in 1938 at Goering’s Ministry, a meeting tasked with “...formulating specific steps to be taken to insure [<em>sic</em>] the complete elimination of Jewish participation in the economic and social life of Germany”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\">[10]</a></sup>. Even more damning was the fact that after leaving the Reichsbank, Blessing hung out with Himmler and his <em>Freundekreis</em> (Circle of Friends), a group of elite industrialists and SS members.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\">[11]</a></sup> In the company of this select group of pleasant people, Blessing took part in Himmler’s guided tours to Dachau (1937) and Oranienburg (1939). Like many other initial National Socialist sympathizers, Blessing would eventually find himself in the ranks of the conservative opposition to Hitler which conspired for the assassination attempt of July 1944. While this act has received memorable reports and glorification, it is often forgotten that many of the conspirators were conservative reactionaries with deep anti-Semitic beliefs who were essentially horrified by the prospect of military defeat, and further humiliation (second within three decades) of the Germany army. As reports by US Military Authorities on the composition and intentions of this group show, another strong motivation was to reach an agreement with the Western Allies, in order to collaborate against the Soviet Union. According to his own testimony, Blessing escaped his execution after the July 1944 assassination attempt due to the direct intervention of then Reichsbank President, Walther Funk.</p>\n<p>During the postwar Nuremberg trial, Schacht was charged with funding the re-armament process and ‘preparing the war’ for Hitler. As the documents of his interrogation by Allied forces in July 1945 show, he defended himself by claiming that after 1938 he refused any discounting requests addressed to the Reichsbank (because he was “opposed to the war”), while also repeating the claim that the 1939 memorandum was an excuse to leave the central bank. Pushed by his interrogator, however, he admitted that the Nazi state continued to function, in part, through issuing government securities which crucially relied on the Reichsbank as a “fiscal agent”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\">[12]</a></sup> At the time, none of that convinced his interrogators, so he was shown the way to Nuremberg.</p>\n<p>Already serving as president of the directorate of the <em>Bank deutsche Länder</em> — the postwar precursor of the Bundesbank created to oversee the currency reform of 1948 —, Wilhelm Vocke served as a Schacht’s witness at Nuremberg. His main line of defence was to repeat the claim that the 1939 memorandum was an act of anti-Nazi resistance and a “mutiny” against Hitler. According to his lawyer, Schacht was a “martyr to the ideals of a sound currency”. As Mee notes, it was this portrayal of the memorandum by both Schacht and Vocke that convinced the Nuremberg judges to acquit Schacht of all charges. But its uses went beyond ensuring Schacht’s acquittal in Nuremberg. For it was at that precise moment that one of the most persistent mythologies of postwar Germany was born, that of associating the pursuit of “sound finance” by independent central bankers with resistance to Nazism.</p>\n<p>Rather than a counterforce against authoritarianism, the doctrine of central bank independence (CBI) promotes the conceptualisation of inflation and political interference as <em>cardinal sins</em>, against which authoritarian (or even military, as we shall see) actions are seen as acceptable. This fact becomes visible in another, largely forgotten, episode of that period which links the Reichsbank, the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia and confiscation of its gold reserves, <em>BoE’s</em> Governor Norman and the Bank of International Settlements (<em>BiS</em>). And it brings us back to 1939, around the time of Schacht’s dismissal from the Reichsbank.</p>\n<h2 id=\"%E2%80%9Caryanizing%E2%80%9D-central-bank-independence\"><strong>“Aryanizing” Central Bank Independence</strong></h2>\n<p>Montagu Norman, Deputy Governor of the <em>BoE</em> from 1918 to 1920 and Governor until 1944, is correctly credited as one of the first central bankers to promote the concept of central bank independence already from the early 1920s. Initially motivated by personal considerations in relation to the <em>BoE</em> and the various national banks of the British Empire and the Dominions, Norman quickly became an advocate of CBI <em>per se</em> and a tireless proponent of the creation of an epistemic community of central bankers structured around their independence from political/democratic interference.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\">[13]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Aware that beyond central banking practitioners CBI remained an institutional form for which, according to Norman, “there is no text book”,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\">[14]</a></sup> he had put his full weight behind Kisch &amp; Elkin’s 1928 <em>Central Banks: A Study of the Constitution of Banks of Issue</em>, the first ever attempt to spell out a theoretical doctrine of CBI. Regarded as “a book on a new subject” (Hawtrey 1928)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\">[15]</a></sup>, Norman considered the issue so important that he overcame his reluctance to make public interventions and took it upon himself to write the book’s foreword. There, he remarked that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With the outbreak of war in 1914 the traditional practices of Central Banks were gradually abandoned under the pressure of <strong>political expediency</strong>. The following years of peace saw the scope of some existing Central Banks altered and new institutions established, and with the return of more normal conditions questions arose regarding the rightful functions and powers of Central Banks in general. Thus it became necessary to consider precisely <strong>what rules and statutes should be adopted</strong> for the purpose either of limiting or of increasing the respective powers of such Banks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div style=\"text-align: right\"><strong>Foreword to Kitsch &amp; Elkin (1928), p.V (my emphasis) </strong></div><p></p>\n<p>Already from 1921, in a manifesto circulated (and received with great approval) by central banking peers such as Benjamin Strong of the Federal Reserve, Norman noted with doctrinal persistence that “a Central Bank should be independent”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\">[16]</a></sup> Such an unequivocal belief in CBI was directly connected to a strong distrust of ‘politics’ and a self-understanding of central bankers as a separate ‘caste’ of technocrats who “had more chance than any politicians of guiding the peoples of the world, both nationally and internationally, in the adoption and maintenance of policies needing time and patience”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\">[17]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Norman and Schacht shared this aversion towards central banks being “constantly hampered by the political authorities” (as the latter would put it),<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\">[18]</a></sup> developing a very close personal friendship as early as 1926. We thus learn from Morgenthau’s diaries, for example, that when Schacht was sent to London in December 1938, officially tasked by Hitler to reach an agreement about plans to fund the forced expulsion of Jews through ‘German’ funds (expropriated property of Jews) and international funds (through the Intergovernmental Committee for Refugees set up by the US), Schacht used the trip “to capitalize one of his remaining assets, namely, his connections with and acceptability to the Bank of England and the British financial community” in order to strengthen his increasingly weak position inside Germany. More than happy “to make a show of the community of central bankers” (<em>Morgenthau Diaries,</em> Book. 159, p. 69), Norman would reciprocate with a visit to Berlin in January 1939, taking the opportunity to fulfill his “long standing promise [to] become godfather to Schacht’s grandchild” (Ibid).</p>\n<p>As noted, Norman’s full-fledged solidarity with Schacht went beyond their personal friendship. It was primarily reflective of his anti-inflationary priorities and the strong conviction that only independent central bankers could be effective against political interference brought about by “the gradual extension of the franchise and the reform of electoral systems [...] growing unionisation, the rise of political parties dominated by the working classes and the growing attention paid to the problem of unemployment”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\">[19]</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>In the case of Nazi Germany, it was seen as a means of minimising inflationary pressures in the German economy and Hitler’s protectionist and state-planning tendencies. As such, it was also fully consistent with Norman’s conviction about the need for a policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany (<em>Morgenthau Diaries</em>, Book 159, p. 275) and his awareness of Schacht’s active role in the process of ‘Aryanization’ of the Reichsbank,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\">[20]</a></sup> the expropriation of Jewish property and the forced expulsion of Jews. Lastly, it was also in full knowledge of Nazi expansion plans in Central Europe, which Norman saw as “inevitable”.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\">[21]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Such gestures of central bankers’ solidarity would not, in the end, help Schacht retain his position in the Reichsbank - although, as mentioned, he remained a member of Hitler’s cabinet. Norman would be disappointed, relaying one month after Schacht’s dismissal that he considered him his most important source of knowledge about Germany “for the last sixteen years” (<em>Morgenthau Diaries</em>, Book 166, p. 104), further noting that Schacht’s firing raised concerns “over the question of business morality”. “If the capitalist system is to survive”, he added, “that must be improved” (<em>Morgenthau Diaries</em>, Book 164, p. 324).</p>\n<h2 id=\"replacing-%E2%80%9Cthe-old-wizard%E2%80%9D-with-new-gold\"><strong>Replacing “The Old Wizard” With New Gold</strong></h2>\n<p>Schacht’s replacement – Walther Funk – might have been a loyal Nazi, but he was hardly equipped to deal with the mounting economic problems.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\">[22]</a></sup> In his meetings with other central bankers at the <em>BiS</em>, insisting that he intended relations between the Reichsbank and the <em>BiS</em> to remain unchanged despite the initial shock after Schacht’s dismissal,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\">[23]</a></sup> he also showed that his approach to economic and monetary issues relied on Hitler’s <em>dictums</em>. In a telegram sent to U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau on March 14th 1939, for example, we learn that Funk declared that although</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>he intended to follow Schacht’s policies [...] it might be found desirable to change the Reichbank’s legal form to make it more definitely a constituent part of the totalitarian state. Inflation he said was inconsistent with the idea of an authoritative [sic] government, and there would be no inflation in Germany.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong></strong></p><div style=\"text-align: right\"><strong> Morgenthau Diaries, Book 169, pp. 152-3</strong></div><p></p>\n<p>Since, therefore, changing economic and monetary policy within Nazi Germany was out of the question, other options dominated the attempts to secure Nazi finances. One of them: the confiscation of the gold of invaded countries. There is little doubt that the Reichsbank’s hidden accounts were used to store the expropriated gold from invaded countries like Czechoslovakia or Poland. Yet, before the gold could reach the Reichsbank and be directed towards ‘special’ accounts or sold to acquire foreign exchange, another mediation was necessary. For this to take place, however, no Nazis were needed. Just central bankers.</p>\n<p>A few days after the invasion of Czechoslovakia of March 15th of 1939, the chief cashier of the Bank of England (<em>BoE</em>) received an unusual request from the Bank of International Settlements (<em>BiS</em>)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\">[24]</a></sup>: he was asked to transfer £5.6 million in gold from the No. 2 account to the No. 17 account. It so happened that the BoE did not only already have a banker-customer relationship to the <em>BiS</em> but the nominated Director and Chairman of the Board of the <em>BiS</em> at the time was Otto Niemeyer, who was also the executive director of the <em>BoE</em>.</p>\n<p>When the request to transfer the gold from Account No. 2 to Account No. 17 was made, the <em>BiS</em> knew well that it was essentially asked to transfer gold from the Czech National Bank Account (No. 2) to the Reichsbank’s account (No. 17). While in full knowledge that this was gold seized by the Nazis after their invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia, there was zero hesitation. The gold was transferred on the same day.</p>\n<p>The news of the transaction, as well as the ones that followed it, caused a stir around Europe. But when the Governor of the Bank of France called the <em>BoE’s</em> Governor, Montagu Norman, complaining and urging him to organise a joint protest against <em>BiS</em> president Johan Beyen,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\">[25]</a></sup> Norman dismissed his outrage. Speaking as a central banker, he responded by evoking the need to retain the <strong>independence of the <em>BiS</em></strong> from ‘political influence’. As he was reported remarking: “it would be wrong and dangerous for the future of the <em>BiS</em> … to attempt for political reasons to influence the decisions of the president.” (<em>BoE</em>, p. 1294).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\">[26]</a></sup></p>\n<p>From a telegram sent to Morgenthau in early June 1939, however, we learn that a German delegation had gone to London in order to negotiate issues such as Czechoslovakia’s gold held at a <em>BiS</em> account in London and the blocking of other Czechoslovak deposits by Britain (out of fear that Czechoslovak debt to Britain would not be repaid, as had happened with Austria). While British officials made it clear that their debt claims would be repaid, if need be by seized Czech assets, the same report to Morgenthau says that the German delegation had received assurances “from the British Government” (and not just the <em>BoE</em>) that “that no objection would be raised to withdrawal by the Bank for International Settlements of six million pounds which it had on deposit in London for the account of the Czech National Bank and turning it over to the control of the Reichsbank.” (<em>Morgenthau Diaries</em>, Book 193, June 1-3 1939, p. 1/136).</p>\n<p>Advised by Norman, Chancellor Chamberlain responded to questions about the Czech gold in the House of Commons by referring to the terms of the Brussels protocol of 1936 and its ratification in 1937, signed by the <em>BoE.</em> That provision, he noted, forbade “taking any steps by way of legislation or otherwise, to prevent the Bank of England from obeying the instruction given to it by its customer the Bank of International Settlements to transfer gold as it may be instructed”. (Ibid, p. 1293)</p>\n<p>Any further attempts to obstruct the transfer of gold from occupied Czech territories to Nazi hands, and thereby legitimise its expropriation, were met with the same response. After Chamberlain insisted to Norman that the pressure he received was becoming too hard to handle, Norman insisted on the importance of not changing course. “The questions”, he wrote to Chamberlain, “by certain members of the House of Commons do not change my views on, nor my attitude towards, the Bank of International Settlements. I do not, therefore, propose in any way to modify the line of conduct [...]” (Ibid, p. 1295)</p>\n<p><em>Post facto</em> excuses for Norman’s attitude by the <em>BoE</em> would claim that his main aim was to “keep the <em>BiS</em> alive to play its part in the solution of post-war problems” (Ibid). But these appear more as postwar excuses rather than facts. We know, for example, that these debates took place in the summer of 1939, before the invasion of Poland. At the same time, as we learn from the Morgenthau diaries, hardly anyone believed that <em>total war</em> was approaching. Instead, as a report from discussions at Basel, headquarters of <em>BiS</em>, indicates most were convinced that no European war would take place.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\">[27]</a></sup></p>\n<p>But we also know that, on the 4th of September 1939, one day after Britain declared war on Germany, Sir Richard Hopkins,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fnref28\">[28]</a></sup> a seasoned public servant with a sharp mind, contacted Norman to inform him of the fact that Britain was no longer “bound to observe in wartime the full immunities enjoyed by the <em>BiS</em>.” (<em>BoE</em>, p. 1295). While Norman declared that he would follow that, should it become the government’s official position, he also felt the need to point out that “the proposed attitude of the H.M. Government would doubtless be a surprise to neutral States and would offer hostile propaganda an excellent opportunity for the criticism that […] the HM Government did not hesitate to disregard their international arrangements” (Ibid, p. 1295). In other words, even after Britain had declared war on Germany, Norman continued to hold the same line. Along with the letter, he also included a short memorandum with his suggestions on how to deal with the <em>BiS</em> from that moment on – which was essentially another call to stay put. Ignoring these suggestions, Hopkins wrote back to inform Norman that the Chancellor had decided the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>That the BoE should not act upon an order of the BiS if it seems to the BoE to be likely that the order might benefit the enemy.</li>\n<li>That the BoE should not act upon an order without consulting the Treasury.</li>\n<li>That the Treasury will not authorise compliance with an order unless satisfied that it is not likely to benefit the enemy.</li>\n<li>That the present order is subject to enquiry to see what the BiS are prepared to say as to the ownership.</li>\n<li>That neutrals are to be assured that in any case where the Treasury are satisfied with ownership, order by the BiS shown to be on behalf of neutrals will be authorised.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong></strong></p><p></p><div style=\"text-align: right\"><strong>(Ibid, p. 1296)</strong></div><strong> <p></p></strong><p></p>\n<p>Norman was unhappy, but forced to comply. When another request for a transfer was made 5 weeks after war had been declared, the Governor of the <em>BoE</em> nonetheless went to receive instructions from Chamberlain. In a meeting attended by Chamberlain, Hopkins and others, the decision was made that “the state of war overrides political considerations” (Ibid, p. 1297). That statement seems to imply that the relaxed attitude so far was in fact the result of political considerations, rather than some <em>depoliticized</em> adherence to rule-abiding. The decision was immediately sent by telegram to the pleased French authorities. Nonetheless, the <em>BiS</em> continued to hold meetings with directors from different countries (including fascist Italy) under the pretence of being “strictly impartial and neutral”, a position upheld by Beyen’s replacement, the American McKittrick.</p>\n<p>In the end, it was the US entry into the war in December 1941 which increased the pressure towards the <em>BiS</em> and its officials who continued to operate as if general discussions and meetings with all members (including Italy and Germany) were not only possible, but desirable. Voices within the British Treasury were also increasingly pushing towards an understanding that “the only way of not being outwitted after the war by the defeated Germans is to cut our connection with the <em>BiS</em> now” (Ibid, p. 1299). In the end, however, it was growing US hostility towards the <em>BiS</em> that changed the situation. As a member of the American Treasury Department argued, the <em>BiS</em> was not neutral, as it claimed, but German-controlled, adding that continued relations with the <em>BiS</em> had brought about a situation where “there is an American president doing business with the Germans while our American boys are fighting Germans” (Ibid, p. 1301). The name of this outspoken Treasury member was Harry Dexter White. His hostility towards the <em>BiS</em> would remain unchanged until the end of the war and would resurface during the July 1944 Bretton Woods negotiations: his direct proposal was that the <em>BiS</em> should be liquidated “at the earliest possible moment”.

Published 8 months after the nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia and 3 months after the invasion of Poland, the <em>Kriegsfinanzierung</em> plan followed in the footsteps of the Reichsbank memorandum. Rejecting the prevalent view that the war could be financed through “money creation” at a time of fixed prices (a process that according to them led to a dislocation of economic activity and suppressed inflation), the professors proceeded to suggest a more <em>suitable</em> way for funding the war machine: “War should only be financed by financed through taxes and bonds. The only thing to be decided is the proportion in which these two means of financing can be used [...] We are fully aware that the proposed path requires determination in the implementation of measures that must be perceived as tough. However, it is suitable for averting even greater hardship for the people” (‘Professoren-Kriegzfinanzierunggutacthen’, 9.12.1939, reproduced in Möller (1961) „<em>Zur Vorgeschichte der DM: die Währungsreformpläne 1945-1948</em>”, Kyklos Verlag, Basel, pp. 37, <em>my translation</em>.

The legislation, coming into effect in October 1933, helped to restore the state’s grip on the central bank’s personnel. The general council was abolished. In its place, the country’s president could now appoint the Reichsbank’s president, after hearing the expert opinion of the directorate. The central bank president, for his part, could in turn nominate directorate members who were then appointed by the Reich’s president. Legally speaking, however, the Reichsbank was still independent of government instruction – although such legal independence soon meant little in what emerged to be a totalitarian dictatorship.” Mee 2019: 68 <a href=\"#fnref6\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn7\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>According to a telegram sent to Morgenthau on February 14th 1939, Emil Puhl was “the only one of Schacht’s higher officials who is still in the Reichsbank”, <em>Morgenthau Diaries</em>, Book 164, p. 320. <a href=\"#fnref7\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn8\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>In a special report titled “The Hidden Gold-Reserve Program Initiated by the German Reichsbank during Schacht’s Second Term of Office”, the Division of investigation of Cartels and External Assets of the OMGUS noted: “The purposes of this program are not fully clear, but testimony of the officials questioned has revealed that one of the most important accounts involved was, as least as early as 1937, referred to by officials of the bank as their war reserve. Those questioned agree that the <em>Treuhandgesellschaft</em> account, created by Schacht late in 1935 and amounting to more than twice the published reserves at that time, came to be known by a sort of slogan within the bank as their “new Juliusturm” – a reference to the gold reserve built up for the last war and stored in the Julius Tower in Spandau”.

In 1929, he defended the so-called ‘Treasury view’ in front of the Macmillan Committee. The ‘Treasury view’ was developed in opposition to the views of Lloyd George and JM Keynes who supported that a “loan-financed” public works program was capable of bringing unemployment from 10-11 to 5-6 per cent within a year. Cross examined by Keynes himself during one of the committees’ sessions, Hopkins essentially argued that though there was some evidence that such a scheme would help with unemployment figures, its adoption would set a dangerous precedent of ignoring a balanced budget orientation and the unspoken rule that government expenditure should be sanctioned when it brings a profit. Geared towards increasing competitiveness with an eye on world markets and not on domestic demand, Hopkins would uphold the ‘Treasury view’ despite Keynes’ objections. It was not until 1945 that Hopkins was prepared to accept Keynes’ fundamental inversion of the Treasury View which held that it was saving that determined the level of investment and not vice-versa. But even before that, the achievement of full employment during the war years had convinced both Keynes and Hopkins that there was dire need for a new employment policy to be sketched out. For this reason, Hopkins is credited with intervening for reinstating Keynes as an advisor to the Treasury. By 1944, and after various draft versions of an original paper by James Meade were discussed in a committee chaired by Hopkins, a Keynesian view was adopted and fully backed by Hopkins. Keynes called it a “revolution in official opinion”.

When I use my New York Public Library Card to access a Journal like the Journal of Pension Economics & Finance, I get access through a URL that looks like:\n\n“https://www-cambridge-org.i.ezproxy.nypl.org/core/journals/journal-of-pension-economics-and-finance”\n\nIn this manner an institution like an academic library (or a private firm) can provide individual users the ability to login and read a specific publication through a proxy IP address.

Instead, please have the relevant person/people at your institution email me at crisesnotes@gmail.com. I will provide methods of payment to serious inquiries. I’ll then provide the relevant technical information. UPDATE 5/29/2025: When this article was first written I decided to charge all institutions the same $2500 dollar price. The circumstances of the world and this newsletter have changed so I will now set $2500 dollars as the University/Non-profit rate and $4000 dollars as the \"for-profit\" rate.\n\nInstitutional subscribers are recognized based on their IP addresses. Each institution will need to provide a list of subnets (IP address ranges) that their traffic will come from, so that the server can recognize traffic originating at that institution. Please have your librarian, research or information technology (IT) department contact me, so that I can add the IP address ranges (preferably in the form of what’s called a “netblock”), and ensure that individuals with institutional access can successfully gain access to premium pieces.\n\nThank you for your time and please, spread this announcement far and wide!","html":"<p>Over the years I’ve gotten inquiries about taking on institutional subscriptions.

I do not think it is any secret that I’m not a fan of Donald Trump. At the same time, I’ve generally tried to keep partisan political opinions in this newsletter to a minimum. I try to keep the “politics” of the newsletter squarely focused on policy, while providing broader economic analysis. The discussion of how the economy interacted with the election is a perfect opportunity for me to return to themes I covered in the first year of the newsletter.\n\nOne theme I regularly took up was the fact that congress responded to the Coronavirus pandemic with a series of economic measures which were powerful, but time limited. These covered the gamut, but the most important were the expansions and extensions to unemployment insurance —the direct economic payments (“checks”) and the extensions to medicaid. These programs were important not because they provided “fiscal stimulus”, but because they underpinned households' livelihoods at a difficult time and facilitated “social distancing”. My worry then was that having such large programs on a time limited basis created what I called “fiscal cliffication”. That means politics would increasingly revolve around large fights over what to do as big programs approached their expiration dates — or passed it. As I said in August 2020\n\nWhile this is disastrous for the country at large, the political incentives each party faces are going to lead to intensifying fiscal cliffs for the foreseeable future. Congressional Republican incumbents benefit from instability among lower and middle income households. Voting is deeply tied to residency and housing, which is obviously disrupted by mass evictions. Meanwhile, Democrats can correctly point to Republican obstructionism to drive turnout from their preferred voters — affluent suburbanites.\n\nI normally don’t wade into partisan politics like this, but it is important to get a handle on these dynamics to understand the future of economic policy for the next few years. It was easy to get lulled into a false sense of security by the bipartisanship in the CARES Act — but that was a rare exception. The stars aligned to give both parties an unusual incentive to accomplish an overarching deal quickly. That is now over.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan passed in March 2021, with all republicans voting against it. Of course, by that point discussions of inflation had begun. Inflation then became ever present as a topic, over the course of 2021. I had already begun to focus on this by March 2021, though I wasn’t able to write about it anywhere as much as I wanted to over the following year. \n\nOn March 9th 2021 I sent out an interview I did with Joe Weisenthal for his newsletter with this introduction:\n\nFor a long time now I’ve been thinking about, and foreseeing, a widespread turn to concerns about inflation. Early on in the pandemic I was concerned that supply chain disruptions coming from the abrupt shift to producing in pandemic conditions would lead to an inadequate fiscal response to the pandemic out of inflation concerns. It turned out that those supply chain disruptions were less dire than many feared- but disconcertingly because workplaces tended to not close and let employees bear the burden in the form of illness and death. Meanwhile, debates over the latest Covid relief packages in congress have not really focused on inflation or the availability of physical resources (I’ll have more to say about the latest relief package in the future). Yet we have seen price increases in commodities whose prices are determined on international chartered exchanges and supply chain disruptions have still led to unprecedented delays in deliveries and accumulating unfilled orders.\n\nIt turns out that those commodity prices, along with rent increases, were the center of the growth in measured inflation.\n\nAs I had started to worry about in 2020, the supply chain disruptions and other economic dislocations caused by the rapid changes to production as a result of Covid had led to an abandonment of fiscal policy. Congress drove over those various fiscal cliffs under the assumption that low headline unemployment made these programs unnecessary, while “inflation” made them undesirable. There were also economists, employers and politicians — which included most republicans and many democrats — who openly advocated unwinding unemployment insurance support to compel lower wage workers “back to work”. As the conservative Democratic senator from West Virginia Joe Manchin summarized this attitude, he did not want the U.S. becoming an “entitlement-based society”.\n\nWhich brings us to this election. Joe Biden spent the year he was running for president running on his foreign policy record, as well as his economic record. He emphasized both the superior performance of the U.S. economy relative to other “G7” economies in terms of “real GDP growth”, and low headline unemployment. He also emphasized his record of deficit reduction- a point we will return to. What he did not do was emphasize the economic support he brought to households in 2021 — because nearly all of them would expire by the time he was running for president. The rest would expire over the coming year — student debt payments were even restarted this very September.\n\nThe introduction and then subsequent final expiration of these programs are an extremely underdiscussed element of the election results (though since I started working on this piece, some coverage has emerged). Yes, price increases, particularly those for food, energy and rental housing had a crucial- and continuing — impact on many households, particularly those at the bottom half of the distribution of income. But the income drop off from the expiration of these programs made it a brutal double whammy. It’s important to understand how much these programs reduced both income inequality in the United States, as well as the probability of experiencing income declines.\n\nTo understand this point, we must also understand that statistics which either track an individual person — or individual household’s — economic experiences through time directly are far superior to statistics which take multiple snapshots of a group’s experiences at a point in time. Think of it like musical chairs. If the labor market experience is like endlessly cycling through the first three rounds of musical chairs in an unpredictable sequence — where some chairs are far more uncomfortable than others — then only a minority will be without a chair, or in an uncomfortable chair, at the end of a round. But we can’t conclude from those snapshots that the vast majority of people are having a successful time playing musical chairs. This is even true if the chairs are overall improving in quality. \n\nThis brings me to the work of Jeff Larrimore, Jacob Mortenson, and David Splinter. These government economists — one at the Federal Reserve Board and two from the congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation — have been putting out a series of papers which provide essential insights into how this general volatility of income interacted with the pandemic depression. I first learned of their work from a blog piece written by the economist JW Mason in 2021. In this work, they use Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data to track the incomes of individuals through time. Their January 2023 paper “Earnings Business Cycles: The Covid Recession, Recovery, and Policy Response” updates their results for 2021. I greatly hope they do another follow up paper with the 2022 and 2023 data. In my view, their work holds the key to understanding why the Biden administration’s narrative about the economy — at least when it comes to household wellbeing- was fundamentally misconceived. \n\nConsistent with the musical chairs analogy above, they report that “Over the last two decades, an average of 28 percent of workers had large [earnings] increases and 28 percent had large [earnings] declines each year”. “Large” in this case is defined as a 10 percent change from the previous year. It is very difficult to wrap our minds around such massive labor market volatility. In particular, it's challenging to take the time to truly understand the way fluctuations in aggregate unemployment rates and median wages — even calculated for just the bottom of the workforce- hides this massive labor market “churn”.\n\nAt this point readers might be thinking “if this is going on all the time, what is special about the experience since Covid started?” What is special is that the pandemic greatly impacted the volatility of labor market income and, at the same time, the expansions of the social safety net — particularly unemployment insurance — greatly reduced the volatility of overall income. This is especially the case for the bottom 50% of households, who always have far more volatile incomes than the top 50% of households. This is obvious when you think about it. Decently paying white collar jobs are overwhelmingly salaried, and much more stable than lower income jobs — which tend to pay workers hourly, and fire them easily.\n\nAs is well known, the Coronavirus Depression was unique for being services led. Simply put, the workplaces that needed to shutdown the most were retail outlets, restaurants etc. Economic downturns are generally led by other sectors. This uniqueness also explains why, in labor market terms, the Pandemic Depression was so extraordinarily regressive. Those who were in the bottom of the labor market in 2019 vastly disproportionately lost their jobs or lost labor hours — and thus income. As Larrimore et al. reports:\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, 51 percent of workers who were in the bottom quintile had a large earnings decline. This is 7 percentage points above the 44 percent with large two-year earnings declines from 2017 to 2019. Among the top quintile, the 27 percent of workers with large earnings declines between 2019 and 2021 was 3 percentage points above the share with large earnings declines from 2017 to 2019. Similarly, large earnings increases among the top quintile were 2 percentage points less likely between 2019 and 2021 than in the two preceding years.\n\nRecall that “quintile” is 20% of a group. You can also see how dramatically more unequal this downturn was compared to the Great Financial Crisis in their 2021 paper.\n\n \n\nCompared to 2009, 2020 saw greater declines in labor market incomes among the roughly “bottom” 40% of workers and significantly smaller declines among the top 20%. Increases for the bottom 20% were roughly similar between the Great Financial Crisis and the Pandemic Depression: but beyond that point; the share of workers who had significant earnings increases was substantially greater in 2020; compared to 2009. Which brings us to the role of the pandemic programs shown in these dramatic charts from their 2023 paper.\n\nIn these charts we can see three very important things. First, the absolutely dramatic impact of the pandemic era programs meant that, when you combine them with labor market income, the share of workers experiencing large income declines between 2019 and 2021 was dramatically lower than over 2017 to 2019. In other words, better than a time period when the economy was seen as “good”. Meanwhile the impact on income increases was even more dramatic, with a significantly higher share of workers seeing large income increases; across almost the entire income spectrum. \n\nEnd of Year Sale!\n\nThe key to these dramatic results is that both the “economic impact payments” and the unemployment insurance expansions were done in absolute dollar terms i.e. 1200, 600 & 1400 dollars for the three rounds of checks, Then an additional 600 dollars a week for unemployment insurance were reauthorized at a reduced amount of 300 dollars a week under Biden. This is generally why the impact across the income spectrum declines as you get to higher income groups — by definition 1200 dollars is a smaller percentage of household income as you move up the income ladder. However, clearly the role of additional household dependents in increasing higher income households payments from the direct checks and, in 2021, the child tax credit (CTC) played an important role in sustaining large income gains, until you reach the top 30% of households. \n\nThe second apparent thing is that we can clearly see that the large economic support programs did help make the labor market far more equal between 2020 and 2021. 2020-2021 labor market outcomes are far more like 2018-2019 labor market outcomes than they are 2019-2020 labor market outcomes. Thus, there is a kernel of truth to the Biden narrative about the economy — back in 2021. It is important to note however, that a higher share of workers experienced large income declines in 2021 then in 2019, even if it's only a small difference, and very impressive considering that this happened after an extremely regressive recession caused by a pandemic.\n\nWhich brings us to the third apparent thing: these rosy narratives also look far different when you look at the results over a two year period. A much larger share of workers experienced large earnings declines between 2019 and 2021, then over 2017 to 2019. There is less, but still a significant gap for the workers experiencing large earnings increases between 2019 and 2021, then between 2017 to 2019. Doing better in the labor market than you did in 2020 is not saying all that much, and only partially covered the ground that was lost in 2020. The reason that households' financial wellbeing improved significantly between 2019 and 2021 despite such a dramatically regressive depression is purely because of the pandemic safety net.\n\nThis is all true and we haven’t even discussed the expiration of SNAP (food stamps) or the expiration of the medicaid expansion at the end of March 2023. Medicaid is an absolutely essential program that became even more essential in the pandemic. Hundreds of thousands of people have been disenrolled from Medicaid since March 2023 in crucial swing states alone, far larger than the thin gaps separating Trump and Harris in those states. Policy analyst Stephen Semler created a dramatic chart illustrating the continued wave of program expirations over the course of the Biden administration. It is astounding to look at.\n\nThe expiration of these numerous programs ripped away the insulation from the post-pandemic labor market, which Americans had just in time for energy, food and rent increases to significantly worsen the situation, especially for the bottom 50% of the labor market.\n\nWhich brings us back to price increases. The one weakness of Larrimore and his colleague’s work is that they take their rich microfounded data set and deflate (divide) them by an aggregate price index to produce allegedly “real” numbers. Those “large” increases and decreases of 10% are in “real” terms. This provides no additional information beyond their data, since we are interested in learning about individual households' economic experience beyond the aggregates- and CPI- or PCE- is an aggregate. As my colleague at Employ America Alex Williams presciently pointed out in a late 2021 report entitled “‘Real Wages’ and Aggregation: A Methodological Mess”- adjusting money incomes by an aggregate price index does not actually inform us about the consumption experiences or financial situation of individuals. \n\nEnd of Year Sale!\n\nIn that respect, although money incomes without any reference to changes in money prices of important goods services would also be misleading, so-called “real values” do not actually provide greater information about individual economic circumstances. I would greatly prefer to have their data exercise recreated in purely monetary terms & have them show us how the results change for 5%, 10%, 15% & 20% income increases and declines. Analysts can make qualitative & multidimensional judgments of the impact of price increases in the absence of disaggregated price indices. Nevertheless, the fact that their data is tax return matched is a great improvement over other indicators and tells us roughly the right story even if I think a somewhat different approach would contain even greater insights.\n\nGiven that the price increases which are the most relevant for households budgets, especially the non-elderly among the bottom 50% of households, are food, energy and rent, it is likely that their results overstate the improvement in economic circumstances of lower income households, while overstating the decline in economic circumstances of the top 50%. When the role of program expirations like SNAP and Medicaid are additionally considered, the shift for lower income households is certainly even more dramatically negative.\n\nThese issues also provide us reason to doubt the great importance given to aggregate price indices when assessing the economic sentiments of the vast majority of households. One reason pundits have doubted the impact of “the economy” on the election results is that the growth of the Consumer Price Index slowed considerably from 2022. Besides how many households are disproportionately exposed to price increases in food, energy and rent — the perception of a rent as “high” rather than increasing is clearly far more important. Only a small percentage of people become new tenants each year and this fell precipitously in the pandemic. Thus the dramatic increases in rents in 2021 and 2022 for new tenants are a continuing shock to people renewing leases, or having to move. According to a Federal Reserve Board survey (which I will return to), 27% of renters who moved between roughly the beginning of November 2022 and the beginning of November 2023 moved because of rent increases at their previous home.\n\nIt’s also important to recall that ordinary households do not respect the boundaries of the Bureau of Labor Statistics methodologies. Most Americans are not aware, nor do they care, that mortgage interest rates were removed from price indices by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1983. They also do not care that credit card interest rates are not in these indices either. As far as they are concerned interest rates are a price they pay — and both those interest rates went way up over the past few years. \n\nIt’s also important to remember that CPI and PCE, by their very nature, are weighted to the consumption expenditures of higher income households. That’s because they spend more. The differences between households with a below current market interest rate mortgage, those with market interest rate mortgages, those with no mortgage and renters can be dramatic. The inclusion of “owners equivalent rent” distorts things further, by imputing such large flows of incomes to homeowners and downplaying the good financial circumstances of so many homeowners — especially those with fully paid off homes. Recall that “owner’s equivalent rent” is a construction where government accountants calculate what the “market rent” of owner-occupied housing would be, and assume that homeowners are charging themselves market rents — which they are of course not doing in reality. This income is attributed to them in GDP, and is “weighted” along with actual household expenditures in aggregate price indices.\n\nIn other words, homeowner’s incomes are represented as far higher than they are but all of this “income” goes right into paying “rent” on the “expensive” homes they themselves own- expensive, that is, because it is valuable. Homeowners truly are rapacious landlords to themselves —at least in the offices of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (for now). Don’t misunderstand me — many government economists are aware of the conceptual issues and distortions this accounting gimmick creates. For example, a very good Bureau of Labor Statistics paper from last year provides insight into these problems by exploring the construction of “Housing Cost Indexes” in the United States.\n\nThe main distinctive feature of these indices, besides going back to elements of the pre-1983 approach to housing costs, is that they give every household’s expenditures an equal weight — rather than giving households who spend more greater weights. In their sample 41.4% of households are homeowners with a mortgage, 29.1 are homeowners without a mortgage and 29.6 are renters (this seems to overestimate homeowners a little). Price indices for each of these groups' consumption baskets would clearly diverge significantly (especially since homeowners with paid off mortgages are overwhelmingly elderly). \n\nThe \"relative importance” of different expenditures in their approach, disaggregated in this way, already points to how significantly divergent their spending patterns are — and thus the impact of price increases of various different products. Relative importance is simply an average of what percentage that group of people spend on x or y good or service. However, we don’t actually have price indices to go along with these relative importance “weights”. And the more you disaggregate with current data, the larger the errors become. Data collection methods would have to change to overcome these problems to produce high quality disaggregated price indices that inform us about the outcomes of specific groups. In other words, we would have to oversample a number of subgroups in order to generate accurate data fit for the purpose of giving better insights about the experiences of individual households.\n\nNevertheless, from the evidence we’ve examined so far we can already be fairly certain of a number of things. \n\n 1. Income volatility, especially downwards income volatility, greatly increased when the pandemic era programs expired. \n 2. This was worsened by price increases, especially energy, food and rent increases in 2022 and the rent increases, because of the structure of the rental housing market, continued to impose new economic pain on a growing percentage of renter households even as rents for new tenants stabilized\n 3. Households treat interest rates as a price, and thus to them price increases were even more dramatic in 2022 than the CPI increases. Additionally, similarly to rent, higher interest rates impose continued economic pain on a growing percentage of households as the interest payments remain high, and grow when borrowers need to refinance or new borrowers enter these markets\n 4. Households, particularly lower income households, experienced these salient price increases and high prices, the running through of financial assets accumulated in 2020 and 2021 & the loss of the safety net expansions as a worsening economic situation, regardless of what the headline numbers said.\n\nWhich brings me to the final point of this piece. It is the combination of all these different economic factors which make me very confident in surveys where households report their own economic wellbeing. No, households do not have a very good understanding of aggregate economic indicators, and are wrong to think we are in a recession. On the other hand, as we have seen, the pundits do not have a very good understanding of how aggregate economic indicators relate to individual economic circumstances, so lets call this even. The evidence also seems to suggest that issues like partisanship or media ecosystems mostly impact the perception of what’s happening to others, or in the local or national economy — rather than individuals' perception of their own financial circumstances.\n\nEnter the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED). Each May the Fed puts out a report based on this survey entitled “Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households”. From my point of view, the key question from this survey is “Compared to 12 months ago, would you say that you (and your family) are better off, the same, or worse off financially?” Given these various factors, especially the Larrimore et al. paper, I would expect the answers to this question to be surprisingly muted in 2020, and maybe even outright good in 2021, with a dramatic reversal in 2022 and 2023. And that’s exactly what we find when we look at this data.\n\nEnd of Year Sale!\n\nAs you can see above, the percentage of people who said they were better off than 12 months ago dropped significantly from 2020-2021 to 2022-2023. Most dramatic, however, is the drop off for the percentage of people who said they were worse off. Fourteen additional percent of adults said they were worse off than 12 months ago between 2021 and 2022. This number did not decline significantly in 2023, either. If you treat these statistics as similar to the net favorability polling applied to politicians, we can produce a statistic called a “net better off rating” — the percentage of people who say they are better off financially than a year ago minus the percent who say they are worse off. As you can see above, the “net better off rating” of overall household financial wellbeing dropped a staggering 21 points in 2022. A net better off score of negative 15 points, even negative 11 points, is very bad. Those numbers make running on a “good” economy a catastrophic move. \n\nNor does this seem to be the result of rosy imaginations about the economy under Trump. For one thing, the Larrimore et al. papers make clear that the economy during the first three years of the Trump administration genuinely did have much better labor market outcomes than the economy of the 2020s. That was true in ways hidden by the reliance on statistics like median real wages and headline unemployment rates:\n\nHowever, one-year improvements include mean reversion of prior-year losses, which is why we also consider two-year changes. Over the two-year period from 2019–2021, large earnings increases before fiscal relief were 1 percentage point less common than large earnings declines (34 percent vs. 35 percent). For comparison, in the pre-Covid expansion years from 2017 to 2019, large increases were 7 percentage points more frequent than large decreases.\n\nWhether Trump was responsible for these labor market outcomes, or they reflect a more complete recovery from the Great Financial Crisis after many agonizing years does not change the fact that people are not simply inventing that they had better personal economic circumstances pre-pandemic, once the safety net expansions faded.\n\nOne key sign from these surveys that partisanship or rose-tinted glasses about the prepandemic world are not driving the Federal Reserve survey’s results is that in 2021 the survey asked the same question, except for the change from two years ago rather than one. The result was 36% said they were better off than 2019, and 24% said they were worse off. This comes to a “net better off rating” of +12 which is extraordinarily impressive, when you consider the economic dislocations of Covid. By greatly underestimating the extraordinary power these programs had, pundits and politicians alike have greatly underestimated the effects of their expiration. This meant they didn’t predict the wave of discontentment that would inevitably emerge — and has now emerged.\n\nYou can argue that the safety net expansions, especially after CARES act, were primarily a result of Democrats in the face of Republican opposition. But this is of little relevance if voters are not hearing this narrative, or being told that you are fighting to bring back their economic support. Instead they heard a bevy of information about foreign policy amidst foreign policy crises — and nothing about bringing back these programs. \n\nInstead, once Russia invaded Ukraine, Biden dropped all mention of safety net programs, and started touting his failure to get Build Back Better passed as a success. That means he touted deficit reduction that only happened because of that political failure. Again, policy analyst Stephen Semler has produced another incredible chart of Biden’s rhetorical pivot after the invasion of Ukraine, as expressed through his various twitter accounts. In the absence of a narrative about these economic support programs expiration, voters assume that “someone else” is getting their money —whether it's overseas military spending or “immigrants”. \n\nAll of this is true without even approaching the central question that hung over Biden his entire presidency: his age. If the United States had one consensus during the Biden years, it was that Biden was too old to run for reelection. The last minute switchover to Harris was likely too short to dramatically change messages, or gain credibility as a “change” candidate in a “change” election In fact, it’s that Harris didn’t even really try. This is understandable given the unusual circumstances, but it was electoral poison given that there is nothing like the rage of falling financially behind while being told the “economy” is going great. The Democratic party failed to take advantage of the uniqueness of the U.S. political system. That is, the separation of the legislative and executive branch makes it possible to credibly run as a change candidate, even if you are a member of the same political party as the president. This isn’t true for the rest of the incumbents who lost elections around the world in 2024. \n\nThe good news is, if aggregate economic indicators can be so disconnected from household financial wellbeing, then great expansions of the safety net do not require big increases in overall demand- perhaps even at all. Even 600 dollars a week added back to unemployment insurance would mean far less spending with unemployment rates so low. Meanwhile programs that squarely target poverty are not very expensive. That is, after all, the core meaning of the phrase “social insurance”- to create programs that make catastrophic income declines far less likely. Someone should get on that.\n\nEnd of Year Sale!Printer Friendly Version","html":"<p><em>Announcement: I'm putting on an end of year sale.

Again. I do not think it is any secret that I’m not a fan of Donald Trump. At the same time, I’ve generally tried to keep partisan political opinions in this newsletter to a minimum. I try to keep the “politics” of the newsletter squarely focused on policy, while providing broader economic analysis. The discussion of how the economy interacted with the election is a perfect opportunity for me to return to themes I covered in the first year of the newsletter.</p><p>One theme I regularly took up was the fact that congress responded to the Coronavirus pandemic with a series of economic measures which were powerful, but time limited. These covered the gamut, but the most important were the expansions and extensions to unemployment insurance —the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/much-ado-about-checks/\"><u>direct economic payments</u></a> (“checks”) and the extensions to medicaid. These programs were important not because they provided “fiscal stimulus”, but because they underpinned households' livelihoods at a difficult time and facilitated “social distancing”. My worry then was that having such large programs on a time limited basis created what I called “fiscal cliffication”. That means politics would increasingly revolve around large fights over what to do as big programs approached their expiration dates — or passed it. As I said <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-fiscal-cliffication-of-fiscal/\"><u>in August 2020</u></a></p><blockquote>While this is disastrous for the country at large, the political incentives each party faces are going to lead to intensifying fiscal cliffs for the foreseeable future. Congressional Republican incumbents benefit from instability among lower and middle income households. Voting is deeply tied to residency and housing, which is obviously disrupted by mass evictions. Meanwhile, Democrats can correctly point to Republican obstructionism to drive turnout from their preferred voters — affluent suburbanites.</blockquote><blockquote>I normally don’t wade into partisan politics like this, but it is important to get a handle on these dynamics to understand the future of economic policy for the next few years. It was easy to get lulled into a false sense of security by the bipartisanship in the CARES Act — but that was a rare exception. The stars aligned to give both parties an unusual incentive to accomplish an overarching deal quickly. That is now over.</blockquote><p>The American Rescue Plan passed in March 2021, with all republicans voting against it. Of course, by that point discussions of inflation had begun. Inflation then became ever present as a topic, over the course of 2021. I had already begun to focus on this by March 2021, though I wasn’t able to write about it anywhere as much as I wanted to over the following year.&nbsp;</p><p>On March 9th 2021 I sent out an interview I did with Joe Weisenthal for his newsletter <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-new-frontier-debating-inflation/\"><u>with this introduction</u></a>:</p><blockquote>For a long time now I’ve been thinking about, and foreseeing, a widespread turn to concerns about inflation. Early on in the pandemic I was concerned that supply chain disruptions coming from the abrupt shift to producing in pandemic conditions would lead to an inadequate fiscal response to the pandemic out of inflation concerns. It turned out that those supply chain disruptions were less dire than many feared- but disconcertingly because workplaces tended to not close and let employees bear the burden in the form of illness and death. Meanwhile, debates over the latest Covid relief packages in congress have not really focused on inflation or the availability of physical resources (I’ll have more to say about the latest relief package in the future). Yet we have seen price increases in commodities whose prices are determined on international chartered exchanges and supply chain disruptions have still led to unprecedented delays in deliveries and accumulating unfilled orders.</blockquote><p>It turns out that those commodity prices, along with rent increases, were the center of the growth<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/prices-prices-prices-almost-everything-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-too-annoyed-to-ask/\"> in measured inflation</a>.</p><p>As I had started to worry about in 2020, the supply chain disruptions and other economic dislocations caused by the rapid changes to production as a result of Covid had led to an abandonment of fiscal policy. Congress drove over those various fiscal cliffs under the assumption that low headline unemployment made these programs unnecessary, while “inflation” made them undesirable. There were also <a href=\"https://x.com/jasonfurman/status/1359956563713134593?s=20&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>economists</u></a>, employers and politicians — which included most republicans and many democrats — who openly advocated unwinding unemployment insurance support to compel lower wage workers “back to work”. As the conservative Democratic senator from West Virginia Joe Manchin <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-manchin-chuck-schumer-reconciliation-agreement-july-trillion-entitlement-society-2021-9?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>summarized this attitude</u></a>, he did not want the U.S. becoming an “entitlement-based society”.</p><p>Which brings us to this election. Joe Biden spent the year he was running for president running on his foreign policy record, as well as his economic record. He emphasized both the superior performance of the U.S. economy relative to other “G7” economies in terms of “real GDP growth”, and low headline unemployment. He also emphasized his record of deficit reduction- a point we will return to. What he did not do was emphasize the economic support he brought to households in 2021 — because nearly all of them would expire by the time he was running for president. The rest would expire over the coming year — student debt payments were even restarted this very September.</p><p>The introduction and then subsequent final expiration of these programs are an extremely underdiscussed element of the election results (though since I started working on this piece, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/11/biden-harris-economy-election-loss/680592/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>some coverage has emerged</u></a>). Yes, price increases, particularly those for food, energy and rental housing had a crucial- and continuing — impact on many households, particularly those at the bottom half of the distribution of income. But the income drop off from the expiration of these programs made it a brutal double whammy. It’s important to understand how much these programs reduced both income inequality in the United States, as well as the probability of experiencing income declines.</p><p>To understand this point, we must also understand that statistics which either track an individual person — or individual household’s — economic experiences through time directly are far superior to statistics which take multiple snapshots of a group’s experiences at a point in time. Think of it like musical chairs. If the labor market experience is like endlessly cycling through the first three rounds of musical chairs in an unpredictable sequence — where some chairs are far more uncomfortable than others — then only a minority will be without a chair, or in an uncomfortable chair, at the end of a round. But we can’t conclude from those snapshots that the vast majority of people are having a successful time playing musical chairs. This is even true if the chairs are <strong>overall</strong> improving in quality.&nbsp;</p><p>This brings me to the work of Jeff Larrimore, Jacob Mortenson, and David Splinter. These government economists — one at the Federal Reserve Board and two from the congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation — have been putting out a series of papers which provide essential insights into how this general volatility of income interacted with the pandemic depression. I first learned of their work from a <a href=\"https://jwmason.org/slackwire/earnings-shocks-and-stabilization-during-covid-19/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>blog piece written</u></a> by the economist JW Mason in 2021. In this work, they use Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data to track the incomes of individuals through time. Their <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2023004pap.pdf\"><u>January 2023 paper</u></a> “Earnings Business Cycles: The Covid Recession, Recovery, and Policy Response” updates their results for 2021. I greatly hope they do another follow up paper with the 2022 and 2023 data. In my view, their work holds the key to understanding why the Biden administration’s narrative about the economy — at least when it comes to household wellbeing- was fundamentally misconceived.&nbsp;</p><p>Consistent with the musical chairs analogy above, they report that “Over the last two decades, an average of 28 percent of workers had large [earnings] increases and 28 percent had large [earnings] declines each year”. “Large” in this case is defined as a 10 percent change from the previous year. It is very difficult to wrap our minds around such massive labor market volatility. In particular, it's challenging to take the time to truly understand the way fluctuations in aggregate unemployment rates and median wages — even calculated for just the bottom of the workforce- hides this massive labor market “churn”.</p><p>At this point readers might be thinking “if this is going on all the time, what is special about the experience since Covid started?” What is special is that the pandemic greatly impacted the volatility of labor market income and, at the same time, the expansions of the social safety net — particularly unemployment insurance — greatly <strong>reduced</strong> the volatility of <strong>overall income</strong>. This is especially the case for the bottom 50% of households, who always have far more volatile incomes than the top 50% of households. This is obvious when you think about it. Decently paying white collar jobs are overwhelmingly salaried, and much more stable than lower income jobs — which tend to pay workers hourly, and fire them easily.</p><p>As is well known, the Coronavirus Depression was unique for being services led. Simply put, the workplaces that needed to shutdown the most were retail outlets, restaurants etc. Economic downturns are generally led by other sectors. This uniqueness also explains why, in labor market terms, the Pandemic Depression was so extraordinarily regressive. Those who were in the bottom of the labor market in 2019 vastly disproportionately lost their jobs or lost labor hours — and thus income. As Larrimore et al. reports:</p><blockquote>Between 2019 and 2021, 51 percent of workers who were in the bottom quintile had a large earnings decline. This is 7 percentage points above the 44 percent with large two-year earnings declines from 2017 to 2019. Among the top quintile, the 27 percent of workers with large earnings declines between 2019 and 2021 was 3 percentage points above the share with large earnings declines from 2017 to 2019. Similarly, large earnings increases among the top quintile were 2 percentage points less likely between 2019 and 2021 than in the two preceding years.</blockquote><p>Recall that “quintile” is 20% of a group. You can also see how dramatically more unequal this downturn was compared to the Great Financial Crisis in their 2021 paper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXel8mkVO-yTOx_pTH4BmYlW0ylrbjKAdsqHgP_Cg5cCh99gC69X9tr36OX4VPSGkEQUOs0sOrMwg7-pt9RhiusjbW1ISnFHAVqQ8-srwm9hwXmrOUprgk_HJQRj1iSN2_004AMX8g?key=GtYhRGmkqSiv5trAtGKSZvF2\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"703\"></figure><p>Compared to 2009, 2020 saw greater declines in labor market incomes among the roughly “bottom” 40% of workers and significantly smaller declines among the top 20%. Increases for the bottom 20% were roughly similar between the Great Financial Crisis and the Pandemic Depression: but beyond that point; the share of workers who had significant earnings increases was substantially greater in 2020; compared to 2009. Which brings us to the role of the pandemic programs shown in these dramatic charts from their 2023 paper.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfgVcW4MVzhXMNRRtTNCstlIdqyNTfXZ33Lakjn3RlyJQHgbQG_1agBqD2Nc17Q-xjZnOgA8AWdlm2yf4SMfDNb-p7mriQKyKWJE4zXwwqU54zqmXYnWe1ynxwtY-ij5bTjRLVfeA?key=GtYhRGmkqSiv5trAtGKSZvF2\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"565\"></figure><p>In these charts we can see three very important things. First, the absolutely dramatic impact of the pandemic era programs meant that, when you combine them with labor market income, the share of workers experiencing large income declines between 2019 and 2021 was dramatically lower than over 2017 to 2019. In other words, better than a time period when the economy was seen as “good”. Meanwhile the impact on income increases was even more dramatic, with a significantly higher share of workers seeing large income increases; across almost the entire income spectrum.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">End of Year Sale!</a></div><p>The key to these dramatic results is that both the “economic impact payments” and the unemployment insurance expansions were done in absolute dollar terms i.e. 1200, 600 &amp; 1400 dollars for the three rounds of checks, Then an additional 600 dollars a week for unemployment insurance were reauthorized at a reduced amount of 300 dollars a week under Biden. This is generally why the impact across the income spectrum declines as you get to higher income groups — by definition 1200 dollars is a smaller percentage of household income as you move up the income ladder. However, clearly the role of additional household dependents in increasing higher income households payments from the direct checks and, in 2021, the child tax credit (CTC) played an important role in sustaining large income gains, until you reach the top 30% of households.&nbsp;</p><p>The second apparent thing is that we can clearly see that the large economic support programs did help make the labor market far more equal between 2020 and 2021. 2020-2021 labor market outcomes are far more like 2018-2019 labor market outcomes than they are 2019-2020 labor market outcomes. Thus, <strong>there is a kernel of truth</strong> to the Biden narrative about the economy — back in 2021. It is important to note however, that a higher share of workers experienced large income declines in 2021 then in 2019, even if it's only a small difference, and very impressive considering that this happened after an extremely regressive recession caused by a pandemic.</p><p>Which brings us to the third apparent thing: these rosy narratives also look far different when you look at the results over a two year period. A much larger share of workers experienced large earnings declines between 2019 and 2021, then over 2017 to 2019. There is less, but still a significant gap for the workers experiencing large earnings increases between 2019 and 2021, then between 2017 to 2019. Doing better in the labor market than you did in 2020 is not saying all that much, and only partially covered the ground that was lost in 2020. The reason that households' financial wellbeing improved significantly between 2019 and 2021 despite such a dramatically regressive depression is purely because of the pandemic safety net.</p><p>This is all true and we haven’t even discussed the expiration of SNAP (food stamps) or the expiration of the medicaid expansion at the end of March 2023. Medicaid is an absolutely essential program that became even more essential in the pandemic. Hundreds of thousands of people<a href=\"https://x.com/PhilipRocco/status/1856325014015951180?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> have been disenrolled from Medicaid</u></a> since March 2023 in crucial swing states alone, far larger than the thin gaps separating Trump and Harris in those states. Policy analyst Stephen Semler <a href=\"https://www.stephensemler.com/p/us-child-poverty-nearly-tripled-between?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>created a dramatic chart</u></a> illustrating the continued wave of program expirations over the course of the Biden administration. It is astounding to look at.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcCVO9QR7WH4X4Ne0IwuKnNgUUtWqZGWAuRxUz9s_qAh94ek17jkdmT-_3vj_8vjxT_qVLQtOuA-ZwAR6j-btJpVl_Rr4d6ZixRHCuEZiBLKGsZOqCv_-_EQrjCEGm0XrATXY1hww?key=GtYhRGmkqSiv5trAtGKSZvF2\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"587\"></figure><p>The expiration of these numerous programs ripped away the insulation from the post-pandemic labor market, which Americans had just in time for energy, food and rent increases to significantly worsen the situation, especially for the bottom 50% of the labor market.</p><p>Which brings us back to price increases. The one weakness of Larrimore and his colleague’s work is that they take their rich microfounded data set and deflate (divide) them by an aggregate price index to produce allegedly “real” numbers. Those “large” increases and decreases of 10% are in “real” terms. This provides no additional information beyond their data, since we are interested in learning about individual households' economic experience beyond the aggregates- and CPI- or PCE- is an aggregate. As my colleague at Employ America Alex Williams presciently pointed out <a href=\"https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/real-wages-and-aggregation/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>in a late 2021 report</u></a> entitled “‘Real Wages’ and Aggregation: A Methodological Mess”- adjusting money incomes by an aggregate price index does not actually inform us about the consumption experiences or financial situation of individuals.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">End of Year Sale!</a></div><p>In that respect, although money incomes without any reference to changes in money prices of important goods services would also be misleading, so-called “real values” do not actually provide greater information about individual economic circumstances. I would greatly prefer to have their data exercise recreated in purely monetary terms &amp; have them show us how the results change for 5%, 10%, 15% &amp; 20% income increases and declines. Analysts can make qualitative &amp; multidimensional judgments of the impact of price increases in the absence of disaggregated price indices. Nevertheless, the fact that their data is tax return matched is a great improvement over other indicators and tells us roughly the right story even if I think a somewhat different approach would contain even greater insights.</p><p>Given that the price increases which are the most relevant for households budgets, especially the non-elderly among the bottom 50% of households, are food, energy and rent, it is likely that their results overstate the improvement in economic circumstances of lower income households, while overstating the decline in economic circumstances of the top 50%. When the role of program expirations like SNAP and Medicaid are additionally considered, the shift for lower income households is certainly even more dramatically negative.</p><p>These issues also provide us reason to doubt the great importance given to aggregate price indices when assessing the economic sentiments of the vast majority of households. One reason pundits have doubted the impact of “the economy” on the election results is that the growth of the Consumer Price Index slowed considerably from 2022. Besides how many households are disproportionately exposed to price increases in food, energy and rent — the perception of a rent as “high” rather than increasing is <a href=\"https://x.com/ModeledBehavior/status/1859711171441590393?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>clearly far more important</u></a>. Only a small percentage of people become new tenants each year and this <a href=\"https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/2024/ec-202417-new-tenant-rent-passthrough-and-future-of-rent-inflation?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>fell precipitously in the pandemic</u></a>. Thus the dramatic increases in rents in 2021 and 2022 for new tenants are a continuing shock to people renewing leases, or having to move. According to <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2023-supplement-economic-well-being-us-households-202405.pdf\"><u>a Federal Reserve Board survey</u></a> (which I will return to), 27% of renters who moved between roughly the beginning of November 2022 and the beginning of November 2023 moved because of rent increases at their previous home.</p><p>It’s also important to recall that ordinary households do not respect the boundaries of the Bureau of Labor Statistics methodologies. Most Americans are not aware, nor do they care, that mortgage interest rates <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1982/06/art2full.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>were removed from price indices</u></a> by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1983. They also do not care that credit card interest rates are not in these indices either. As far as they are concerned interest rates are a price they pay — and <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1Bqgf&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>both those interest rates went way up</u></a> over <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1Bqgi&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the past few years</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfw0KGZN1S8oYJca0DlVEVyDYKEnRNSWX1DPwj4B7x6MuD9bdkipG1NnQ_z3v7wTF53XT49DIhybmUjzdKaw7YXCzmtp_cuHnIEBVi0RBOpHx-Q6xqquMwWLLTnDd2gklF515GgOw?key=GtYhRGmkqSiv5trAtGKSZvF2\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"259\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeDt_igBVIqSeSYlCEu08yUoU1LHAx-YjcDn3ROl5aE5xnb9B06xcotbf2M9A_tVfCPXGImJ8oGkSQjgrDDa2sgcH6YGAiXH7NJBdsLiLQODJbXSYBvu2T8YtRuQH1m4cZyzsWHgQ?key=GtYhRGmkqSiv5trAtGKSZvF2\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"259\"></figure><p>It’s also important to remember that CPI and PCE, by their very nature, are weighted to the consumption expenditures of higher income households. That’s because they spend more. The differences between households with a below current market interest rate mortgage, those with market interest rate mortgages, those with <strong>no</strong> mortgage and renters can be dramatic. The inclusion of “owners equivalent rent” distorts things further, by imputing such large flows of incomes to homeowners and downplaying the good financial circumstances of so many homeowners — especially those with fully paid off homes. Recall that “owner’s equivalent rent” is a construction where government accountants calculate what the “market rent” of owner-occupied housing would be, and assume that homeowners are charging themselves market rents — which they are of course not doing in reality. This income is attributed to them in GDP, and is “weighted” along with actual household expenditures in aggregate price indices.</p><p>In other words, homeowner’s incomes are represented as far higher than they are but all of this “income” goes right into paying “rent” on the “expensive” homes they themselves own- expensive, that is, because it is valuable. Homeowners truly are rapacious landlords to themselves —at least in the offices of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (for now). Don’t misunderstand me — many government economists are aware of the conceptual issues and distortions this accounting gimmick creates. For example, a very good Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/osmr/research-papers/2023/pdf/ec230040.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>paper from last year</u></a> provides insight into these problems by exploring the construction of “Housing Cost Indexes” in the United States.</p><p>The main distinctive feature of these indices, besides going back to elements of the pre-1983 approach to housing costs, is that they give every household’s expenditures an equal weight — rather than giving households who spend more greater weights. In their sample 41.4% of households are homeowners with a mortgage, 29.1 are homeowners without a mortgage and 29.6 are renters (this seems to overestimate homeowners a little). Price indices for each of these groups' consumption baskets would clearly diverge significantly (especially since homeowners with paid off mortgages are overwhelmingly elderly).&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfj5Tblyo_Fjh4WZ-ke5qGjaIubuunD-KfWcXP_ANlVzY-ZVPWREDGB-uLk1Xf0HYOFbwxUwzC89hSvTghBZpEy0kbue0UKqzURfgEm17g3Ef7Zy0qt2djQIFsOaWe_B5T_DsUWug?key=GtYhRGmkqSiv5trAtGKSZvF2\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"215\"></figure><p>The \"relative importance” of different expenditures in their approach, disaggregated in this way, already points to how significantly divergent their spending patterns are — and thus the impact of price increases of various different products. Relative importance is simply an average of what percentage that group of people spend on x or y good or service. However, we don’t actually have price indices to go along with these relative importance “weights”. And the more you disaggregate with current data, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/osmr/research-papers/2022/pdf/ec220030.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the larger the errors become</u></a>. Data collection methods would have to change to overcome these problems to produce high quality disaggregated price indices that inform us about the outcomes of specific groups. In other words, we would have to <a href=\"https://www.niskanencenter.org/policy-challenges-from-noisy-subgroups/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>oversample a number of subgroups</u></a> in order to generate accurate data fit for the purpose of giving better insights about the experiences of individual households.</p><p>Nevertheless, from the evidence we’ve examined so far we can already be fairly certain of a number of things.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Income volatility, especially downwards income volatility, greatly increased when the pandemic era programs expired.&nbsp;</li><li>This was worsened by price increases, especially energy, food and rent increases in 2022 and the rent increases, because of the structure of the rental housing market, continued to impose new economic pain on a growing percentage of renter households even as rents for new tenants stabilized</li><li>Households treat interest rates as a price, and thus to them price increases were even more dramatic in 2022 than the CPI increases.

It is the combination of all these different economic factors which make me very confident in surveys where households report their own economic wellbeing. No, households do not have a very good understanding of aggregate economic indicators, and are wrong to think we are in a recession. On the other hand, as we have seen, the pundits do not have a very good understanding of how aggregate economic indicators relate to individual economic circumstances, so lets call this even. The evidence also seems to suggest that issues like partisanship or media ecosystems <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4876787?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>mostly impact</u></a> the perception of what’s happening to others, or in the local or national economy — rather than individuals' perception of their own financial circumstances.</p><p>Enter the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED). Each May the Fed puts out a report <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/report-economic-well-being-us-households.htm\"><u>based on this survey</u></a> entitled “Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households”. From my point of view, the key question from this survey is “Compared to 12 months ago, would you say that you (and your family) are better off, the same, or worse off financially?” Given these various factors, especially the Larrimore et al. paper, I would expect the answers to this question to be surprisingly muted in 2020, and maybe even outright good in 2021, with a dramatic reversal in 2022 and 2023. And that’s exactly what we find when we look at this data.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2024/11/Election-Takeaway-Financially-Worse-off-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1240\" height=\"687\" srcset=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/Election-Takeaway-Financially-Worse-off-1.png 600w, https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/Election-Takeaway-Financially-Worse-off-1.png 1000w, https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2024/11/Election-Takeaway-Financially-Worse-off-1.png 1240w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">End of Year Sale!</a></div><p>As you can see above, the percentage of people who said they were better off than 12 months ago dropped significantly from 2020-2021 to 2022-2023. Most dramatic, however, is the drop off for the percentage of people who said they were <strong>worse off</strong>. Fourteen additional percent of adults said they were worse off than 12 months ago between 2021 and 2022. This number did not decline significantly in 2023, either. If you treat these statistics as similar to the net favorability polling applied to politicians, we can produce a statistic called a “net better off rating” — the percentage of people who say they are better off financially than a year ago minus the percent who say they are worse off. As you can see above, the “net better off rating” of overall household financial wellbeing dropped a staggering 21 points in 2022. A net better off score of negative 15 points, even negative 11 points, is very bad. Those numbers make running on a “good” economy a catastrophic move.&nbsp;</p><p>Nor does this seem to be the result of rosy imaginations about the economy under Trump. For one thing, the Larrimore et al. papers make clear that the economy during the first three years of the Trump administration genuinely did have much better labor market outcomes than the economy of the 2020s. That was true in ways hidden by the reliance on statistics like median real wages and headline unemployment rates:</p><blockquote>However, one-year improvements include mean reversion of prior-year losses, which is why we also consider two-year changes. Over the two-year period from 2019–2021, large earnings increases before fiscal relief were 1 percentage point less common than large earnings declines (34 percent vs. 35 percent). For comparison, in the pre-Covid expansion years from 2017 to 2019, large increases were<strong> 7 percentage points more frequent</strong> than large decreases.</blockquote><p>Whether Trump was responsible for these labor market outcomes, or they reflect a more complete recovery from the Great Financial Crisis after many agonizing years does not change the fact that people are not simply inventing that they had better personal economic circumstances pre-pandemic, once the safety net expansions faded.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe8G7XAJQPGQlb4cPvgYCpmMXkNVIWOzE_u0mDMXXyBFLJnXoRf4O0wN1DdK1XmPD0dVMSp_Fucil4octMmvfzP9Mt3zrZYgkBsWlzq6uxQC3MD7LeqaiuDYuJMh6uqVhipV-c4?key=GtYhRGmkqSiv5trAtGKSZvF2\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"195\"></figure><p>One key sign from these surveys that partisanship or rose-tinted glasses about the prepandemic world are not driving the Federal Reserve survey’s results is that in 2021 the survey asked the same question, except for the change from two years ago rather than one. The result was 36% said they were better off than 2019, and 24% said they were worse off. This comes to a “net better off rating” of +12 which is extraordinarily impressive, when you consider the economic dislocations of Covid. By greatly underestimating the extraordinary power these programs had, pundits and politicians alike have greatly underestimated the effects of their expiration. This meant they didn’t predict the wave of discontentment that would inevitably emerge — and has now emerged.</p><p>You can argue that the safety net expansions, especially after CARES act, were primarily a result of Democrats in the face of Republican opposition. But this is of little relevance if voters are not hearing this narrative, or being told that you are fighting to bring back their economic support. Instead they heard a bevy of information about foreign policy amidst foreign policy crises — and nothing about bringing back these programs.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, once Russia invaded Ukraine, Biden dropped all mention of safety net programs, and started touting his failure to get Build Back Better passed as a success. That means he touted deficit reduction that only happened because of that political failure. Again, policy analyst Stephen Semler has produced <a href=\"https://www.stephensemler.com/p/the-moment-biden-gave-up-on-his-domestic?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>another incredible chart</u></a> of Biden’s rhetorical pivot after the invasion of Ukraine, as expressed through his various twitter accounts. In the absence of a narrative about these economic support programs expiration, voters assume that “someone else” is getting their money —whether it's <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/98111/public_ignorance_or_elitist_jargon_reconsidering_americans_overestimates_of_government_waste_and_foreign_aid.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>overseas military spending</u></a> or “immigrants”.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc3RYr-i8ZWnz0tw8BYScbZskV29zasjO_A8HlR3AZitne7cSupOMxVzsk-50rMP3si00B-itfTUCf4iOZvQSrVHmu7iBe9Dt4dX6F0mGxtMQQK3yDJWn3AbUm0OSuPaAHYF2kn?key=GtYhRGmkqSiv5trAtGKSZvF2\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"621\"></figure><p>All of this is true without even approaching the central question that hung over Biden his entire presidency: his age. If the United States had one consensus during the Biden years, it was that Biden was too old to run for reelection. The last minute switchover to Harris was likely too short to dramatically change messages, or gain credibility as a “change” candidate in a “change” election In fact, it’s that Harris didn’t even really try. This is understandable given the unusual circumstances, but it was electoral poison given that there is nothing like the rage of falling financially behind while being told the “economy” is going great. The Democratic party failed to take advantage of the uniqueness of the U.S. political system. That is, the separation of the legislative and executive branch makes it possible to credibly run as a change candidate, even if you are a member of the same political party as the president. This isn’t true for the rest of the incumbents <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8ac09ea-c300-4249-af7d-109003afb893?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>who lost elections around the world in 2024</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is, if aggregate economic indicators can be so disconnected from household financial wellbeing, then great expansions of the safety net do not require big increases in overall demand- perhaps even at all. Even 600 dollars a week added back to unemployment insurance would mean far less spending with unemployment rates so low. Meanwhile programs that squarely target poverty are not very expensive. That is, after all, the core meaning of the phrase “social insurance”- to create programs that make catastrophic income declines far less likely. Someone should get on that.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">End of Year Sale!</a></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2024/11/One-Election-Takeaway-Voters-Hate-Temporary-Safety-Nets.pdf\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Printer Friendly Version</a></div>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/one-election-takeaway-voters-hate-temporary-safety-nets/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"e7a92989-4810-4e31-bc33-8439ad2a13e7","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"673b2209875e4a00013fc50a","reading_time":19}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"November 19","id":"Ghost__Post__673c7cc94ca33100010e101d","title":"Here Are the 30,000 Pages of Federal Reserve Board Meeting Minutes I Got Through FOIA.

I would like to thank John Jay student Josie-Grace Valerius for her invaluable yeoman’s work helping to construct a usable and organized database from this mass of meetings\n\nSubscribe\n\nFor the past year and a half I’ve increasingly focused on using FOIA to scrutinize the Federal Reserve. Before I unveil the crown jewel of what I’ve accomplished so far, I think it's worth stepping back and saying why I’ve undertaken such a broad project. The Federal Reserve is a massive and extremely significant institution. While the basics of monetary policy reach the headlines, it's also a financial regulator, payments provider, and enforcer of a myriad of national security laws, regulations and executive orders. The fact that it is not subject to annual congressional appropriations gives it unique powers and ability to act. The Fed also has significant and unique immunities to the public accountability laws of this country. \n\nMany are looking to Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve to be the “adults in the room” in the Trump administration. Moments of uncertainty can prompt people to turn to conventional “checks and balances” on the executive. But in crucial ways, the Federal Reserve has never shown the remotest “independence” when it comes to being an instrument of national security laws, or executive decisions. (Later this week I will be publishing my assessment of how “the economy” interacted with the election result)\n\nAnyway, reporters usually follow the horse race of interest rate decisions and passing scandals. But the more I looked, the more I found that important decisions were going unnoticed and unscrutinized. My goal in using FOIA is to better understand the Federal Reserve as an institution: to focus on what is important but rarely makes it to the headlines.\n\nI’ve explored a lot of different angles, when I began to expand the scope of my FOIA investigations into the Federal Reserve System. I looked for requests that would be valuable but also seemingly easy to fulfill. I scoured documents for references to materials that had yet been uncovered. However, there was one topic that was so blindingly obvious, it felt strange that transparency on this issue could even conceivably fall to me. I was armed with nothing more than the Freedom of Information Act, a rolodex of media contacts and a moderately sized platform. Nevertheless, this has ended up being my responsibility: the meetings of the Federal Reserve Board (technically called “The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System”).\n\nLet me provide a brief refresher of the Federal Reserve “system’s” structure. The Federal Reserve System has three major components: The Board of Governors in D.C., The twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks and the Federal Open Market Committee. The Committee is a unique blend of both institutions in that all seven Governors from the Board are on the FOMC, while a rotating cast of Reserve Bank Presidents make up the other five slots. This structure has been endlessly debated since its creation in 1935, so I will sidestep such questions today. Those interested in the more conventional debates about reforming the Fed can check out the “secret” books I got from the Federal Reserve Board using FOIA. The majority of these volumes, written by the Federal Reserve’s highly influential general counsel Howard Hackley, pertain to the most common proposals for reform. Most significantly for my purposes today, Federal Reserve Banks are not subject to FOIA.\n\nRather than focus on changing the current structure of the Federal Reserve System, I’m focusing on a narrower issue which is subtly important: the shockingly uneven degree of transparency between the FOMC and the Board of Governors. Specifically, we received transcripts from FOMC meetings on a five year delay. The minutes for FOMC meetings are released three weeks after the meeting. When do we get transcripts of closed Board of Governors meetings? Well, never.When do we get minutes of closed Board of Governors meetings? Well, also never. The last publicly available minutes of Board of Governors meetings—prior to this piece— is from December 1966. You read that right. To emphasize how out of date that is, they would have to publicly release 154 additional months to catch the public up to the day that Volcker launched the “Volcker Shock”. To be sure, some more recent excerpts from the minutes are available here and there on the internet because of FOIA.\n\nThe most important of these are a set of minutes that the Yale Program on Financial Stability managed to get regarding the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2009. But these examples are scattered, uneven and in various different stages of completeness. Some material I don’t have access to, despite the fact that FOIA Logs show “fully granted” requests for those materials (ironically this information was also released by FOIA requests). I would have to duplicate their FOIA requests to get what they got, and who knows when they would fulfill those requests. So I plan on getting to that (how long it takes will remain to be seen!) \n\nBut for now, I’ve gotten something of incredible value. To my great surprise, the Federal Reserve responded to my request for “Board of Governor meeting minutes from 1967 to the end of 1973”, which I made on November 16th 2023 in full. They arrived on three separate Compact Disks- yes CDs! There is only one page of these nearly 30,000 pages, which is redacted. It seems to be related to a criminal case in New Orleans, which is not of macroeconomic or institutional interest.\n\nAs I've already written about, these minutes include quite amazing stories. They include how the Federal Reserve nearly repealed its own “emergency” lending powers. Or how it came right up to the edge of bailing out the Saving & Loan industry in 1973. I’ve got more to say about these topics. I’ve also got so much more to write about these 30,000 pages of Board minutes — which have so many fascinating and untold insights. One I will be covering before the end of the year is the new light the minutes shed on Penn Central, the railroad failure which can be considered the beginning of the Fed’s institutional and legal development of its 13(3) lending powers. Indeed this leads directly to the development of the “too big to fail” doctrine, a term first coined 40 years ago for the failure of the bank Continental Illinois.\n\nSubscribe\n\nMy overall goal is to get the Federal Reserve to release all the meeting minutes up to the “deliberative process exemption”, which applies to the past 25 years. As of January 1st 2025, that would mean releasing all the minutes documenting meetings held in the last millennium. Despite releasing seven years of minutes to me this spring, my follow up request was quickly denied for not being a “valid request”. That was despite being identical to the past one. I currently have an appeal out, arguing that at the very least I should be allowed to narrow my request to a year, even six months of minutes rather than having it thrown out entirely. This is going to be an ongoing and effortful project — but I am hopeful I will continue to find success. (If that means suing, so be it!)\n\nThe sensitive legal issues that the Board of Governors deals with could arguably justify a greater lag time for releasing information about these closed door meetings. However, we are not getting releases on a larger delay than the FOMC materials. We aren’t getting them at all. What we do get are dribs and drabs through FOIA — which are not consistently stored in any single place. Since the Federal Reserve is not providing that consistent place, I have decided to step in. My goal is to do whatever I can to populate this database with as many documents as possible. \n\nBut all that takes time, effort and resources. It doesn’t matter whether you believe the Federal Reserve is an important institution keeping Trump from doing even greater damage to the country, or you believe that the Federal Reserve is illegitimately standing in the way of either progressive policies or the president elect’s agenda. Regardless: holding the Federal Reserve accountable to the public and increasing its transparency could not be more important. So please take out a paid subscription to support this work if you have not already done so. (To those who have — thank you very much for your support!)\n\nOnto the database itself. I will be housing search, as well as a full listing of direct links to the meeting pdfs, at crisesnotes.com/database. You can also find the search bar, which is embedded in the database page, at the link search.crisesnotes.com. Over time I will improve the layout and design of the database page and eventually I will make this a more general purpose database which hosts all of my FOIA successes as well as the documents I’ve accumulated from the national archives. There is quite a lot of important material in there too- especially on the relationship of national security to the Federal Reserve. Finally, I would like to make a special mention of Josie-Grace Valerius, a student who provided invaluable help making these minutes into an organized and structured database. Thank you for reading and I look forward to bringing many thousands of more pages to light.\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><em>Technical issues that took significantly greater time to work out than I expected caused the delay of this database — but I’m proud to release it today.

They arrived on three separate Compact Disks- yes CDs! There is only one page of these nearly 30,000 pages, which is redacted. It seems to be related to a criminal case in New Orleans, which is not of macroeconomic or institutional interest.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdPwmP2ZpgPLjIZiuSjrve2batPpHu1WtfjnklxFKzX2WxUGgvn_b51bBcOTgqUcaRiU_LHukHwsYxWwToIUQtyV85NDQ7Y528Obc9jKPailVbW5fLJgFwdTe0-b1HQeeob22l45laLwplVFk0ymdZKJ3e0?key=w6Oxk4NFaM77UfSGdPlyNw\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"512\"></figure><p>As I've already written about, these minutes include quite amazing stories. They include how the Federal Reserve nearly repealed its own <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/from-relic-to-indispensable-how-the-federal-reserve-nearly-gave-up-its-emergency-lending-powers-in-1967/\"><u>“emergency” lending powers</u></a>. Or how it came <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/revealed-the-federal-reserves-secret-1973-plan-to-bailout-the-saving-loan-industry-that-very-nearly-happened/\"><u>right up to the edge </u></a>of bailing out the Saving &amp; Loan industry in 1973. I’ve got more to say about these topics. I’ve also got so much more to write about these 30,000 pages of Board minutes — which have so many fascinating and untold insights. One I will be covering before the end of the year is the new light the minutes shed on Penn Central, the railroad failure which can be considered the beginning of the Fed’s institutional and legal development of its 13(3) lending powers. Indeed this leads directly to the development of the “too big to fail” doctrine, a term first coined 40 years ago for the failure of the bank Continental Illinois.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>My overall goal is to get the Federal Reserve to release all the meeting minutes up to the “deliberative process exemption”, which applies to the past 25 years. As of January 1st 2025, that would mean releasing all the minutes documenting meetings held in the last millennium. Despite releasing seven years of minutes to me this spring, my follow up request was quickly denied for not being a “valid request”. That was despite being identical to the past one. I currently have an appeal out, arguing that at the very least I should be allowed to narrow my request to a year, even six months of minutes rather than having it thrown out entirely. This is going to be an ongoing and effortful project <em>— </em>but I am hopeful I will continue to find success. (If that means suing, so be it!)</p><p>The sensitive legal issues that the Board of Governors deals with could arguably justify a greater lag time for releasing information about these closed door meetings. However, we are not getting releases on a larger delay than the FOMC materials. We aren’t getting them at all. What we do get are dribs and drabs through FOIA <em>—</em> which are not consistently stored in any single place. Since the Federal Reserve is not providing that consistent place, I have decided to step in. My goal is to do whatever I can to populate this database with as many documents as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>But all that takes time, effort and resources. It doesn’t matter whether you believe the Federal Reserve is an important institution keeping Trump from doing even greater damage to the country, or you believe that the Federal Reserve is illegitimately standing in the way of either progressive policies or the president elect’s agenda. Regardless: holding the Federal Reserve accountable to the public and increasing its transparency could not be more important. So please take out a paid subscription to support this work if you have not already done so. (To those who have — thank you very much for your support!)</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfJvX8LCoGNr-GH_OwF6QGnxVGTFg-LLVQgsqRebpGxA7CosGXKlhdGPisJf3pxWMbxuF0PKZL03Z0oFphV38wGUBeG9jn18-Cq3TvAr-7H2fyYQHleiJpHtZE0ns8em7Yansq6oA?key=w6Oxk4NFaM77UfSGdPlyNw\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"576\" height=\"802\"></figure><p>Onto the database itself.

You can also find the search bar, which is embedded in the database page, at the link <a href=\"https://search.crisesnotes.com/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>search.crisesnotes.com</u></a>. Over time I will improve the layout and design of the database page and eventually I will make this a more general purpose database which hosts all of my FOIA successes as well as the documents I’ve accumulated from the national archives. There is quite a lot of important material in there too- especially on the relationship of national security to the Federal Reserve. Finally, I would like to make a special mention of Josie-Grace Valerius, a student who provided invaluable help making these minutes into an organized and structured database.

More generally, I am going to write quite a lot in the coming months on what I’ve unearthed in all that research. I hope that you will stick with me in this process.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAs readers are well aware by now, I’ve become increasingly obsessed with the Freedom of Information Act, and using it to scrutinize the Federal Reserve System. I’ve been fairly successful so far, getting important memos and now even multiple books (previously unpublished). It would be fair to say that I’m the single individual most focused on using FOIA to examine the Federal Reserve. There are, of course, companies and law firms who specialize in FOIA requests of government agencies. I have many FOIA requests in process, and my next piece will be about a very interesting (and neglected) area of the Federal Reserve: the Board of Governors meeting. That piece will be framed around the 1967-1973 Board of Governors minutes, which I won through a FOIA request. In that piece I will also release them to the public — for free.\n\nYet, as successful as I have been at using FOIA regarding the Federal Reserve, I didn’t have the biggest Freedom of Information victory against the Federal Reserve System in 2023 (that had to wait for this year). Not by a long shot. The biggest victory on this front was instead accomplished by finance professor Emre Kuvvet. He got the index to the elusive “Doomsday Book” of the New York Federal Reserve. Yes, really: They themselves named it the “Doomsday Book”. More incredibly, in June 2006 they created a cover letter, written in Comic Sans. It is surreal, to say the least, to read “The Doomsday Book, however, assumes working computers and printers” written in Comic Sans.\n\nProfessor Kuvvet publicly revealed his “Freedom of Information” request success in a Wall Street Journal article entitled “Sun Shines on Fed ‘Doomsday Book’” on December 11th of last year. So what exactly is this “Doomsday Book”? Despite the dramatic name, its actual content is a long list of mostly legal memoranda, which explain the expansive powers of the Federal Reserve. More rarely, they set out its limits. I say that the Doomsday Book is only “partially” revealed, because while what professor Kuvvet got was quite valuable, he didn’t actually get the legal memos themselves. Instead, what he got was something like an “annotated bibliography”. It explains what powers the Federal Reserve “theoretically” has, and which legal opinions justify those interpretations. But it only provides a cursory understanding of what the legal memos themselves say. You can read a searchable version I’ve made of the Doomsday Book here.\n\nThe Doomsday Book first became public knowledge because of former New York Fed president and Obama Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner’s memoir. The fact that it existed captured the imagination of a public still angry over the 2008 bailouts. We learned more about this issue when AIG—who had the chutzpah to sue the Federal Reserve because its demand for nearly 80% of the company’s equity in exchange for billions of loans to save it—tried to get access to the Doomsday Book in legal discovery, and had former secretary Geithner testify about it.\n\nThe partial revelation of the New York Fed’s Doomsday Book set off a lot of furious labor on my part. I submitted over 120 FOIA requests related to the Doomsday Book, and I still have a number of these requests outstanding. I have also sent a few more requests here and there, and will likely continue to make requests based on the Doomsday book as they occur to me. Unfortunately, the vast majority of my requests were rejected because they were determined to be “Federal Reserve Bank of New York” records, rather than records of any recognized government agency. The legal issues surrounding the “agency status” of Federal Reserve Banks are extremely interesting and extremely complex, too complex in fact to get into in this piece. Suffice to say, the ability to shield the Federal Reserve System from FOIA scrutiny through generating the relevant records at the Federal Reserve Banks is an extremely troubling and problematic aspect of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSubscribe\n\nIn a certain sense, the requests informing me that something was a New York Federal Reserve record were still helpful because it confirmed, by omission or alternative response, what requests were indeed Federal Reserve Board records. Unfortunately, simply because a record is (currently) subject to FOIA does not mean I will get access to them. Recently, I got a number of rejections on the premise that the memos in question were exempt because of “attorney client privilege”. As the FOIA.gov website explains, this falls under the fifth exemption to FOIA:\n\n\n\n\nExemption 5: Privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by the:\n\n\n 1. Deliberative Process Privilege (provided the records were created less than 25 years before the date on which they were requested)\n 2. Attorney-Work Product Privilege\n 3. Attorney-Client Privilege\n\n\n\nI mostly requested material from 25 years or older in order to avoid the deliberative process part of this exemption. However, as I knew from the beginning, there was always a chance of being denied everything. That’s because of the ability to invoke Attorney-Client privilege.\n\nThat’s part of a bigger picture: the ability to shield crucial interpretative issues in public policy under the banner of “attorney-client privilege” is a huge barrier to the effectiveness of FOIA. The disability the Deliberative Process exemption created for FOIA is what led to its limitation to a 25 year period in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016. We need a similar limitation on invoking attorney client privilege. Answering general questions about one’s legal interpretation of the limits of the Federal Reserve act is not a matter of privacy, the way sending a memo on a specific court case is.\n\nSubscribe\n\nWhat’s especially amazing about this is the kind of material I’m getting denied. They denied me a 1975 memo on emergency lending which has been superseded in all sorts of ways in more recent decades. \n\n“Direct Extension of Emergency Credit to a Nonmember Bank or Bank Holding Company on its Own Note” (FLO0S588) 01/17/75\n\nThey denied me a 1978 memo about whether the Fed had the legal authority to pay interest on reserves. The Fed of course got authorizing legislation to pay interest on reserves in 2006. What could be in this memo that’s still sensitive? I actually know a lot about the circumstances surrounding this fight over interest on reserves in 1978, and plan to write about that more in the future.\n\n“Authority of Board to pay interest on required reserves of member banks” dated 06/19/1978\n\nThey also denied me a memo about the Fed’s legal authority to “independently” buy and sell foreign currencies from 1981.\n\n“Authority of Federal Reserve to engage independently in foreign exchange transactions” (#212904) 09/14/81[.]\n\nMost understandably, but also tantalizingly, they denied me a memo about the New York Fed engaging in negotiations with the Mexican government over refinancing the Treasury’s lending to Mexico.\n\n“Potential Request of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to Commence Negotiations in Connection with the Proposed Refinancing of a Portion of the Loans Extended to the United Mexican States by the U.S. Treasury(#335556) 05/24/96[.”]\n\nI haven’t given up on these memos. I will come up with legal arguments—with help from others—on why they should be released to me. But the reality is that overcoming the invocation of “attorney client privilege” is very difficult. There’s a reason they invoke it, after all.\n\nStill, the commentary in the “Doomsday Book” is itself extremely valuable and informative. The most important commentary in the entire Doomsday Book is a concise summary of the Federal Reserve’s lending “powers” and the New York Federal Reserve’s legal assessment of them:\n\n\n\n\nThe lending authority opinions are the most important. A constant theme runs through them all: the powers of a Federal Reserve Bank are far greater than is commonly supposed. The following bullet points capture the headlines of these opinions:\n\n\n * \n   \n   \n   Reserve Banks may extend Section 10B credit on a non-recourse basis. This permits back-to-back Section 10B lending, perhaps as an alternative to Section 13(3) discounting. (The need for this has decreased with the 2001 amendments to the Federal Reserve Act that relaxed the Board quorum requirement for Section 13(3) discounting.) This power also permits Reserve Banks to provide price support in a panicking market, by extending nonrecourse loans based solely on collateral. This is tantamount to purchasing the collateral, with a repurchase option: an effective means of price support.\n   \n\n * \n   \n   \n   Section 13(3) lending has fewer constraints than one might think.\n   \n   \n   * The Board can pre-authorize a Reserve Bank to lend under Section 13(3) at the Reserve Bank’s discretion, without disclosing this pre-authorization to the public.\n   * Section 13(3) lending to banks might be permissible, without the liability scheme imposed by Section 10B, as amended by FDICIA.\n   * Section 13(3) lending authority extends to municipalities. (There is no opinion on file extending this result to states or foreign governments.) There is also an independent Section 14(b)(1) lending authority for municipalities.\n   * Section 13(3) credit may be extended to Federal Home Loan Banks, notwithstanding language in Section 14(b)(2) of the Federal Reserve Act.\n   * Section 13(3) credit can be extended on the note of the obligor. (This has been generally accepted since the memo of [redacted] 1975, but it is useful to have a copy of the memo on hand.\n   \n\n\n\nSome of these bullet points I will explain at a later time. For now, what’s important is that the New York Federal Reserve took it as fact that the Federal Reserve had the legal authority to lend to municipalities using both 13(3) (its key expansive lending powers) — and its 14(b)(1) lending authority. This municipality point is especially extraordinary to me, because I made this precise legal argument at length in a piece I wrote on September 6th 2020 titled “Is It Legal For The Federal Reserve To Provide State & Local Governments Unlimited Credit Lines?” I could never imagine that my radical argument, an argument that has never been confirmed as true by any official source, was stated as a matter of fact in the New York Federal Reserve’s Doomsday Book. As I’ve been vindicated (to say the least) I will be returning to this issue in the future.\n\nAnother intriguing thing is that an entire bullet point is devoted to the 1975 memo I was denied on Attorney Client Privilege grounds. Nearly 50 years later, this key piece of the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending legal architecture is apparently too explosive for public view.\n\nThere’s simply too much in these 122 pages to discuss in this one piece. I will be relying on its content for years to come. On its own, it completely rewrites significant aspects of the Federal Reserve’s history. Even when the Doomsday Book doesn’t rewrite Federal Reserve history, it provides far more detail than you can get in any other source. This trove opens up so many fascinating research questions. \n\nUnfortunately, the combination of the overly expansive use of the attorney client privilege exemption and the improper shielding of Federal Reserve Banks from FOIA will greatly inhibit pursuing these research questions. Most importantly, it keeps the legal history of the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending authority far too secret from the public — and thus to scrutiny. Luckily, the 30,000 pages of Board of Governors Minutes I got recently can help let in a little bit more light. We’ll talk about that next time — and for many years to come.\n\nSubscribe","html":"<p><em>I apologize for my long absence.

As the FOIA.gov <a href=\"https://www.foia.gov/faq.html?ref=crisesnotes.com#:~:text=Exemption%205%3A\"><u>website explains</u></a>, this falls under the fifth exemption to FOIA:</p><blockquote>\n<p><strong>Exemption 5:</strong> Privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by the:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deliberative Process Privilege (provided the records were created less than 25 years before the date on which they were requested)</li>\n<li>Attorney-Work Product Privilege</li>\n<li>Attorney-Client Privilege</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I mostly requested material from 25 years or older in order to avoid the deliberative process part of this exemption. However, as I knew from the beginning, there was always a chance of being denied everything. That’s because of the ability to invoke Attorney-Client privilege.</p><p>That’s part of a bigger picture: the ability to shield crucial interpretative issues in public policy under the banner of “attorney-client privilege” is a huge barrier to the effectiveness of FOIA. The disability the Deliberative Process exemption created for FOIA is what led to its limitation to a 25 year period in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016. <strong>We need a similar limitation on invoking attorney client privilege.</strong> Answering general questions about one’s legal interpretation of the limits of the Federal Reserve act is not a matter of privacy, the way sending a memo on a specific court case is.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>What’s especially amazing about this is the kind of material I’m getting denied. They denied me a 1975 memo on emergency lending which has been superseded in all sorts of ways in more recent decades.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“Direct Extension of Emergency Credit to a Nonmember Bank or Bank Holding Company on its Own Note” (FLO0S588) 01/17/75</blockquote><p>They denied me a 1978 memo about whether the Fed had the legal authority to pay interest on reserves. The Fed of course got authorizing legislation to pay interest on reserves in 2006. What could be in this memo that’s still sensitive? I actually know a lot about the circumstances surrounding this fight over interest on reserves in 1978, and plan to write about that more in the future.</p><blockquote>“Authority of Board to pay interest on required reserves of member banks” dated 06/19/1978</blockquote><p>They also denied me a memo about the Fed’s legal authority to “independently” buy and sell foreign currencies from 1981.</p><blockquote>“Authority of Federal Reserve to engage independently in foreign exchange transactions” (#212904) 09/14/81[.]</blockquote><p>Most understandably, but also tantalizingly, they denied me a memo about the New York Fed engaging in negotiations with the Mexican government over refinancing the Treasury’s lending to Mexico.</p><blockquote>“Potential Request of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to Commence Negotiations in Connection with the Proposed Refinancing of a Portion of the Loans Extended to the United Mexican States by the U.S. Treasury(#335556) 05/24/96[.”]</blockquote><p>I haven’t given up on these memos. I will come up with legal arguments—with help from others—on why they should be released to me. But the reality is that overcoming the invocation of “attorney client privilege” is very difficult. There’s a reason they invoke it, after all.</p><p>Still, the commentary in the “Doomsday Book” is itself extremely valuable and informative. The most important commentary in the entire Doomsday Book is a concise summary of the Federal Reserve’s lending “powers” and the New York Federal Reserve’s legal assessment of them:</p><blockquote>\n<p>The lending authority opinions are the most important. A constant theme runs through them all: the powers of a Federal Reserve Bank are far greater than is commonly supposed. The following bullet points capture the headlines of these opinions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Reserve Banks may extend Section 10B credit on a non-recourse basis. This permits back-to-back Section 10B lending, perhaps as an alternative to Section 13(3) discounting. (The need for this has decreased with the 2001 amendments to the Federal Reserve Act that relaxed the Board quorum requirement for Section 13(3) discounting.) This power also permits Reserve Banks to provide price support in a panicking market, by extending nonrecourse loans based solely on collateral. This is tantamount to purchasing the collateral, with a repurchase option: an effective means of price support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Section 13(3) lending has fewer constraints than one might think.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Board can pre-authorize a Reserve Bank to lend under Section 13(3) at the Reserve Bank’s discretion, without disclosing this pre-authorization to the public.</li>\n<li>Section 13(3) lending to banks might be permissible, without the liability scheme imposed by Section 10B, as amended by FDICIA.</li>\n<li>Section 13(3) lending authority extends to municipalities. (There is no opinion on file extending this result to states or foreign governments.) There is also an independent Section 14(b)(1) lending authority for municipalities.</li>\n<li>Section 13(3) credit may be extended to Federal Home Loan Banks, notwithstanding language in Section 14(b)(2) of the Federal Reserve Act.</li>\n<li>Section 13(3) credit can be extended on the note of the obligor. (This has been generally accepted since the memo of [redacted] 1975, but it is useful to have a copy of the memo on hand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some of these bullet points I will explain at a later time. For now, what’s important is that the New York Federal Reserve took it as fact that the Federal Reserve had the legal authority to lend to municipalities using both 13(3) (its key expansive lending powers) — <strong>and</strong> its 14(b)(1) lending authority. This municipality point is especially extraordinary to me, because I made this precise legal argument at length in a piece <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-it-legal-for-the-federal-reserve/\"><u>I wrote on September 6th 2020</u></a> titled “Is It Legal For The Federal Reserve To Provide State &amp; Local Governments Unlimited Credit Lines?” I could never imagine that my radical argument, an argument that has never been confirmed as true by any official source, was stated as a matter of fact in the New York Federal Reserve’s Doomsday Book. As I’ve been vindicated (to say the least) I will be returning to this issue in the future.</p><p>Another intriguing thing is that an entire bullet point is devoted to the 1975 memo I was denied on Attorney Client Privilege grounds. Nearly 50 years later, this key piece of the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending legal architecture is apparently too explosive for public view.</p><p>There’s <strong>simply too much in these 122 pages to discuss in this one piece. </strong>I will be relying on its content for years to come. On its own, it completely rewrites significant aspects of the Federal Reserve’s history. Even when the Doomsday Book doesn’t rewrite Federal Reserve history, it provides far more detail than you can get in any other source. This trove opens up so many fascinating research questions.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the combination of the overly expansive use of the attorney client privilege exemption and the improper shielding of Federal Reserve Banks from FOIA will greatly inhibit pursuing these research questions. Most importantly, it keeps the legal history of the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending authority far too secret from the public — and thus to scrutiny. Luckily, the 30,000 pages of Board of Governors Minutes I got recently can help let in a little bit more light. We’ll talk about that next time — and for many years to come.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-new-york-federal-reserves-doomsday-book-has-been-partially-revealed/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"773e40b9-3d84-4ba1-aa10-b97f1453c64a","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"66a268aa45771f000167cbde","reading_time":8}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"February 6","id":"Ghost__Post__65c19372b2a5d800010b389e","title":"Revealed: The Seven Secret Federal Reserve Books I Won Through FOIA","slug":"revealed-the-seven-secret-federal-reserve-books-i-won-through-foia","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2024/02/RevealedThe-Seven-Secret-Federal-Reserve-Books-I-Won-Through-FOIA.jpg","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b80808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/20222d0337c22158464197c24d2b4734/63285/RevealedThe-Seven-Secret-Federal-Reserve-Books-I-Won-Through-FOIA.jpg","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/20222d0337c22158464197c24d2b4734/60e6d/RevealedThe-Seven-Secret-Federal-Reserve-Books-I-Won-Through-FOIA.jpg 400w,\n/migrantinsider/static/20222d0337c22158464197c24d2b4734/3ec54/RevealedThe-Seven-Secret-Federal-Reserve-Books-I-Won-Through-FOIA.jpg 800w,\n/migrantinsider/static/20222d0337c22158464197c24d2b4734/63285/RevealedThe-Seven-Secret-Federal-Reserve-Books-I-Won-Through-FOIA.jpg 1600w","sizes":"(min-width: 1600px) 1600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/20222d0337c22158464197c24d2b4734/dccb0/RevealedThe-Seven-Secret-Federal-Reserve-Books-I-Won-Through-FOIA.webp 400w,\n/migrantinsider/static/20222d0337c22158464197c24d2b4734/35be4/RevealedThe-Seven-Secret-Federal-Reserve-Books-I-Won-Through-FOIA.webp 800w,\n/migrantinsider/static/20222d0337c22158464197c24d2b4734/39c2d/RevealedThe-Seven-Secret-Federal-Reserve-Books-I-Won-Through-FOIA.webp 1600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1600px) 1600px, 100vw"}]},"width":1600,"height":828}}},"excerpt":"Nathan Tankus reveals seven secret books authored by a very important Federal Reserve general counsel that he unearthed through a Freedom of Information Act request","custom_excerpt":"Nathan Tankus reveals seven secret books authored by a very important Federal Reserve general counsel that he unearthed through a Freedom of Information Act request","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"06 February, 2024","published_at_pretty":"06 February, 2024","updated_at_pretty":"22 February, 2024","created_at":"2024-02-05T21:03:30.000-05:00","published_at":"2024-02-06T07:00:46.000-05:00","updated_at":"2024-02-21T22:58:55.000-05:00","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Notes on the Crises","slug":"crisesnotes","bio":null,"profile_image":null,"twitter":null,"facebook":null,"website":null}],"primary_author":{"name":"Notes on the Crises","slug":"crisesnotes","bio":null,"profile_image":null,"twitter":null,"facebook":null,"website":null},"primary_tag":{"name":"Federal Reserve","slug":"federal-reserve","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},"tags":[{"name":"Federal Reserve","slug":"federal-reserve","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"FOIA","slug":"foia","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"Monetary Policy","slug":"monetary-policy","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"}],"plaintext":"This is a Premium Piece of Notes on the Crises. Thank you for being a Paid Subscriber\n\nOver the past eight months, I’ve been increasingly focusing on Freedom of Information Act Requests of the Federal Reserve System. What attracted me to this kind of work is the realization of how much material is not publicly accessible — simply because there has not been very much interest in focusing Freedom of Information Act requests on the Federal Reserve. But I’m very interested.\n\n\n\nSince I think making this institution more well understood to the general public is important, unearthing material has both been illuminating in the short term as well as provided plenty for researchers to pick over in the future. I’m especially interested in questions around the Federal Reserve’s legal authority and legal analysis of the Federal Reserve. That’s a particular topic, which the few who have FOIAed the Fed in the past have been particularly interested in. That meant I knew I had questions that had not yet occurred to others.Nevertheless, it takes creativity to come up with requests that the Federal Reserve would actually fulfill (the question of suing the Fed is another matter!) One thing I’ve done to get inspiration for FOIA requests is look through the papers of former Federal Reserve officials at presidential libraries. Last October I was looking through the Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns papers. Those are kept at the Gerald Ford Presidential Library in Ann Arbor Michigan. What piqued my curiosity from those records was a set of “monographs” with enticing titles attributed to Howard Hackley. At that point, I sent a Freedom of Information Act Request to the Federal Reserve for all of them.\n\nThose of you who have been reading my recent output will know that I’ve been increasingly fixated on Howard Hackley. He was a longtime Federal Reserve lawyer who became General Counsel for the Federal Reserve Board, back in 1957. He stayed in that position until 1967, at which time he transitioned to an “assistant” to the Board. (He also served as legal counsel for the Federal Open Market Committee until his retirement in mid-1973.) In other words, he shepherded the Federal Reserve into the modern era. Far from a marginal figure, Hackley made many of the legal determinations that define the Fed as an institution today. Yet he hasn’t received anything like his due attention. When did he write these monographs? What did they say?\n\n\n\nI knew they were most likely authored near the time period of Burns’s tenure as Federal Reserve Chairman. This made them especially interesting to me. That’s because I suspected that they were authored during the middle period between Hackley’s time as the Federal Reserve Board’s head lawyer and his retirement. I’ve wondered about what he was doing with this time in the past. For context, the amount of legal work lawyers at the Federal Reserve Board have is greatly multiplied relative to the FOMC. Recall that the FOMC is responsible for monetary policy. That means the legal questions it deals with are relatively small, and few entities have standing to legally challenge the FOMC’s legal opinions. This is because it's difficult to prove that you are directly impacted by the technical changes to monetary policy created by new FOMC legal decisions.\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board, by contrast, has to deal with questions of financial regulation. These questions are both complex and involve the entire financial system, meaning many entities (with large legal budgets) can potentially challenge their legal determinations. More basically, the legal oversight (measured in agency memos, reports etc.) required to keep up with the entire banking industry is staggering. This legal work also greatly increased when the Federal Reserve was given responsibility to regulate Bank Holding Companies. That happened in 1956 (a topic for another day). All that to say: the General Counsel of the Federal Reserve Board has quite a lot of work. Stepping down from Federal Reserve Board general counsel to FOMC general counsel must have felt like taking on a leisurely and relaxing job for such an experienced Federal Reserve lawyer. \n\n\n\nThus, it intuitively made sense to me that he spent that time writing. I already knew about a publicly available and published book on the “Lending Functions of Federal Reserve Banks” published in May 1973. Nevertheless, I was blown away when the Federal Reserve fulfilled my request in mid-December and I found 1051 pdf pages staring back at me. Thus, by number of pages, this was my most successful FOIA by far. Without further ado, here are the seven books.\n\n\n\n\nHackley 1969. Recommendations for Changes in the Federal Reserve Act\n\nHackley 1969. Recommendations for Changes in the Federal Reserve Act, Appendix A – Proposed Draft Bill to Revise the Federal Act\n\nHackley 1969. Should the Stock of the Federal Reserve Banks Be Retired?\n\nHackley 1970. Should Requirements with Respect to the Selection of Reserve Bank Directors Be Changed?\n\nHackley 1970. Should the Composition of the Board of Governors be Changed?\n\nHackley 1970. The Federal Reserve Advisory Council\n\nHackley 1971. Should the Federal Open Market Committee Be Abolished or Changed?\n\nHackley 1972. The Status of the Federal Reserve System in the Federal Government\n\n\n\nTaken together, these monographs form commentary on all the most commonly discussed areas of reform regarding the Federal Reserve. Their titles straightforwardly reflect this. They are clearly the topics of reform that most commonly recurred up until that point of Federal Reserve history. For the most part, they remain the most commonly discussed topics of reform today. It is extremely useful to have Howard Hackley’s views on all of these topics assembled in this way. I would even go so far as to say that many of these reforms would likely have happened in the 1970s if Hackley’s views on these various subjects had been made public.\n\n\n\nIt’s far beyond the scope of this single piece to assess the contents of each of these monographs. However, I will make some suggestive comments. The monograph “Should the Stock of the Federal Reserve Banks Be Retired?” is extremely useful, since the false impression that Federal Reserve Banks are in any sense “private” remains to this day. The reality is that these banks are not under the control of bankers through ownership of this stock, and this book spells out why (at length). This paragraph from the monograph’s conclusion summarizes this well:\n\nOne can at least start the weighing process with two propositions generally accepted by both proponents and opponents of proposals to eliminate Reserve Bank stock. First, such stock does not give member banks any \"proprietary\" interest in the Reserve Banks or enable them to control the operations and policies of the Federal Reserve System. Second, the stock is not essential to the Reserve Banks from a financial point of view; whether it is desirable for other reasons is another question - the question at issue.\n\nAnother pair of documents that I think is worth highlighting is the “Recommendations for changes in the Federal Reserve Act”, and the “Appendix” containing the draft legislation being proposed. In particular, I want to focus on a particular statement that appears early on. The following quote from that section I think does a good job of capturing the Federal Reserve’s approach to legislation:\n\nThe extent to which terms used in the Federal Reserve Act should be defined in the statute presents a difficult question of judgment. It would be possible to attempt to define many words that frequently give rise to questions of interpretation, such as the words \"bank\", \"branch\", \"deposit\", and \"capital and surplus\". However, it is believed that, as a general rule, it is preferable to avoid precise statutory definitions of such terms. It is not only difficult to define terms of this kind but it is desirable to afford the flexibility provided by interpretative or regulatory definitions \n\n[...]\n\nFor the reasons indicated, it is believed that section 1 of the Federal Reserve Act should contain, with one exception hereafter noted, only \"descriptive\" or \"short-hand\" definitions that would facilitate drafting and reference. At the same time, it would be desirable to incorporate at some place in the Act - perhaps in the section relating to the Board of Governors - a provision giving the Board general authority to define terms used in the Act in order to effectuate the purposes and prevent evasions of the Act.\n\nOf course, there are valid reasons to think that strict statutory definitions can cause problems. The issue that tightly defining terms facilitates “evasions” of the law is well known. However, the flexibility granted in defining legislative terms also facilitates the Federal Reserve “evading” the legislative intent of congress itself. As I’ve argued in the past, the real trouble comes when the Federal Reserve is “flexible” in interpreting its own powers on behalf of some — while showing “rigidity” in interpretation on behalf of others. \n\n\n\nIn that respect, I was particularly entertained when I read through the proposed legislation, and realized that the Federal Reserve’s “emergency” lending authority was rewritten to be even more permissive than it is today. Specifically, Hackley proposes this updated language:\n\nAny Reserve Bank may make advances in exigent circumstances to any individual, partnership, or corporation, on its promissory notes, secured to the satisfaction of the Reserve Bank, subject to such limitations, restrictions, and regulations as the Board may prescribe.  [italics added]\n\nDid you catch it? Rather than saying “unusual and exigent circumstances”, this draft bill merely says “exigent circumstances”. I plan on returning to this topic when I look back on the legacy of the SVB bank failure. \n\n\n\nIn many ways the final book is the most interesting. “The Status of the Federal Reserve System in the Federal Government” effectively served as a book length account of the Federal Reserve legal counsel’s interpretation of why “Central Bank Independence” is desirable. His perspective is more unique and complex, no doubt related to being a detailed legal analysis of the relevant issues rather than a breezy economist oriented commentary on the same issues. Reviewing the book in its entirety is beyond my scope today. However, one important element of the book is its emphasis on the lack of annual appropriations as a foundational element of the Federal Reserve’s “independence”:\n\nOne of the most significant reasons for the System's independence has been the fact that, unlike most Government agencies, it has not been dependent upon Congressional appropriations. Under provisions of the original Federal Reserve Act that have never been changed, all expenses of the Board are defrayed from assessments on the Reserve Banks which, in turn, derive their earnings principally from purchases and sales of Government securities - earnings sufficient for the expenses of the Reserve Banks as well as those of the Board\n\nThe fact that the Federal Reserve System is not subject to congressional appropriations has been a point I’ve long hammered in this newsletter — so it's nice to see one of the Federal Reserve’s premiere lawyers emphasize it himself.This is no doubt not my last word on these 1000 or so pages. Indeed, I expect to be integrating them into my future work for a longtime to come. However, I’m most excited about what other people do with these texts. I strongly suspect the research and scholarship being conducted relating to central banking (and the Federal Reserve specifically) will greatly benefit from Howard Hackley’s voluminous analysis.\n\nPrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><em>This is a Premium Piece of Notes on the Crises. <strong>Thank you for being a Paid Subscriber</strong></em></p><p>Over the past eight months, I’ve been increasingly focusing on Freedom of Information Act Requests of the Federal Reserve System.

Their titles straightforwardly reflect this. They are clearly the topics of reform that most commonly recurred up until that point of Federal Reserve history. For the most part, they remain the most commonly discussed topics of reform today. It is extremely useful to have Howard Hackley’s views on all of these topics assembled in this way. I would even go so far as to say that many of these reforms would likely have happened in the 1970s if Hackley’s views on these various subjects had been made public.</p><p></p><p>It’s far beyond the scope of this single piece to assess the contents of each of these monographs. However, I will make some suggestive comments. The monograph “Should the Stock of the Federal Reserve Banks Be Retired?” is extremely useful, since the false impression that Federal Reserve Banks are in any sense “private” remains to this day. The reality is that these banks are not under the control of bankers through ownership of this stock, and this book spells out why (at length). This paragraph from the monograph’s conclusion summarizes this well:</p><blockquote>One can at least start the weighing process with two propositions generally accepted by both proponents and opponents of proposals to eliminate Reserve Bank stock. First, such stock does not give member banks any \"proprietary\" interest in the Reserve Banks or enable them to control the operations and policies of the Federal Reserve System. Second, the stock is not essential to the Reserve Banks from a financial point of view; whether it is desirable for other reasons is another question - the question at issue.</blockquote><p>Another pair of documents that I think is worth highlighting is the “Recommendations for changes in the Federal Reserve Act”, and the “Appendix” containing the draft legislation being proposed. In particular, I want to focus on a particular statement that appears early on. The following quote from that section I think does a good job of capturing the Federal Reserve’s approach to legislation:</p><blockquote>The extent to which terms used in the Federal Reserve Act should be defined in the statute presents a difficult question of judgment. It would be possible to attempt to define many words that frequently give rise to questions of interpretation, such as the words \"bank\", \"branch\", \"deposit\", and \"capital and surplus\". However, it is believed that, as a general rule, it is preferable to avoid precise statutory definitions of such terms. It is not only difficult to define terms of this kind but it is desirable to afford the flexibility provided by interpretative or regulatory definitions&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>[...]</blockquote><blockquote>For the reasons indicated, it is believed that section 1 of the Federal Reserve Act should contain, with one exception hereafter noted, only \"descriptive\" or \"short-hand\" definitions that would facilitate drafting and reference. At the same time, it would be desirable to incorporate at some place in the Act - perhaps in the section relating to the Board of Governors - a provision giving the Board general authority to define terms used in the Act in order to effectuate the purposes and prevent evasions of the Act.</blockquote><p>Of course, there are valid reasons to think that strict statutory definitions can cause problems. The issue that tightly defining terms facilitates “evasions” of the law is well known. However, the flexibility granted in defining legislative terms also facilitates the Federal Reserve “evading” the legislative intent of congress itself. As I’ve argued in the past, the real trouble comes when the Federal Reserve is “flexible” in interpreting its own powers on behalf of some — while showing “rigidity” in interpretation on behalf of others.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>In that respect, I was particularly entertained when I read through the proposed legislation, and realized that the Federal Reserve’s “emergency” lending authority was rewritten to be even more permissive than it is today. Specifically, Hackley proposes this updated language:</p><blockquote>Any Reserve Bank may make advances i<em>n exigent circumstances</em> to any individual, partnership, or corporation, on its promissory notes, secured to the satisfaction of the Reserve Bank, subject to such limitations, restrictions, and regulations as the Board may prescribe.&nbsp; [italics added]</blockquote><p>Did you catch it? Rather than saying “unusual and exigent circumstances”, this draft bill merely says “exigent circumstances”. I plan on returning to this topic when I look back on the legacy of the SVB bank failure.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>In many ways the final book is the most interesting. “The Status of the Federal Reserve System in the Federal Government” effectively served as a book length account of the Federal Reserve legal counsel’s interpretation of why “Central Bank Independence” is desirable. His perspective is more unique and complex, no doubt related to being a detailed legal analysis of the relevant issues rather than a breezy economist oriented commentary on the same issues. Reviewing the book in its entirety is beyond my scope today. However, one important element of the book is its emphasis on the lack of annual appropriations as a foundational element of the Federal Reserve’s “independence”:</p><blockquote>One of the most significant reasons for the System's independence has been the fact that, unlike most Government agencies, it has not been dependent upon Congressional appropriations. Under provisions of the original Federal Reserve Act that have never been changed, all expenses of the Board are defrayed from assessments on the Reserve Banks which, in turn, derive their earnings principally from purchases and sales of Government securities - earnings sufficient for the expenses of the Reserve Banks as well as those of the Board</blockquote><p>The fact that the Federal Reserve System is not subject to congressional appropriations has been a point I’ve long hammered in this newsletter — so it's nice to see one of the Federal Reserve’s premiere lawyers emphasize it himself.This is no doubt not my last word on these 1000 or so pages. Indeed, I expect to be integrating them into my future work for a longtime to come. However, I’m most excited about what <em>other people</em> do with these texts. I strongly suspect the research and scholarship being conducted relating to central banking (and the Federal Reserve specifically) will greatly benefit from Howard Hackley’s voluminous analysis.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QXIJ19idlvntRhnVb4cs9p9qRETocJgK/view?usp=sharing&ref=crisesnotes.com\" class=\"kg-btn

the Crises  Thank you for being a Paid Subscriber\n\nMy last piece for Notes On The Crises was a hit: I wrote about the treasury default memo, which I managed to get from the Federal Reserve through FOIA at the end of June. Besides being widely shared on social media, Toby Nagle of the Financial Times Alphaville blog wrote an entire piece on that memo (along with my commentary). In addition to Nagle’s extensive coverage, Matt Levine at Bloomberg, Oddlots at Bloomberg and Marketwatch all linked to the piece. Given all that, I realized that my followup piece should probably just cover the rest of my current FOIA successes. I have a tendency to want a piece to reflect all my thoughts on a subject, and offer up a grand vision of important macro topics.  I need regular reminders to… resist that tendency. Newsletters, after all, are dollops of information. \n\n\n\nSo let’s keep things straightforward: what else is currently in my FOIA vault?\n\n\n\nTo my mind all of these different stories fit into a much longer history of accounting gimmicks to avoid the debt ceiling. I have, in fact, had a piece on the “70 year” history of these accounting gimmicks in the works for quite some time. As I researched that piece, I recently discovered in Morgenthau’s diary (Treasury Secretary under president Roosevelt) that there was an extensive and comprehensive plan to use accounting gimmicks to avoid the debt ceiling from 1939 to 1940. That plan was cooked up by Federal Reserve Chairman Marriner Eccles, and then enthusiastically supported by Roosevelt. That means it's more like an 85 year history. (But that’s a story for another time…)Today’s topic is the history of the debt ceiling as we know it, which takes us back to the 1970s. The background context of this batch of FOIA discoveries originates in a little noticed episode at the beginning of the Nixon administration regarding the debt ceiling. The issue of the budget at this time was extremely sensitive because it was so profoundly tied up with the Vietnam War. And the War was already unpopular enough without that. President Johnson didn’t run for reelection because of Vietnam, while Richard Millhouse Nixon had pledged to “end the war” (even if he did not actually intend to…) That made any request to raise the debt ceiling a chance to relitigate the war spending already ongoing. Given that context, a lameduck president (Johnson) was not going to pick an unwinnable fight. And the president that succeeded him was not going to have a legislative solution ready within a week of inauguration.\n\n\n\nEnter the accounting gimmicks. The end of the Johnson administration saw a number of federal accounting tricks used, most notably an obscure one regarding the International Monetary Fund (as it’s pretty elaborate, I will cover it in a future piece). So we are decades deep into tricks and illusions like those I have discussed this year. The two memos I’ve secured relate to a more expansive list of accounting gimmicks, some of which require the Federal Reserve’s cooperation. You can expect a lot more from Notes on the Crises laying out how these gimmicks work in the new year. \n\n\n\nContinuing the tradition of anodyne memo names, the first memo dated January 30th 1969 was simply entitled \"Treasury Cash and Debt Ceiling Dilemma.\" by Alan Holmes. Holmes was the New York Federal Reserve’s Manager of the Fed’s “System Open Market Account” (SOMA). In other words, he decided what the Fed bought and sold. The second memo “Legal aspects of proposals for assisting Treasury in connection with cash and debt ceiling problems” was authored by head legal counsel Howard Hackley. (Long time readers of Notes on the Crises may recognize Hackley as the man who came up with the legal justification for central bank swap lines — with nothing but the text of the Federal Reserve Act and his creativity.)\n\n\n\nSkipping over the Treasury initiated gimmicks for the purposes of this piece, I’m going to focus on the three very interesting Federal Reserve-related proposals. The first proposal is “Immediate credit by Reserve Banks for Government deposits.”But what does that mean?This is more straightforward than it seems on the surface. If you’ve ever sent or received a bank payment (either electronically or by check), you know there is a time difference between when the bank received the payment (or the check) and the point the account was credited. Therefore, this LBJ Treasury proposal is for the Federal Reserve to immediately credit the Treasury’s bank account for checks and other funds deposited by the Treasury rather than having a delay for “processing”. I find this proposal so interesting because, as we’ll see in Hackley’s legal opinion below, it provides insights into larger debates over “what counts” as direct “borrowing” from the Federal Reserve by the Treasury:\n\n\n\nThe practice by which, under the present time schedules of the Reserve Banks, immediate credit or deferred credit up to two days is given for items received from member banks has itself always been subject to some legal question on the ground that the giving of such credit for items before they are finally collected amounts to an unauthorized extension of credit to member banks. this practice has been defended on the ground that any resulting credit to member banks is incidental to the efficient administration of the check collection functions of the Reserve Banks \n\n\n\nHowever, a departure from the practice that would result in immediate credit for all items deposited by the Government would appear clearly to constitute simply a means of extending credit to the Treasury rather than a proper incident to collection operations and would therefore, in my opinion, be even more subject to legal question. \n\n\n\nWe learn two interesting things from Hackley’s legal analysis here. First, the Federal Reserve’s check collection practices had long been subject to extensive internal legal debate that I was not previously aware of. This debate is based on the idea that by crediting the accounts of banks before checks had been fully processed, they were providing interest free loans that they weren’t demanding collateral for. The justification for this practice, that they aren’t “intending” to extend credit but instead its “incidential” to “efficient administration of the check collection functions”, has big implications for other practices that provide “incidential” benefits but are justified for other reasons.\n\n\n\nMost interesting however, is the discussion of the Treasury “borrowing” aspect. Recall that, at this time, the Federal Reserve could buy up to 5 billion dollars of treasury securities directly from the Treasury. The issue from the debt ceiling point of view is that if such “credit extensions” counted as a “direct purchase”, they would count against the debt ceiling. The trick is getting the Treasury’s account credited without any corresponding “debt subject to limit”. Alan Holmes memo informs us that “counsel at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has expressed the opinion that the Federal Reserve is not authorized to grant immediate credit to the Treasury while it denies such credit to other depositors”. The interesting implication of this statement is that if the Federal Reserve switched to immediate crediting of all checks, this would not be subject to the same legal objections. This leads to the obvious question: what other things could the Federal Reserve do that “incidentially” filled up the Treasury’s bank account without creating more debt “subject to limit”?\n\n\n\nThe next option discussed by the memos is labeled by Holmes as “Speed-up of payments to Treasury of interest on uncovered Federal Reserve notes”. I’m not going to get into the ins and outs of this antiquarian phrase of art except to say that it is referring to remittances of profits from the Federal Reserve to the Treasury. Today these payments are legally required by the 2015 FAST act. The idea with this option is simply that the faster these remittances fill up the Treasury’s bank account, the less treasuries they have to issue. Hackley finds this proposal so uncontroversial that he spends all of two sentences affirming its legality:\n\nPayments to the Treasury of interest on Federal Reserve notes at a rate fixed by the Board pursuant to section 16 of the Federal Reserve Act are now made on a monthly basis. I see no legal objection to a procedure under which such payments would be made on a weekly or even a daily basis\n\nThe wide discretion the Federal Reserve has over its own accounting rules creates many opportunities to fill up the Treasury’s account by reporting more profits (or less losses) at the Federal Reserve Bank level. \n\n\n\nHowever, the most legally questionable approach would be to talk in terms of “prepaying” remittances. This is a proposal economist JW Mason made in Barron’s this year. As we’ve seen above, “prepaying” remittances would most likely be interpreted similarly to providing immediate credit for government deposits. In other words, an extension of credit to the Treasury without statutory authorization and, even if authorized, producing a debt obligation that would count against the debt ceiling. That being said, even this provocative approach would have more legal grounding if some other purpose was proffered that made the higher flow of remittances an “incidental” outcome. This brings us to the final Federal Reserve related proposal. This suggestion is the most familiar gimmick to a wider audience of scholars. The “Warehousing of foreign currency assets” did actually happen in 1969 and again in 1994, as I briefly wrote about in the Financial Times blog. Thus, what is interesting about the discussion of this proposal in these memos is understanding the legal justifications Hackley provided in 1969 and the wider implication of his legal arguments. \n\n\n\nLet’s back up; what is “warehousing”? The Treasury has historically had primary responsibility for “intervening” in foreign exchange markets to affect the dollar’s exchange rate with foreign currencies. To do this there is an “Exchange Stabilization Fund” where the Treasury “holds” this foreign currency (The role of the ESF has greatly expanded beyond foreign currency operations since its inception). The issue is that the ESF is just a legal and accounting device (dare I say “gimmick”?) When the “ESF” buys foreign currencies, what operationally happens is that the Treasury sends out dollar payments from its bank account at the Federal Reserve. The Treasury fills this account by issuing treasuries- there’s that debt ceiling again.\n\n\n\nThe solution the Treasury suggested was to, as long as the treasury was near the debt ceiling, sell the foreign currency to the Federal Reserve with an implicit “promise” to buy the foreign currency back when the debt ceiling no longer binds. There are a few notable things about this. First, it is operationally identical to depositing a platinum coin with the Federal Reserve. So, to the extent you fear what would happen if the Treasury deposits a trillion dollar platinum coin with the Fed, “warehousing” tells you what would happen: not much of anything. This proposal is as much, arguably more, of an “accounting gimmick” than the platinum coin. The Federal Reserve has gone along with “warehousing” multiple times.\n\n\n\nThe other notable element of this proposal is the idea that the Treasury is informally promising to “buy back” the foreign currency at an unspecified later date. That’s kind of like a “credit extension” is it not? Indeed, Hackley comments on this issue at length in his memo:\n\nIt must be recognized that adoption of the proposed arrangement could subject the System to criticism. It might be charged, for example, that the proposed warehousing transactions would constitute a direct extension of credit to the Treasury by the Federal Reserve and would be contrary to the spirit if not the letter of the law, particularly in view of the express provisions contained in section 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act for direct borrowing by the Treasury from the Federal Reserve within prescribed statutory limits. However, for the reasons here indicated, I believe that the transactions would be legally defensible as not being designed primarily to aid the Treasury but as intended to avoid developments that would have an adverse impact upon the \"credit situation of the country.\"\n\nThis conclusion is, of course, foreshadowed by Hackley’s legal reasoning regarding the first proposal I discussed. It, in fact, goes further. Now the implicit “credit extension” is permissible not just as a byproduct of another policy goal, they can go further. They can specifically aim to fill up the Treasury’s account with some other statutorily authorized action if that is merely a means to the end of avoiding the negative impact of treasury default on the “credit situation of the country”. This is truly extraordinary and in some ways is stronger confirmation of my arguments this year than the 2011 memos.\n\n\n\nHackley reconfirms this in multiple places in the memo. He states that as long as the Federal Reserve has statutory authority to undertake an action (in this case buying foreign currency on the “open market), “the fact that their purpose may appear to be solely to provide the Treasury with additional cash does not affect their legality”. That is an extremely strong statement. He expounds on this point at length such that his view is unmistakable:\n\nSection 12A of the Act provides that open market purchases and sales \"shall be governed with a view to accommodating commerce and business and with regard to their bearing upon the general credit situation of the country.\" The proposed warehousing transactions might not be regarded, in the usual sense, as conforming with this requirement. However, Mr. Holmes' memorandum expresses the view that either a breach of the debt ceiling or failure of the Treasury to pay its bills \"could have financial repercussions, both at home and abroad, that might seriously impair the dollar,\" Moreover, circumstances might arise under which, in order to avoid these alternatives, the Treasury might be obliged to sell in the market large amounts of foreign currency holdings of the Stabilization Fund; and any such action could, of course, result in \"disorderly conditions in exchange markets\" within the meaning of the Foreign Currency Directive. Consequently, if the proposed warehousing transactions are designed to avoid any of these possibilities, they would clearly have a very vital \"bearing upon the general credit situation of the country.\"\n\n\n\nSince Section 12A of the Federal Reserve Act is still good law, it is clear that this interpretation is still valid. Furthermore, the 2011 memo (and FOMC transcript discussion of it) indicates that this legal interpretation has not changed, even if the Federal Reserve does not like the implications of its internal policy to become fully understood by the public- or congress for that matter. Holmes suggestion that “In the meantime the Treasury could be assured of the desire and willingness of the Federal Reserve to cooperate in meeting a national emergency if one, in fact, developed.” defines the Federal Reserve’s posture. It will do everything in its power to avoid treasury default, it defines its legal powers quite widely and it simply wants to keep these facts quiet.\n\n\n\nAs far as I can tell, this Hackley memo has only been previously cited by secondary literature authored or coauthored by Owen Humpage. Humpage is a former senior economist at the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank. Presumably, he got access to the memo thanks to being an employee of the Federal Reserve System. Additionally, he only focuses on one element of the memo: the discussion of the “warehousing” proposal and its supposed threat to “central bank independence”. Unlike me, he is not particularly interested in the wider question of the debt ceiling that the memo is actually focused on. As such, I believe this is the first published discussion of the entire contents of the Hackley memo and, as far as I can tell, the first public mention of Alan Holmes’ memo from the previous day.\n\n\n\nThese memos are far older than the 2011 memo I unveiled at the beginning of the month. Superficially, their contents are less explosive. However, I think my discussion here, and their text themselves, illustrate that they are similarly important in subtler ways. They show that the “financial stability” logic motivating preventing treasury default has a long history within the Federal Reserve’s internal legal reasoning. These memos also exemplify that given the Federal Reserve’s deep commitment to preventing treasury default, they prefer whenever possible to be seen as not making a choice. This is why, as I wrote about for much of the first half of the year, options which have the Treasury solely rely on the Federal Reserve as a fiscal agent are not just acceptable from the Federal Reserve’s point of view, they are preferred.\n\nPrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><em>This is a Premium Piece of Notes on the Crises &nbsp;<strong>Thank you for being a Paid Subscriber</strong></em></p><p>My last piece for <em>Notes On The Crises</em> was a hit: <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-got-the-fed-to-release-its-2011-treasury-default-playbook-heres-what-it-says-and-why-it-matters/\"><u>I wrote about the treasury default memo</u></a>, which I managed to get from the Federal Reserve through FOIA at the end of June.

Given all that, I realized that my followup piece should probably just cover the rest of my current FOIA successes. I have a tendency to want a piece to reflect all my thoughts on a subject, and offer up a grand vision of important macro topics.&nbsp; I need regular reminders to… resist that tendency. Newsletters, after all, are dollops of information.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>So let’s keep things straightforward: what else is currently in my FOIA vault?</p><!--members-only--><p></p><p>To my mind all of these different stories fit into a much longer history of accounting gimmicks to avoid the debt ceiling. I have, in fact, had a piece on the “70 year” history of these accounting gimmicks in the works for quite some time. As I researched that piece, I recently discovered in Morgenthau’s diary (Treasury Secretary under president Roosevelt) that there was an extensive and comprehensive plan to use accounting gimmicks to avoid the debt ceiling from 1939 to 1940. That plan was cooked up by Federal Reserve Chairman Marriner Eccles, and then enthusiastically supported by Roosevelt. That means it's <strong>more like an 85 year history.</strong> (But that’s a story for another time…)Today’s topic is the history of the debt ceiling as we know it, which takes us back to the 1970s. The background context of this batch of FOIA discoveries originates in a little noticed episode at the beginning of the Nixon administration regarding the debt ceiling. The issue of the budget at this time was extremely sensitive because it was so profoundly tied up with the Vietnam War. And the War was already unpopular enough without that. President Johnson didn’t run for reelection because of Vietnam, while Richard Millhouse Nixon had pledged to “end the war” (even if he did not actually intend to…) That made any request to raise the debt ceiling a chance to relitigate the war spending already ongoing. Given that context, a lameduck president (Johnson) was not going to pick an unwinnable fight. And the president that succeeded him was not going to have a legislative solution ready within a week of inauguration.</p><p></p><p><strong>Enter the accounting gimmicks. </strong>The end of the Johnson administration saw a number of federal accounting tricks used, most notably an obscure one regarding the International Monetary Fund (as it’s pretty elaborate, I will cover it in a future piece). So we are <strong>decades deep</strong> into tricks and illusions like those I have discussed this year. The two memos I’ve secured relate to a more expansive list of accounting gimmicks, some of which require the Federal Reserve’s cooperation. You can expect a lot more from <em>Notes on the Crises</em> laying out how these gimmicks work in the new year.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Continuing the tradition of anodyne memo names, the first memo dated January 30th 1969 was simply entitled <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC19690130Memo01.pdf\"><u>\"Treasury Cash and Debt Ceiling Dilemma.\"</u></a> by Alan Holmes. Holmes was the New York Federal Reserve’s Manager of the Fed’s “System Open Market Account” (SOMA). In other words, he decided what the Fed bought and sold. The second memo <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC19690131Memo02.pdf\"><u>“Legal aspects of proposals for assisting Treasury in connection with cash and debt ceiling problems”</u></a> was authored by head legal counsel Howard Hackley. (Long time readers of <em>Notes on the Crises</em> may recognize Hackley as the man <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/listen-fed-the-imf-needs-access-to/\"><u>who came up with the legal justification for central bank swap lines</u></a> — with nothing but the text of the Federal Reserve Act and his creativity.)</p><p></p><p>Skipping over the Treasury initiated gimmicks for the purposes of this piece, I’m going to focus on the three very interesting Federal Reserve-related proposals. The first proposal is “Immediate credit by Reserve Banks for Government deposits.”But what does that mean?This is more straightforward than it seems on the surface. If you’ve ever sent or received a bank payment (either electronically or by check), you know there is a time difference between when the bank received the payment (or the check) and the point the account was credited. Therefore, this LBJ Treasury proposal is for the Federal Reserve to immediately credit the Treasury’s bank account for checks and other funds deposited by the Treasury rather than having a delay for “processing”. I find this proposal so interesting because, as we’ll see in Hackley’s legal opinion below, it provides insights into larger debates over “what counts” as direct “borrowing” from the Federal Reserve by the Treasury:</p><p></p><blockquote>The practice by which, under the present time schedules of the Reserve Banks, immediate credit or deferred credit up to two days is given for items received from member banks has itself always been subject to some legal question on the ground that the giving of such credit for items before they are finally collected amounts to an unauthorized extension of credit to member banks. this practice has been defended on the ground that any resulting credit to member banks is incidental to the efficient administration of the check collection functions of the Reserve Banks&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>However, a departure from the practice that would result in immediate credit for all items deposited by the Government would appear clearly to constitute simply a means of extending credit to the Treasury rather than a proper incident to collection operations and would therefore, in my opinion, be even more subject to legal question.&nbsp;</blockquote><p></p><p>We learn two interesting things from Hackley’s legal analysis here. First, the Federal Reserve’s check collection practices had long been subject to extensive internal legal debate that I was not previously aware of. This debate is based on the idea that by crediting the accounts of banks before checks had been fully processed, they were providing interest free loans that they weren’t demanding collateral for. The justification for this practice, that they aren’t “intending” to extend credit but instead its “incidential” to “efficient administration of the check collection functions”, has big implications for other practices that provide “incidential” benefits but are justified for other reasons.</p><p></p><p>Most interesting however, is the discussion of the Treasury “borrowing” aspect. Recall that, at this time, the Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr684.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>could buy up to 5 billion dollars</u></a> of treasury securities directly from the Treasury. The issue from the debt ceiling point of view is that if such “credit extensions” counted as a “direct purchase”, they would count against the debt ceiling. The trick is getting the Treasury’s account credited without any corresponding “debt subject to limit”. Alan Holmes memo informs us that “counsel at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has expressed the opinion that the Federal Reserve is not authorized to grant immediate credit to the Treasury while it denies such credit to other depositors”. The interesting implication of this statement is that if the Federal Reserve switched to immediate crediting of <em>all checks</em>, this would not be subject to the same legal objections. This leads to the obvious question: what other things could the Federal Reserve do that “incidentially” filled up the Treasury’s bank account without creating more debt “subject to limit”?</p><p></p><p>The next option discussed by the memos is labeled by Holmes as “Speed-up of payments to Treasury of interest on uncovered Federal Reserve notes”. I’m not going to get into the ins and outs of this antiquarian phrase of art except to say that it is referring to remittances of profits from the Federal Reserve to the Treasury. Today these payments are legally required by the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ94/PLAW-114publ94.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>2015 FAST act</u></a>. The idea with this option is simply that the faster these remittances fill up the Treasury’s bank account, the less treasuries they have to issue. Hackley finds this proposal so uncontroversial that he spends all of two sentences affirming its legality:</p><blockquote>Payments to the Treasury of interest on Federal Reserve notes at a rate fixed by the Board pursuant to section 16 of the Federal Reserve Act are now made on a monthly basis. I see no legal objection to a procedure under which such payments would be made on a weekly or even a daily basis</blockquote><p>The wide discretion the Federal Reserve has over <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/macro-musings/nathan-tankus-public-finance-covid-19-crisis-consolidated-budget-balance-view-and-its?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>its own accounting rules</u></a> creates many opportunities to fill up the Treasury’s account by reporting more profits (or less losses) at the Federal Reserve Bank level.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>However, the most legally questionable approach would be to talk in terms of “prepaying” remittances. This is a proposal economist <a href=\"https://jwmason.org/slackwire/2023/05/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>JW Mason made in <em>Barron’s</em></u></a> this year. As we’ve seen above, “prepaying” remittances would most likely be interpreted similarly to providing immediate credit for government deposits. In other words, an extension of credit to the Treasury without statutory authorization and, even if authorized, producing a debt obligation that would count against the debt ceiling. That being said, even this provocative approach would have more legal grounding if some other purpose was proffered that made the higher flow of remittances an “incidental” outcome. This brings us to the final Federal Reserve related proposal. This suggestion is the most familiar gimmick to a wider audience of scholars. The “Warehousing of foreign currency assets” did actually happen in 1969 and again in 1994, as I briefly wrote about in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afb6ef8f-be7c-45ac-8a7d-56550b64fd9e?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><em><u>Financial Times blog</u></em></a><em>.</em> Thus, what is interesting about the discussion of this proposal in these memos is understanding the legal justifications Hackley provided in 1969 and the wider implication of his legal arguments.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Let’s back up; what is “warehousing”? The Treasury has historically had primary responsibility for “intervening” in foreign exchange markets to affect the dollar’s exchange rate with foreign currencies. To do this there is an “Exchange Stabilization Fund” where the Treasury “holds” this foreign currency (The role of the ESF has <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201221175039id_/https://ecgi.global/sites/default/files/working_papers/documents/menandfinal_0.pdf\"><u>greatly expanded beyond foreign currency operations</u></a> since its inception). The issue is that the ESF is just a legal and accounting device (dare I say “gimmick”?) When the “ESF” buys foreign currencies, what operationally happens is that the Treasury sends out dollar payments from its bank account at the Federal Reserve. The Treasury fills this account by issuing treasuries- there’s that debt ceiling again.</p><p></p><p>The solution the Treasury suggested was to, as long as the treasury was near the debt ceiling, sell the foreign currency to the Federal Reserve with an implicit “promise” to buy the foreign currency back when the debt ceiling no longer binds. There are a few notable things about this. First, it is operationally identical to depositing a platinum coin with the Federal Reserve. So, to the extent you fear what would happen if the Treasury deposits a trillion dollar platinum coin with the Fed, “warehousing” tells you what would happen: not much of anything. This proposal is as much, arguably more, of an “accounting gimmick” than the platinum coin. The Federal Reserve has gone along with “warehousing” multiple times.</p><p></p><p>The other notable element of this proposal is the idea that the Treasury is informally promising to “buy back” the foreign currency at an unspecified later date. That’s kind of like a “credit extension” is it not? Indeed, Hackley comments on this issue at length in his memo:</p><blockquote>It must be recognized that adoption of the proposed arrangement could subject the System to criticism. It might be charged, for example, that the proposed warehousing transactions would constitute a direct extension of credit to the Treasury by the Federal Reserve and would be contrary to the spirit if not the letter of the law, particularly in view of the express provisions contained in section 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act for direct borrowing by the Treasury from the Federal Reserve within prescribed statutory limits. However, for the reasons here indicated, I believe that the transactions would be legally defensible as not being designed primarily to aid the Treasury but as intended to avoid developments that would have an adverse impact upon the \"credit situation of the country.\"</blockquote><p>This conclusion is, of course, foreshadowed by Hackley’s legal reasoning regarding the first proposal I discussed. It, in fact, goes further. Now the implicit “credit extension” is permissible not just as a byproduct of another policy goal, they can go further. They can specifically aim to fill up the Treasury’s account with some other statutorily authorized action <strong>if</strong> that is merely a means to the end of avoiding the negative impact of treasury default on the “credit situation of the country”. This is truly extraordinary and in some ways is stronger confirmation of my arguments this year than the 2011 memos.</p><p></p><p>Hackley reconfirms this in multiple places in the memo. He states that as long as the Federal Reserve has statutory authority to undertake an action (in this case buying foreign currency on the “open market), “the fact that their purpose may appear to be solely to provide the Treasury with additional cash <strong>does not</strong> affect their legality”.

That piece, was entitled “Biden Can Steamroll Republicans on the Debt Ceiling”, and I aimed squarely at debunking the idea that the Federal Reserve would step on any “unilateral actions” to avoid treasury default. My key piece of evidence was a memo that I had not read, and was not publicly available. But I knew the contents of the memo indirectly through the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting transcripts. Those comments were in some ways especially revealing, since they came from the Fed’s three leaders: Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Jerome Powell. It’s worth quoting the key part of my Op Ed at length:\n\n\n\nOn that call, Powell and most of his colleagues reluctantly endorsed buying defaulted Treasury securities — an unprecedented move to maintain financial stability — if a legislative debt ceiling solution did not come in time. Here’s the key exchange between Powell and then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke (options “8 and 9” in the memo are purchases of defaulted Treasury securities and the Fed “swapping” non-defaulted Treasury securities for defaulted Treasury securities):\n\nMR. POWELL: As long as I’m talking, I find 8 and 9 to be loathsome. I hope that gets into the minutes. [Laughter] But I don’t want to say today what I would and wouldn’t do, if we have to actually deal with a catastrophe on this.\n\n\n\nCHAIRMAN BERNANKE: So you are willing to accept “loathsome” under some certain circumstances. [Laughter]\n\n\n\nMR. POWELL: Yes, under certain circumstances.\n\nPowell’s willingness to purchase defaulted Treasury securities — however “loathsome” he finds it — casts the entire debate over bypassing Congress on the debt ceiling in a new light. No option under discussion is more extreme, from the Federal Reserve’s point of view, than stepping in and buying compromised securities of uncertain underlying value.\n\nWhen I wrote and published this Op Ed, I was actually working on getting hold of that memo. Using the Federal Open Market Committee Freedom of Information Act official website portal, I had crafted a request for this memo, as well as some older unreleased materials. As an aside, make sure the website you are on is about the Federal Open Market Committee, if you decide to get into the FOMC Freedom of Information Act Request game yourself. There is a website for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. If you submit a request to that website when you’re seeking Federal Open Market Committee related material, your request will bounce and will be redirected to the FOMC FOIA website. I personally make sure to resubmit when I make this mistake in case something gets lost in the shuffle between FOIA portals. If you want to request materials related to the discount window and 13(3) “unusual and exigent circumstances” authority, the Board of Governors website is the one you want.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAnyway, I had not gotten a response at the time of publishing the OpEd — nor frankly did I expect to get one. I thought this material would be considered too sensitive and too recent to release. Happily, I can inform you that I was wrong. On June 30th of this year I received a copy of the memo. It was also quietly linked to in the “2011 memos” section of their website, meaning it has technically been publicly available since I received it. However, it does not show up on google searches (like many other memos do). As far as I can tell, no one has noticed that this memo is now public. Thus, I can confidently say that I am the first to bring the full text of this memo to the public, and analyze its specific contents. The memo is dryly entitled “Potential Policy Responses to the Debt Ceiling”.\n\nBefore getting to the policy options it lays out, it's worth commenting on how it elegantly summarizes “the problem”. The first sentence of the memo claims: “With the federal debt ceiling binding and the Treasury running out of the additional borrowing capacity it can achieve under various accounting procedures, a technical default on Treasury securities cannot be ruled out.”. That summary is notable for a few reasons. First, it recognizes that the problem is not “debt” or “deficits”, but rather the lack of legal authority to issue additional treasury securities. Second, as I’ve hammered many times in this newsletter (as well as the Financial Times and Politico among other outlets) the treasury always already uses accounting gimmicks to continue to fill up its checking account, and make payments. What does that mean?  That there is no debate about whether the treasury should use accounting gimmicks to circumvent the debt ceiling. It already does that. The real debate is over whether it should use an “accounting gimmick” to permanently and unilaterally avoid default.\n\nWith that out of the way, we move on to their policy options. Let’s start with the five basic options listed first. These are interesting because they were uncontroversial to members of the FOMC when they were discussed in 2011, and again in 2013. Therefore the extent to which these options themselves preserve liquidity for defaulted treasury securities, they emphasize the extent to which the Federal Reserve will strive to contain the economic and financial stability fallout from a treasury default.:\n\nWe begin by describing how defaults could affect five routine policy actions that are permissible under the Federal Reserve Act and fall within the current authorization of the Desk and the authority of the Reserve Banks. The relevant issue for these actions is the treatment of defaulted Treasury securities – that is, securities that are experiencing a delay in principal or interest payments due to the debt ceiling. The staff’s recommendation is to make no changes to our current procedures, thereby treating defaulted Treasury securities in these transactions on the same terms that apply to other (non-defaulted) Treasury securities. This approach would send a signal to the market that we continue to view principal and interest for these securities as backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Moreover, in many cases, this approach would help the market cope with the pressures that could emerge in such circumstances. \n\n\n\nIn other words, there are all sorts of day to day things that the Federal Reserve does that provide liquidity to treasury markets which the Federal Reserve would continue. But what are those options?\n\n1. Outright purchases of Treasury securities\n\n2. Rollovers of maturing Treasury securities.\n\n3. Securities lending activity.\n\n4. Repurchase agreements.\n\n5. Discount window lending.\n\nThese tools are very familiar to people who read about monetary policy. The main surprise here is regarding the first “option”. In inferring the contents of this memo from the FOMC transcript, I didn’t realize that the first option included the purchase of defaulted treasury securities. Yet, it does. As the document says: “Accordingly, unless otherwise directed by the Committee, the [New York Federal Reserve Trading] Desk intends to accept defaulted securities in these operations in the same manner as other Treasury securities, with the prices determined through competitive bidding.” This means that Federal Reserve officials have across the board found the purchase of defaulted treasury securities by The Fed to be uncontroversial. This is an important and remarkable fact.\n\n\n\nBut what of the other options? Option 2 is not really focused on the defaulted securities part of a potential debt ceiling crisis. Instead, it is concerned with how to deal with the Fed’s “reinvestment policy” when the treasury is no longer conductings new auctions. I will skip over that issue to focus on options 3 to 5. These options sound very different, but really they are all about borrowing from the Federal Reserve. They are really concerned with the question of “collateral” for those loans. In option 3, the Federal Reserve is lending securities rather than “cash”. Nevertheless, it wants collateral. The repurchase agreements of option 4 are simply a form of borrowing that has preferential treatment in bankruptcy. Since the collateralized loan is structured like a repurchase agreement, if the borrower fails to “repurchase” the collateral, then the lender gets to keep it. Option 5 is simply the discount window, the most traditional version of Federal Reserve lending.\n\n\n\nSo what is the Federal Reserve’s concern? In all these cases, they are thinking through how to treat defaulted treasury securities. An obvious approach would be to not accept defaulted treasury securities as collateral. The justification would be… they’ve defaulted. A subtler option is accepting them as collateral, but at their current (depressed) market price, or at some other lower price. The issue with these approaches is that they worsen liquidity for these securities — while causing panic about what might happen to currently undefaulted treasury securities. The Memo’s alternative is to accept them at the same terms they accept undefaulted treasury securities. \n\n\n\nWhile this is a more technical issue than outright purchases of defaulted treasury securities, it is not less important. As we saw earlier this year with the Bank Term Funding Program, changing the collateral policy to treasury securities can have a profound impact. There is no doubt that if the Federal Reserve, for lending purposes, treated defaulted treasury securities like undefaulted securities it would go quite a long way to preserving liquidity for these instruments, and thus the larger treasury market. It is thus notable that Federal Reserve officials treated these options (which are simply three manifestations of the same policy) as uncontroversial \n\n\n\nThe next three options are about technical issues related to the repo market, as well as Money Market Mutual Funds. I may write about this section of the memo in a premium piece in the future. But for today I’m keeping my focus on the issue of defaulted treasury securities. It is worth saying though, that this part of the memo illustrates the Federal Reserve’s commitment to preventing a treasury default from having a wider knock-on impact on financial markets. In any case, the remaining part of the memo deals with engaging in purchase and sale operations specifically aimed at absorbing defaulted treasury securities. Now that we have the memo in hand, it's clearer that purchasing defaulted treasury securities was not controversial. Instead, it was specifically aiming at, and designing a comprehensive program to solve, the issue of defaulted treasury securities which made Federal Reserve officials uncomfortable. However, the transcript conversations show far more willingness to use these options if circumstances truly required them than staffers expected. For completeness sake, I will quote this part of the memo below:\n\n9. Purchase operations to remove defaulted Treasury securities from the market. To limit the negative impact of defaulted securities on market functioning, the FOMC could decide to purchase a specified amount of these issues from market participants. These purchases would be in addition to those associated with reinvestments (the first policy issue described above). This approach would help market functioning if cash market liquidity were to deteriorate and participants were otherwise unable to sell their Treasury holdings. Moreover, in contrast to the financing operations discussed above, outright purchases remove the securities from firms’ balance sheets, so that the firms no longer have to deal with the operational issues associated with defaulted securities. Unless offset by other actions, such operations would increase the size of the SOMA portfolio and the amount of reserves in the banking system. \n\n\n\n10. Outright CUSIP swaps to remove defaulted Treasury securities from the market. One way to avoid the effects of additional purchase operations on the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the amount of reserves is to do them as CUSIP swaps. A CUSIP swap would be an operation in which the Desk simultaneously (or at least on the same day) bought a defaulted Treasury security and sold a non-defaulted Treasury security. This operation would be roughly neutral in terms of the size of the SOMA portfolio and the amount of reserves in the banking system. It could also be designed to limit any change in the duration risk of the SOMA. This approach has similarities to securities lending operations against defaulted Treasury collateral (the third policy issue described above), only in this case the operation would remove the defaulted securities from the market permanently. The terms of these operations would be determined through competitive bidding\n\n\n\nNow that we know the Federal Reserve’s playbook in case of a treasury default, we can be much more confident in the future when arguing during the next debt ceiling crisis. Powell, or any future Federal Reserve chair, may deny that this playbook has any implications for how they would respond to unilateral workarounds of the debt ceiling. However, now any reader can plainly see that that isn’t true. They are willing to do an incredible amount — if it's necessary to contain the financial instability resulting from a treasury default. They would gladly facilitate an option the Treasury pursues in its role as fiscal agent, since they can always claim that it was the Treasury’s decision and they had no other option as fiscal agent (which happens to be true). To deny the Treasury and then step into the breach themselves with a policy that is clearly their own to follow, or not follow, puts them in a far more untenable political position. I’m glad to have this out there, and I look forward to unearthing many more gems through Freedom of Information Act requests in the coming months and years.\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version","html":"<div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Readers may recall that I wrote a Politico Op Ed at a critical moment in the debt ceiling showdown. That piece, was entitled <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/19/powell-debt-ceiling-fed-00092522?ref=crisesnotes.com\">“Biden Can Steamroll Republicans on the Debt Ceiling”</a>, and I aimed squarely at debunking the idea that the Federal Reserve would step on any “unilateral actions” to avoid treasury default. My key piece of evidence was a memo that I had not read, and was not publicly available. But I knew the contents of the memo indirectly through the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting transcripts. Those comments were in some ways especially revealing, since they came from the Fed’s three leaders: Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Jerome Powell. It’s worth quoting the key part of <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/19/powell-debt-ceiling-fed-00092522?ref=crisesnotes.com\">my Op Ed</a> at length:</p><p></p><blockquote>On that call, Powell and most of his colleagues reluctantly endorsed buying defaulted Treasury securities — an unprecedented move to maintain financial stability —<strong> </strong>if a legislative debt ceiling solution did not come in time. Here’s the key exchange between Powell and then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke (options “8 and 9” in the memo are purchases of defaulted Treasury securities and the Fed “swapping” non-defaulted Treasury securities for defaulted Treasury securities):</blockquote><blockquote class=\"kg-blockquote-alt\"><strong>MR. POWELL: </strong>As long as I’m talking, I find 8 and 9 to be loathsome. I hope that gets into the minutes. [Laughter] But I don’t want to say today what I would and wouldn’t do, if we have to actually deal with a catastrophe on this.</blockquote><blockquote class=\"kg-blockquote-alt\"></blockquote><blockquote class=\"kg-blockquote-alt\"><strong>CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: </strong>So you are willing to accept “loathsome” under some certain circumstances. [Laughter]</blockquote><blockquote class=\"kg-blockquote-alt\"></blockquote><blockquote class=\"kg-blockquote-alt\"><strong>MR. POWELL: </strong>Yes, under certain circumstances.</blockquote><blockquote>Powell’s willingness to purchase defaulted Treasury securities — however “loathsome” he finds it — casts the entire debate over bypassing Congress on the debt ceiling in a new light. No option under discussion is more extreme, from the Federal Reserve’s point of view, than stepping in and buying compromised securities of uncertain underlying value.</blockquote><p>When I wrote and published this Op Ed, I was actually working on getting hold of that memo. Using the Federal Open Market Committee Freedom of Information Act <a href=\"https://fomcfoia.federalreserve.gov/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">official website portal</a>, I had crafted a request for this memo, as well as some older unreleased materials. As an aside, make sure the website you are on is about the Federal Open Market Committee, if you decide to get into the FOMC Freedom of Information Act Request game yourself. There is a website for the <a href=\"https://foia.federalreserve.gov/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve</a>. If you submit a request to that website when you’re seeking Federal Open Market Committee related material, your request will bounce and will be redirected to the FOMC FOIA website. I personally make sure to resubmit when I make this mistake in case something gets lost in the shuffle between FOIA portals. If you want to request materials related to the discount window and 13(3) “unusual and exigent circumstances” authority, the Board of Governors website is the one you want.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Anyway, I had not gotten a response at the time of publishing the OpEd — nor frankly did I expect to get one. I thought this material would be considered too sensitive and too recent to release. Happily, I can inform you that I was wrong. On June 30th of this year I received a copy of the memo. It was also quietly linked to in the “2011 memos” section of their website, meaning it has technically been publicly available since I received it. However, it does not show up on google searches (like many other memos do). As far as I can tell, no one has noticed that this memo is now public. Thus, I can confidently say that I am the first to bring the full text of this memo to the public, and analyze its specific contents. The memo is dryly entitled <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20110719memo01.pdf\">“Potential Policy Responses to the Debt Ceiling”</a>. </p><p>Before getting to the policy options it lays out, it's worth commenting on how it elegantly summarizes “the problem”. The first sentence of the memo claims: “With the federal debt ceiling binding and the Treasury running out of the additional borrowing capacity it can achieve under various accounting procedures, a technical default on Treasury securities cannot be ruled out.”. That summary is notable for a few reasons. First, it recognizes that the problem is not “debt” or “deficits”, but rather the lack of legal authority to issue additional treasury securities. Second, as I’ve hammered many times in this newsletter (as well as the Financial Times and Politico among other outlets) the treasury always already uses accounting gimmicks to continue to fill up its checking account, and make payments.

Silicon Valley Bank and the incoherence of the Federal Reserve's (lack of) an interest rate policy this week.” The central premise of this piece was that a lack of forward guidance was creating uncertainty in the treasury market as participants were unclear whether the Fed would be hiking because of inflation, holding because of financial stability or even outright cutting interest rates. This uncertainty in turn, I argued back then, was causing treasury market issues. I argued it was those issues that led to a breakdown of liquidity similar to 2020 and so called “repo madness” in September 2019. There is nothing logically wrong with its central argument. The problem with my old argument is simply that it's empirically false.\n\n\nNo one has publicly criticized this piece, or said that it was in error. However, I’ve heard through backchannels that I was wrong. A fortunate part of my success over the last three and a half years is that I have all sorts of contacts among people on Wall Street, in government or involved with public policy in general. These contacts are people who I can run things by, and who talk to me periodically. Sometimes it's because they are sympathetic with my political inclinations, while a surprising number are simply interested in my analysis. They talk to me because they’re attracted to conversing with people who want to “get it right”. I have the great privilege now of being able to draw from, or hear from, these people periodically. That input is most valuable when I get things wrong, as I did in that piece.\n\n\nThe contacts I talked to thought that the impact of a lack of forward guidance I was pointing to was potentially plausible, but in practice they don’t think it's something financial market participants would think in terms of. This is interesting in itself: because if the Fed can’t even get treasury dealers to think about the impact of its lacking forward guidance, what hope is there of businesses or households doing so? Anyway, that’s a conversation for another time. So what did happen? The best guess from the people I talked to was a combination of two things:\n\n\n 1. The role of high frequency trading desks and hedge funds\n\nand\n\n 1. Government securities dealers attempting to preserve balance sheet space for the bank holdings of treasuries they expected to be sold.\n    \n\n\nLet’s take these in turn.\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\nHigh Frequency Traders and Hedge Funds\n\n\nThe role of high frequency traders and hedge funds in 2020’s liquidity freeze has gotten a lot of attention. Much has especially been made of the increasing role of hedge funds. I haven’t historically focused on this topic because I’ve felt that it missed the more fundamental issues. The key is that before the international financial regulatory agreement Basel III, dealer balance sheets could expand to an unlimited extent in order to absorb “risk free” treasury securities. I wrote about this multiple times in 2020. Hedge funds, or high frequency traders, backing out of these markets during periods of instability didn’t seem to me to be particularly surprising. Nor did I think limiting the extent their balance sheets could expand to absorb treasuries would improve liquidity, even if it did make these institutions “safer”.\n\nI don’t think any of those conclusions are wrong, but I’ve become convinced over the past six months that it is interesting in and of itself that these actors have stepped into the breach. Some have become referring to them as “shadow dealers”. A recent interesting paper on this comes from Columbia Law professor Lev Menand and New York Fed Senior Policy Advisor Josh Younger. They focus on the history and current state of the treasury market, with a special focus on repo financing of treasury holdings. Following a lot of the alternative monetary analysis of the last 15 years, they treat repo liabilities as a form of money. That means they come to the conclusion that the U.S. has never stopped “money financing” treasury holdings.\n\n\nWhat changed after the Fed-Treasury Accord of 1951 was instead the type of money that financed their holdings and which institutions began holding them (and emitting money liabilities). In short, we went from central banks and banks purchasing and holding treasuries by issuing settlement balances or emitting bank deposits to dealers emitting repo liabilities. The paper, “Money and the Public Debt: Treasury Market Liquidity as a Legal Phenomenon”, is well worth a read (and not just because it positively cites me multiple times, including making the argument the paper makes in 2020).\n\n\nSo what does this have to do with today’s topic? In reading this paper I have become convinced that I have underrated the role of these high frequency trading desks and hedge funds. The core issue is one of monetary design, but these institutions reflect that lack of monetary design. Rather than being sideshows, their behavior in recent years reflects the opportunity to partially take the place left behind by more rigid balance sheets of dealers, who remained part of bank holding companies. At the same time, since “shadow” dealers are further outside the reach of the “regulatory perimeter”, they don’t have the same obligations as licensed dealers. They don’t have to regularly participate in treasury markets, and provision liquidity. Nor do they have access to the backstops that licensed government securities dealers have.\n\n\nThese HFT desks and hedge funds run from treasury markets at the first sign of trouble, and that’s precisely what they did after SVB failed. On the other hand, I was not wrong in 2019 or 2020 to think that regulating these entities more wouldn’t solve the fundamental problem. Making their balance sheets more rigid will just drain liquidity from treasury markets further, which would need to be offset one way or another. One way is the discount window, and the other way is to increase treasury purchases by the Federal Reserve. As we discussed in the UK context last year, they wouldn’t be “QE”. They would be “market functioning” purchases which were done regularly before the laxity of balance sheets under Basel II made them far less necessary. Meanwhile, bringing them into the regulatory perimeter but allowing them to keep their balance sheet flexibility would be a strange choice. If you are going to do that, why not simply provide more flexibility to existing dealers?\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nBalance Sheet Space For Licensed Dealers\n\n\nWhich brings me to the second reason I’ve heard back from wall street and other contacts: the licensed dealers. This is far more straightforward than the first reason. Following their expectation that banks were going to dump a lot of treasury holdings in an attempt to meet anticipated runs, dealers expanded the distance between their bid prices (the prices they are willing to purchase at) and their ask prices (the prices they are willing to sell at). This is known as their spreads, “dealer spreads” or straightforwardly “bid-ask spreads”. Since spreads are a critical way that participants and observers judge the state of liquidity, this by definition goes a significant way to explaining the treasury market dysfunction.\n\nThe other interesting thing about this point is that it means one part of my analysis in that March 16th post was half right. I thought the Bank Term Funding Program (the 13(3) facility the Fed launched) would keep banks from selling treasury securities. I was right about that. What I was wrong about was the balance of its liquidity impact. Writing feverishly and in a rush, I didn’t spend enough time thinking about whether chartered banks were significant dealers in government securities on the “sell side”. If they aren’t (and they aren’t), then keeping them holding treasury securities doesn’t impede the typical circulation of treasuries.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I didn’t realize that dealers were increasing spreads on the expectation of big selloffs and BTFP, by making selloffs less likely and more gradual, would lead them to shrink their spreads again — and improve overall liquidity. Credit where credit was due, they responded appropriately to the situation on a technical level even if the disturbing political economy issues remain and the monetary design issues are completely unresolved. I still think forward guidance should have been provided when SVB failed. But “no harm, no foul” as they say since it didn’t impact treasury market liquidity because treasury dealers, both licensed and “shadow”, don’t pay any attention.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nIt may seem strange, but being wrong in this way made this piece quite engaging and exciting to write. Being wrong can be a painful or embarrassing experience — but sometimes it's quite an enlightening and thought provoking one. This case is certainly an example of that for me. I also think writing about when I’m wrong helps readers understand the debates I’m engaged in, better than my opinion on its own. Revisiting and reassessing something I wrote in the midst of a crisis is also enlightening , so I think I will also be revisiting some of my writing from spring 2020 over the rest of the year.\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>On March 16th 2023, the Thursday after Silicon Valley Bank Failed, I <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/whats-going-on-with-treasuries-silicon-valley-bank-and-the-incoherence-of-the-federal-reserves-lack-of-an-interest-rate-policy-this-week/\">published a piece</a> entitled “What's going on with Treasuries? Silicon Valley Bank and the incoherence of the Federal Reserve's (lack of) an interest rate policy this week.” The central premise of this piece was that a lack of forward guidance was creating uncertainty in the treasury market as participants were unclear whether the Fed would be hiking because of inflation, holding because of financial stability or even outright cutting interest rates. This uncertainty in turn, I argued back then, was causing treasury market issues. I argued it was those issues that led to a breakdown of liquidity similar to 2020 and so called “repo madness” in September 2019. There is nothing logically wrong with its central argument. The problem with my old argument is simply that <strong>it's empirically false.</strong><br></p><p>No one has publicly criticized this piece, or said that it was in error. However, I’ve heard through backchannels that I was wrong. A fortunate part of my success over the last three and a half years is that I have all sorts of contacts among people on Wall Street, in government or involved with public policy in general. These contacts are people who I can run things by, and who talk to me periodically. Sometimes it's because they are sympathetic with my political inclinations, while a surprising number are simply interested in my analysis. They talk to me because they’re attracted to conversing with people who want to “get it right”. I have the great privilege now of being able to draw from, or hear from, these people periodically. <strong>That input is most valuable when I get things wrong, as I did in that piece.</strong><br></p><p>The contacts I talked to thought that the impact of a lack of forward guidance I was pointing to was potentially plausible, but in practice they don’t think it's something financial market participants would think in terms of. This is interesting in itself: because if the Fed can’t even get treasury dealers to think about the impact of its lacking forward guidance, what hope is there of businesses or households doing so? Anyway, that’s a conversation for another time. So what did happen? The best guess from the people I talked to was a combination of two things: <br></p><ol><li>The role of high frequency trading desks and hedge funds</li></ol><p>and</p><ol><li>Government securities dealers attempting to preserve balance sheet space for the bank holdings of treasuries they expected to be sold. <br></li></ol><h3 id=\"let%E2%80%99s-take-these-in-turn\">Let’s take these in turn.</h3><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><h2 id=\"high-frequency-traders-and-hedge-funds\"><br>High Frequency Traders and Hedge Funds<br></h2><p>The role of high frequency traders and hedge funds in 2020’s liquidity freeze <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/enhancing-liquidity-of-the-u-s-treasury-market-under-stress/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">has gotten a lot of attention</a>. Much has especially been made of the increasing role of hedge funds. I haven’t historically focused on this topic because I’ve felt that it missed the more fundamental issues. The key is that before the international financial regulatory agreement Basel III, dealer balance sheets could expand to an unlimited extent in order to absorb “risk free” treasury securities. I wrote about this <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\">multiple times</a> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/looking-back-at-repo-madness-one/\">in 2020</a>. Hedge funds, or high frequency traders, backing out of these markets during periods of instability didn’t seem to me to be particularly surprising. Nor did I think limiting the extent their balance sheets could expand to absorb treasuries would improve liquidity, even if it did make these institutions “safer”.<br><br>I don’t think any of those conclusions are wrong, but I’ve become convinced over the past six months that it is interesting in and of itself that these actors have stepped into the breach. Some have become referring to them as “shadow dealers”. A recent interesting paper on this comes from Columbia Law professor Lev Menand and New York Fed Senior Policy Advisor Josh Younger. They focus on the history and current state of the treasury market, with a special focus on repo financing of treasury holdings. Following a lot of the alternative monetary analysis of the last 15 years, they treat repo liabilities as a form of money. That means they come to the conclusion that the U.S. has never stopped “money financing” treasury holdings. <br></p><p>What changed after the Fed-Treasury Accord of 1951 was instead the type of money that financed their holdings and which institutions began holding them (and emitting money liabilities). In short, we went from central banks and banks purchasing and holding treasuries by issuing settlement balances or emitting bank deposits to dealers emitting repo liabilities. The paper, <a href=\"https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/CBLR/article/view/11900/6018?ref=crisesnotes.com\">“Money and the Public Debt: Treasury Market Liquidity as a Legal Phenomenon”</a>, is well worth a read (and not just because it positively cites me multiple times, including making the argument the paper makes in 2020).<br></p><p>So what does this have to do with today’s topic?

More than three years ago now I published written remarks of a talk I gave to a Federal Credit Union which laid out my (brief) articulation of some of MMT’s core ideas, and how those insights related to the then-raging Coronavirus Depression. Nevertheless, I tend not to write about MMT explicitly for Notes on the Crises. Nor have I written about theoretical debates among non-mainstream economists more generally in this newsletter. I have usually sought out other publications to do that kind of writing.  \n\n\nHowever, I am now under contract with Viking Press to write my book on the Federal Reserve Picking Losers. As a result, readers can expect some more writing on these sorts of disagreements in this newsletter. Furthermore, having reflected on doing this kind of writing, I’ve come to the conclusion that readers will get more out of it than I’ve sometimes thought in the past.\n\n\nOne of my most popular pieces in 2020 was my explanation of the Kalecki-Levy profits equation and the logic behind it. People read me to get a different perspective and the best way to learn about other perspectives is to watch debates between people who disagree in good faith. You can’t learn all you have to know about from reading people express their opinions in the abstract. Dispute is key for clarification. Many of these debates also have much wider relevance than their theoretical terms might suggest.\n\nWhich brings me to the topic of today’s piece. Readers are aware by now that there is a big debate over the extent to which price increases over the past three years are driven by “profits”. I find myself being a strange sort of “moderate” in this debate. As I wrote about in July 2022, following the Kalecki-Levy profits equation, I don’t think a rise in measured profits by definition tells us that there are target profit margin driven price increases going on. To quickly remind readers, target profit margins are the expected (or “planned”) profits from selling a specific product for a specific price. These “expected” profit margins may not be realized — that is, actual profit margins can diverge from target profit margins for various reasons. Those reasons can explain why overall profits rise. A rise in measured profits “after the fact” does not ipso facto mean an increase in target profit margins at the product level nor that higher profit margins were specifically associated with price increases. What is often called “average profit margins” are in reality actual or “realized” profits. Those are divided by the total revenue from sales over an entire company, industry or even all nonfinancial corporations.\n\n\nOn the other hand, by that same metric, I also don’t think that a rise in aggregate profit explicable in macroeconomic terms definitionally rules out a relevant role for target profit margin driven price increases. That is an unsatisfying answer for all concerned, I know! But I simply do not think we have enough evidence to know what proportion of price increases (or price index growth) are explained by administrative decisions to raise target profit margins (and thus prices.) We certainly do not know in real time what proportion is driven by these various factors.\n\n\n\n(By happenstance, I am about to run a workshop on the Kalecki Profits Equation and “Greedflation” in Poznan, Poland tomorrow.)\n\n\nThis past May another contribution to the debate over profits and covid inflation was provided by Post-Keynesian economist Marc Lavoie in a straightforwardly titled piece “Some controversies in the causes of the post-pandemic inflation”. Marc Lavoie is a very important figure in Post-Keynesian economics, having written the most read and utilized guide to Post-Keynesian economics, and co-writing the best known macroeconomic modeling textbook. His work is profoundly important in a variety of different ways and his modeling work alongside the late Wynne Godley takes the principle provided by the Kalecki-Levy Profits equation — to always make sure your economic narratives are accounting consistent — to new heights. This type of modeling, going under the phrase Stock Flow Consistent Modeling — is essential. This modeling approach seeks to carefully trace where financial (and physical) flows come from and go to in order to eliminate any possible “black holes” in the model. Check out. For example, this paper on modeling “open economies” in an accounting consistent manner. The point is that when professor Lavoie writes, a lot of people rightfully pay attention.\n\n\nHaving paid attention however, I find Lavoie’s piece puzzling. The true crux of his argument seems to be summed up in this quote:\n\n[T]he rise in profits and the profit share can be explained without resorting to an explanation based on firms taking advantage of the situation and raising markup rates. In other words, this third explanation denies the generalized existence of profit inflation.\n\nIn other words, because we can provide a plausible explanation of higher profits without target profit margin driven price increases, we should. Why we should act this way is left unexplained. As I’ve written about previously, there are certain reasons to doubt parts of the “profit inflation” story. But the ultimate determining factor should be qualitative and quantitative empirical evidence —not our beliefs about what theoretical stories we should (or should not) “resort to”.\n\n\nIt’s also unclear what role the phrase “generalized” is playing in: “generalized existence of profits inflation”. Since the story he is contending with is a story about firm pricing decisions, the question of how “generalized” target profit margin driven price increases are is a sideshow. For the purposes of our argument, generalization is neither here nor there. All that matters is how significantly it contributes to CPI growth and particular sectors can drive the behavior of the whole index (as I’ve commented on in the past.) Most significantly, rental housing clearly sees profit driven, rather than cost driven, price increases. As a result, rising rents have been a very large part of “covid inflation”. Indeed, shelter price index growth “explains” (in an accounting decomposition sense) the continued elevated growth in CPI, a return to the pre-pandemic pattern.\n\n\n\nNow in fairness to Marc Lavoie, his piece makes other arguments as well. So what is the nature of these other arguments? The first main one is his own microeconomic argument:\n\nFirst, consider the microeconomics of the firm. In the post-Keynesian tradition, firms usually operate in an area where marginal costs, or unit direct costs, are constant. Taking into account overhead labour costs and other fixed costs, unit costs are thus decreasing up to full capacity. This means that with a given markup rate over unit direct costs (or with a given markup rate over normal unit costs), profits will be rising for two reasons, as can be seen with the figure below, taken from my 2022 book. First, as firms produce and sell more units, their unit cost drops, and hence their realized profit per unit gets bigger, and secondly since they sell more units, they will make more profits.\n\nThis is in essence a more detailed version of my argument in years past that rising sales from government deficit spending can increase profits without changes in prices (or some other expenditure which is not a current cost to businesses.) Direct costs are those costs directly involved in making a product. The insertion of the word “unit” (i.e. “unit direct costs” or “unit costs”) here simply means “average”. The “mark up” on average total costs is simply the profit margin, expressed as a percentage. The “mark up” on average direct costs is a “contribution margin” which is supposed to cover both overhead costs and “profit”. Putting this all together; in the first part he is saying that as sales rise, ceteris paribus, average direct costs remain the same. If overhead costs also remain the same, realized profits will be higher “even though” the mark up he is referring to stays the same. I will return to that point in a moment.\n\n\nFor completeness sake, he also tries to articulate what happens to average total costs. This is despite the fact that his piece is very focused on the “contribution margin”, and average direct costs (a point we will return to.) He says that as sales rise (again ceteris paribus), average total costs fall. Remember that the denominator of the formula to determine average costs is sales, or equivalently, output. This fall in average costs because of rising sales leads profits to rise. However, there’s a problem. He says that the percentage mark up (the profit margin in this case) stays the same. But how could this be so?\n\n\nIf the price is staying the same and average total costs are declining, profit margins must be rising in percentage terms as well as absolute terms. He could rationalize this by saying that “while the ‘realized’ profit margin is higher, companies expect sales growth to reverse and thus they are keeping their ‘budgeted’ profit margins and outputs the same”. Hence his reference to “normal unit costs”. To be clear, what this means is that despite actual sales rising, he is holding normal or budgeted sales constant. I actually brought up this possibility in 2022.\n\n\nThe problem is that this carries us far away from the simple vignette he is trying to paint when applied over time, rather than at one point in time. If sales stay high and businesses keep on realizing higher percentage profit margins, the question arises; why are their budgeted average total costs remaining constant? What is driving their decision not to have “normal”/”budgeted” sales follow the trend of actual sales? Doing this for a year in a highly volatile pandemic environment is one thing. But over multiple years, we need an analytical explanation that Lavoie does not provide. He also does not direct readers to the role of time in his example pricing model. Also note that this rationalization of his piece’s argument involves businesses having sustained discretion over their “budgeted” sales. This is a form of discretion over pricing procedures that his entire piece is devoted to treating as irrelevant. This can’t ultimately bring coherence to Lavoie’s argument.\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nMore straightforwardly, I think that his simplified “Kaleckian pricing model” just does not illustrate what he set out to illustrate. The “mark up” over average direct costs may not be rising — but that’s irrelevant to the topic under discussion. Since the topic is “profits inflation” and not “contribution margin inflation”, what he has actually articulated is a pricing example where a firm (or multitude of firms) are raising target percentage profit margins over time, using their discretionary power to administer prices. The actual accounting data of the U.S. economy he discusses at the beginning of the piece is of average profit margins, and not average “contribution margins”. In similar terms, it’s the Kalecki-Levy Profits equation, not the Kalecki-Levy Contribution equation.\n\n\nThe other problem with Lavoie’s logic here is that his example does not simply assume away “profits inflation” —  it also assumes away price increases all together! Prices are constant, while average total costs fall. This leads to the aforementioned rising profit margins (and subsequent rising target profit margin.) Assuming everything else remains constant may be useful for “comparative statics”, or illustrative purposes; But given all the discussion of rising costs during the pandemic, cost increases must be introduced. At that point, the ceteris paribus assumption must be dropped. Once you do that, with the same assumptions about the impact of rising sales on average costs (they go down) and the same assumption of a rising target profit margin he has probably unconsciously made, what happens? You get both “inflation” and ballooning percentage profit margins.\n\n\nAverage total costs could remain constant instead of decline, because other costs rose as sales rose. This thwarts the decline that happens when the only change in costs is the greater “marginal” cost associated with producing more output. This would be a “pure” example of a target profit margin driven price increase. In the other case, average total costs could even rise (meaning total cost increases outpaced sales increases.) That would mean price increases would be both cost and profits based. His pricing example therefore put in a more relevant context, illustrates target profit margin driven price increases. This is quite a significant error. It's a mistake that also illustrates the danger with overreliance on a diagram about what could happen at a point in time when we’re discussing an issue that also involves dynamic changes through time.\n\n\nTo be generous to Lavoie’s approach here, he clearly thinks contribution margins i.e. the relation to direct costs is the important variable economists should focus on. It is genuinely interesting that the “mark up” on direct costs could be constant, even on a percentage basis, but percentage profit margins could still rise. But this is irrelevant to the specific topic at hand unless it could be shown that the overhead cost accounting information was irrelevant to pricing. That would mean that it could be shown that pricing decisions are only made relative to direct costs (meaning business enterprises are only “unconsciously” increasing realizing higher percentage profit margins), that they never become aware of (Or at least, become aware of too far along after the pricing decision to be of relevance.) However, there’s no evidence that this is true. In fact, ironically enough, an internal debate among Post-Keynesian economists three decades ago that Lavoie participated in was focused on precisely this issue.\n\n\nThe late UMKC economist Fred Lee criticized Lavoie and others for using pricing models that didn’t involve the measurement and allocation of overhead costs to specific products, since the evidence shows that businesses, especially large businesses, had already been doing that for decades by that point (at least.) Lavoie and others won the debate on the argument that such differences had no practical importance in economic modeling. The substantive point Lee was making has not only been acknowledged, it makes an appearance in Lavoie’s own textbook:\n\nWhereas, earlier, accountants had only very rough estimates of unit overhead costs, including depreciation costs, this has not been the case for quite a long time. Most firms, large ones in particular, have accurate estimates of unit overhead costs, having found means to attribute to each branch or product the overhead shop and factory costs incurred.\n\nThat makes it extremely ironic that Lavoie has written a piece whose analytical premise is centrally grounded in faulty logic regarding average direct costs, average total costs, contribution margins and profit margins. The importance of this issue can’t be underestimated. Simply put: it’s fatal to the argument of professor Lavoie’s piece.\n\n\nEither he is arbitrarily holding an ever widening gap between “normal” average costs and recently “realized” average costs, or he has constructed the very scenario he was trying to rule out with his toy model. To remind readers: an ever widening gap between constant normal/budgeted average total costs and falling actual average total costs has an equivalent and opposite impact on profit margins. In other words, by accounting definition, if the price is the same and average total costs are falling as a result of sales, this is leading to ever rising actual profit margins. Lavoie utterly convinced himself that average total cost pricing is not significantly different from average direct cost pricing. That means that he could not see that restating his argument in “normal unit cost” terms was no mere formality.\n\n\nMuch of the rest of the piece is devoted to explaining the behavior of something Lavoie calls the “share of profits in value added”. I’ve debated back and forth whether I should tackle this part of the piece at length. Having checked through his textbook and the source his textbook in turn cites, it's unclear why this concept matters. In financial accounting the difference between revenue and costs is the “value added”. At the firm or economy wide level, this is equivalent to total profits. In Lavoie’s long exegesis, he claims that rising “material costs” (raw material inputs and intermediate inputs) will lead to a higher “share of profits in value added” without a percentage change in markups. This may or may not be true…But it does not seem to have any relevance to the conversation about aggregate profits and pricing that the rest of us are having. It's also important to note that this variable is misleadingly named, since the “profits” mentioned are actually the “contribution to profit”, and not “strictly” profits. That’s because its the contribution margin, multiplied by average direct costs — and not the profit margin multiplied by average total costs.\n\n\nStill, at first glance, this section seems to have some remaining interest to the previous section —  since it acknowledges cost increases. However, when you examine things more closely, this conclusion is based on a very strange procedure involving arbitrarily including “average direct labor costs” in the calculation of this bespoke “profits share” measure. This is in addition to its role as part of direct costs multiplied by the contribution margin. I will leave it to interested readers to judge whether the textbook explanation of this variable makes sense. Average material costs may lead to higher prices and higher profits, true. But without knowing the other variables we can’t judge the hypothetical. No one else cares about a value added concept that for some reason includes direct labor costs as well. In fact, as far as I can tell, this “share of profits in value added” can fall as percentage profit margins rise as long as direct labor costs grow relative to the profit mark up. This holds true even if we substitute in Lavoie’s preferred direct cost mark up, leading to the “contribution to profit share” (rather than profit share.) In short, there is far less here than meets the eye. I feel bad even running readers through this conceptual dead end.\n\n\nTo sum up, simply because there are plausible ways to explain rising profits without target profit margins increasing, doesn’t mean that we should. It is an empirical question that needs further study. Lavoie does not provide evidence on actual pricing decisions to judge the role of profits. Likewise, the question of how potentially “generalized” increasing target profit margins might be is not directly relevant to the question at hand. Specific sectors can explain (or not explain) high CPI or PCE growth, and that should be the main criteria. Lavoie also has a strange and unique definition of “profit share” which leads down a road to nowhere. Most critically, Lavoie’s stylized example shows the opposite of what he sets out to show: an overreliance on comparative statics leads to a lack of thinking through what his claims about costing and pricing would mean over time (i.e. a series of pricing periods.) I hope this long read was an educational ride for readers. I will certainly be reflecting more on the Kalecki-Levy Profits equation — and especially its role in the ongoing so-called “greedflation” debate — in the future!\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version\n\n\n\n","html":"<div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Long time and close readers of <em>Notes on the Crises</em> will be aware that I’m a Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) scholar. More than three years ago now I published written remarks of a talk I gave to a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-gave-a-talk-to-a-federal-credit/\">Federal Credit Union</a> which laid out my (brief) articulation of some of MMT’s core ideas, and how those insights related to the then-raging Coronavirus Depression. Nevertheless, I tend not to write about MMT explicitly for <em>Notes on the Crises</em>. Nor have I written about theoretical debates among non-mainstream economists more generally in this newsletter. I have usually sought out other publications to do that kind of writing.  <br></p><p>However, I am now under contract with <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/book-announcement-picking-losers-also-i-was-in-politico-last-week/\">Viking Press to write my book on the Federal Reserve <em>Picking Losers</em></a><em>.</em> As a result, readers can expect some more writing on these sorts of disagreements in this newsletter. Furthermore, having reflected on doing this kind of writing, I’ve come to the conclusion that readers will get more out of it than I’ve sometimes thought in the past.<br></p><p>One of my most popular pieces in 2020 was my explanation of the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/where-do-profits-come-from/\">Kalecki-Levy profits equation</a> and the logic behind it. People read me to get a <strong>different</strong> perspective and the best way to learn about other perspectives is to watch debates between people who disagree in good faith.<strong> You can’t learn all you have to know about from reading people express their opinions in the abstract. </strong>Dispute is key for clarification. Many of these debates also have much wider relevance than their theoretical terms might suggest.<br><br>Which brings me to the topic of today’s piece. Readers are aware by now that there is a big debate over the extent to which price increases over the past three years are driven by “profits”. I find myself being a strange sort of “moderate” in this debate. As I wrote about in <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/prices-prices-prices-almost-everything-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-too-annoyed-to-ask/\">July 2022</a>, following the Kalecki-Levy profits equation, I don’t think a rise in measured profits by definition tells us that there are target profit margin driven price increases going on. To quickly remind readers, target profit margins are the expected (or “planned”) profits from selling a specific product for a specific price. These “expected” profit margins may not be <em>realized</em> — that is, actual<strong> profit margins can diverge from target profit margins for various reasons.</strong> Those reasons can explain why overall profits rise. A rise in measured profits “after the fact” does not <em>ipso facto</em> mean an increase in target profit margins at the product level nor that higher profit margins were specifically associated with price increases. What is often called “average profit margins” are<strong> in reality actual or “realized” profits.</strong> Those are divided by the total revenue from sales over an entire company, industry or even all nonfinancial corporations.<br></p><p>On the other hand, by that same metric, I also don’t think that a rise in aggregate profit explicable in macroeconomic terms <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20230503.pdf\">definitionally rules out</a> a relevant role for target profit margin driven price increases. That is <strong>an unsatisfying answer for all concerned,</strong> I know! But I simply do not think we have enough evidence to know what proportion of price increases (or price index growth) are explained by administrative decisions to raise target profit margins (and thus prices.) We certainly <strong>do not know in real time what proportion is driven by these various factors</strong>. </p><p></p><p>(By happenstance, I am about to run a workshop on the Kalecki Profits Equation and “Greedflation” in Poznan, Poland <a href=\"https://fundacjalipinskiego.pl/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mmt_summer-school_call-for-application_2023_02.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">tomorrow</a>.)<br></p><p>This past May another contribution to the debate over profits and covid inflation was provided by Post-Keynesian economist Marc Lavoie in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@monetarypolicyinstitute/some-controversies-in-the-causes-of-the-post-pandemic-inflation-1480a7a08eb7?ref=crisesnotes.com\">straightforwardly titled piece</a> “Some controversies in the causes of the post-pandemic inflation”. Marc Lavoie is a very important figure in Post-Keynesian economics, having written the <a href=\"https://www.elgaronline.com/monobook/book/9781839109621/9781839109621.xml?ref=crisesnotes.com\">most read and utilized guide to Post-Keynesian economics</a>, and co-writing<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-137-08599-3?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> the best known macroeconomic</a> modeling textbook. His work is profoundly important in a variety of different ways and his modeling work alongside the late Wynne Godley takes the principle provided by the Kalecki-Levy Profits equation — to always make sure your economic narratives are accounting consistent — to new heights. This type of modeling, going under the phrase Stock Flow Consistent Modeling — is essential. This modeling approach seeks to carefully trace where financial (and physical) flows come from and go to in order to eliminate any possible “black holes” in the model. Check out. For example, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23601836?ref=crisesnotes.com\">this paper</a> on modeling “open economies” in an accounting consistent manner. The point is that <strong>when professor Lavoie writes, a lot of people rightfully pay attention.</strong><br></p><p>Having paid attention however, I find Lavoie’s piece puzzling. The true crux of his argument seems to be summed up in this quote:</p><blockquote>[T]he rise in profits and the profit share can be explained without resorting to an explanation based on firms taking advantage of the situation and raising markup rates. In other words, this third explanation denies the generalized existence of profit inflation.</blockquote><p>In other words, because we <em>can</em> provide a plausible explanation of higher profits without target profit margin driven price increases, we <em>should.</em> Why we should act this way is left unexplained. As I’ve written about previously, there are certain reasons to doubt parts of the “profit inflation” story. But the ultimate determining factor should be qualitative and quantitative empirical evidence —not our beliefs about what theoretical stories we should (or should not) “resort to”. <br></p><p>It’s also unclear what role the phrase “generalized” is playing in: “generalized existence of profits inflation”. Since the story he is contending with is a story about firm pricing decisions, the question of how “generalized” target profit margin driven price increases are is a sideshow. For the purposes of our argument, generalization is <strong>neither here nor there.</strong> All that matters is how significantly it contributes to CPI growth and particular sectors can drive the behavior of the whole index (as I’ve <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/prices-prices-prices-almost-everything-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-too-annoyed-to-ask/\">commented on</a> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/dont-let-dick-cheney-ruin-price-regulation-too/\">in the past</a>.) Most significantly, rental housing clearly sees profit driven, rather than cost driven, price increases. As a result, rising rents have been a very large part of “covid inflation”. Indeed, shelter price index growth “explains” (in an accounting decomposition sense) the continued elevated growth in CPI, a return to the pre-pandemic pattern.<br><br></p><p>Now in fairness to Marc Lavoie, his piece makes other arguments as well. So what is the nature of these other arguments? The first main one is his own microeconomic argument:</p><blockquote>First, consider the microeconomics of the firm. In the post-Keynesian tradition, firms usually operate in an area where marginal costs, or unit direct costs, are constant. Taking into account overhead labour costs and other fixed costs, unit costs are thus decreasing up to full capacity. This means that with a given markup rate over unit direct costs (or with a given markup rate over normal unit costs), profits will be rising for two reasons, as can be seen with the figure below, taken from my 2022 book. First, as firms produce and sell more units, their unit cost drops, and hence their realized profit per unit gets bigger, and secondly since they sell more units, they will make more profits.</blockquote><p>This is in essence a more detailed version of my argument <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/where-do-profits-come-from/\">in years</a> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/prices-prices-prices-almost-everything-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-too-annoyed-to-ask/\">past</a> that rising sales from government deficit spending can increase profits without changes in prices (or some other expenditure which is not a current cost to businesses.) Direct costs are those costs directly involved in making a product. The insertion of the word “unit” (i.e. “unit direct costs” or “unit costs”) here simply means “average”. The “mark up” on average total costs is simply the profit margin, expressed as a percentage. The “mark up” on average direct costs is a “contribution margin” which is supposed to cover both overhead costs and “profit”. Putting this all together; in the first part he is saying that as sales rise, <em>ceteris paribus,</em> average direct costs remain the same. If overhead costs also remain the same, realized profits will be higher “even though” the mark up he is referring to stays the same. I will return to that point in a moment.<br></p><p>For completeness sake, he also tries to articulate what happens to average total costs. This is despite the fact that his piece is very focused on the “contribution margin”, and average direct costs (a point we will return to.) He says that as sales rise (again <em>ceteris paribus</em>), average total costs fall. Remember that <strong>the denominator of the formula to determine average costs is sales, or equivalently, output. </strong>This fall in average costs because of rising sales leads profits to rise. However, there’s a problem. He says that the percentage mark up (the profit margin in this case) stays the same. But how could this be so? <br></p><p>If the price is staying the same and average total costs are declining, profit margins must be rising in percentage terms as well as absolute terms. He could rationalize this by saying that “while the ‘realized’ profit margin is higher, companies expect sales growth to reverse and thus they are keeping their ‘budgeted’ profit margins and outputs the same”. Hence his reference to “normal unit costs”. To be clear, what this means is that despite <em>actual</em> sales rising, he is holding <em>normal</em> or <em>budgeted</em> sales constant. I actually brought up this possibility <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/prices-prices-prices-almost-everything-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-too-annoyed-to-ask/\">in 2022</a>. <br></p><p>The problem is that this carries us far away from the simple vignette he is trying to paint when applied <em>over time,</em> rather than at one point in time. If sales stay high and businesses keep on realizing higher percentage profit margins, the question arises; why are their budgeted average total costs remaining constant? What is driving their decision not to have “normal”/”budgeted” sales follow the trend of actual sales? Doing this for a year in a highly volatile pandemic environment is one thing. But over multiple years, we need an <em>analytical </em>explanation that Lavoie does not provide. He also does not direct readers to the role of time in his example pricing model. Also note that this rationalization of his piece’s argument involves businesses having sustained discretion over their “budgeted” sales. This is a form of discretion over pricing procedures that his entire piece is devoted to treating as irrelevant. This<strong> can’t ultimately bring coherence to Lavoie’s argument.</strong><br></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>More straightforwardly, I think that his simplified “Kaleckian pricing model” just does not illustrate what he set out to illustrate. The “mark up” over average direct costs may not be rising — but that’s irrelevant to the topic under discussion. Since the topic is “profits inflation” and not “contribution margin inflation”, what he has actually articulated is a pricing example where a firm (or multitude of firms) are raising target percentage profit margins over time, using their discretionary power to administer prices. The actual accounting data of the U.S. economy he discusses at the beginning of the piece is of average profit margins, and <strong>not average “contribution margins”.</strong> In similar terms, it’s the Kalecki-Levy <em>Profits</em> equation, not the Kalecki-Levy <em>Contribution</em> equation.<br></p><p>The other problem with Lavoie’s logic here is that his example does not simply assume away “profits inflation” —  it also assumes away price increases all together! Prices are constant, while average total costs fall. This leads to the aforementioned rising profit margins (and subsequent rising target profit margin.) Assuming everything else remains constant may be useful for “comparative statics”, or illustrative purposes; But given all the discussion of rising costs during the pandemic, cost increases must be introduced. At that point, the <em>ceteris paribus</em> assumption must be dropped. Once you do that, with the same assumptions about the impact of rising sales on average costs (they go down) and the same assumption of a rising target profit margin he has probably unconsciously made, what happens? You get<strong> both “inflation” and ballooning percentage profit margins. </strong><br></p><p>Average total costs could remain constant instead of decline, because other costs rose as sales rose. This thwarts the decline that happens when the only change in costs is the greater “marginal” cost associated with producing more output. This would be a “pure” example of a target profit margin driven price increase. In the other case, average total costs could even <em>rise </em>(meaning total cost increases outpaced sales increases.) That would mean price increases would be <em>both</em> cost <em>and</em> profits based. His pricing example therefore put in a more relevant context, <em>illustrates</em> target profit margin driven price increases. This is quite a significant error. It's a mistake that also illustrates the danger with overreliance on a diagram about what <em>could</em> happen at a point in time when we’re discussing an issue that also involves dynamic changes <em>through time</em>.<br></p><p>To be generous to Lavoie’s approach here, he clearly thinks contribution margins i.e. the relation to <em>direct costs</em> is the important variable economists should focus on. It is genuinely interesting that the “mark up” on direct costs could be constant, even on a <em>percentage </em>basis, but percentage <em>profit</em> margins could still rise. But this is irrelevant to the specific topic at hand unless it could be shown that the overhead cost accounting information was irrelevant to pricing. That would mean that it could be shown that pricing decisions are only made relative to direct costs (meaning business enterprises are only “unconsciously” increasing realizing higher percentage profit margins), that they never become aware of (Or at least, become aware of too far along after the pricing decision to be of relevance.) However, there’s no evidence that this is true. In fact, ironically enough, an internal debate among Post-Keynesian economists three decades ago that Lavoie participated in was focused on <em>precisely</em> this issue. <br></p><p>The late UMKC economist Fred Lee <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09538259400000041?ref=crisesnotes.com\">criticized Lavoie and others</a> for using pricing models that didn’t involve the measurement and allocation of overhead costs to specific products, since the evidence shows that businesses, <em>especially</em> <em>large businesses, </em>had already been doing that for decades by that point (at least.)

In that time, intellectual fault lines have solidified. At first dazed, the centrist banking scholars have rallied. In their view many things need fixing. Banking supervision, banking regulation, credit rating agencies, auditors and irresponsible creditors all need fixing. The one thing that does not need fixing: deposit insurance. As the panic has subsided from our mini-panic, the old attacks on deposit insurance have come to the forefront. The age-old claim that deposit insurance “punishes” sound banks (through greater insurance charges) and uniquely encourages irresponsible risk taking have returned with a vengeance. The latest missive comes from the Brookings Institution’s Aaron Klein. Klein's latest, published in the Wall Street Journal, is a piece entitled: “Why FDR Limited FDIC Coverage: The objective was to protect depositors, not rich people and big companies”\n\n\nThe core claim of the piece is that full deposit insurance subverts some sort of original intent of federal deposit insurance circa 1933:\n\nFederal deposit insurance was aimed at protecting the savings of the poor and middle class while leaving the rich to manage the risks of their large deposits. Extending it to large corporations and the wealthy would harm working people.\n\nWhen President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Banking Act of 1933, it capped coverage at $2,500. The current cap of $250,000 covers about 98% of Americans.\n\nThose who read me regularly will know full well I am on record strongly disagreeing with Aaron Klein’s perspective. It is no secret that I’m an advocate of full deposit insurance and put basically no stock in the “market discipline” supposedly provided by deposit insurance. However, my disagreement with Klein is not what motivated me to write a response to it. Instead, what bothered me was the misrepresentation of this crucial piece of economic and legal history.\n\n\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt was not some principled and long time advocate of partial deposit insurance. Instead, he was a total opponent of deposit insurance who, in the middle of a political fight where new banking legislation was urgently needed, accepted a limited form of deposit insurance. Even more importantly, the proposal on the table was for full deposit insurance and was subsequently negotiated down to partial deposit insurance in congress. Then even still it was FDR’s opposition to partial deposit insurance which held up legislation at a critical time for months.\n\n\nNow, in fairness to Mr. Klein, I was primed by the headline which begins “Why FDR Limited FDIC Coverage”. Most of the time Op Ed writers do not pick their own headlines so he isn’t responsible for the framing the reader first encounters. Nevertheless, I think his description above also lends itself to the false impression that the system we inherited is a product of considered design… rather than completely opposing visions which were compromised in the end. Before explaining Roosevelt’s place in this story, I think it's worth taking a step back and explaining the congressional context.\n\n\nThe key to understanding how we ended up with capped deposit insurance is to understand a completely forgotten aspect of the Banking Act of 1933. Specifically we have to consider the four provisions known as the “Glass-Steagall Act”. Today the names Carter Glass and Henry Steagall are extremely closely associated. It is barely remembered that there was any difference between them at all. However, the political import of the Glass-Steagall provisions is precisely that they were generated by two important figures who had opposing views on banking reform. Glass, well known for shepherding the 1913 Federal Reserve Act through the house, was a fierce opponent of deposit insurance and focused instead on limiting the investment activities of chartered banks (Glass often referred to those investments as “gambling”).\n\n\nIn contrast, Henry Steagall had been proposing deposit insurance for years. Even more importantly, he was proposing a full deposit guarantee. A CQ Research report from 1932 is worth quoting at length on this point:\n\nOther proposals offered during the present session range all the way from self-insurance of deposits by national banks and bond-surety systems to an outright guarantee by the federal government of the full amount of all deposits in all state and national banks. The bill that will receive most attention is that offered by Chairman Steagall, now pending before the House Banking and Currency Committee.\n\n\nThe Steagall bill would create a “Federal Bank Liquidating Board” to liquidate failed member banks of the Federal reserve system and administer the guaranty fund it proposes. The board would be allowed 30 days for an appraisal of the assets of an insolvent bank. A first payment to depositors would be required 60 days after the failure. This first payment would be not less than 50 per cent of all individual deposits under $1,000, On other deposits 25 per cent would be paid, except where 25 per cent amounted to less than 8500, in which case $500 would be paid.\n\n\nSix months later the board would be required to pay the remaining 50 per cent due on deposits of less than $1.000 and an additional 25 per cent on other deposits. Depositors not paid in full would receive an additional 25 percent 14 months after the failure. Six months later the board would pay all depositors in full and take whatever assets might remain. These assets would be disposed of for the benefit of the guaranty fund.\n\n\nUnder this system depositors with claims of less than $1,000 would be paid in full at the end of a maximum period of eight months, and all other depositors would be paid in full at the expiration of a maximum period of 20 months.\n\n\nThus, the only significant difference between small and large depositors in this scheme is the speed at which they would be made whole. Given that Steagall of Glass-Steagall fame was proposing full deposit insurance, the claim that capped deposit insurance was the wise and well thought out ideal emerging from the “New Deal” looks far more suspect. Which brings us to Roosevelt.\n\nSubscribe\n\nRoosevelt’s role at this time is even more obscure than the divisions between Senator Glass and House Representative Steagall. He was not simply totally opposed to deposit insurance, he held up banking reform for months because of his opposition. As the bevy of headlines in the header image illustrate, banking reform was not simply held up over the issue of deposit insurance: it was specifically held up over Roosevelt’s general opposition. Long after Glass and Steagall had compromised over a partial deposit insurance scheme, Roosevelt was still holding up the process. President Roosevelt’s “off the record” comment to a reporter at a March 8th 1933 press conference probably reflects both his personal and his political opinion at the time:\n\n\nAny form of general guarantee means a definite loss to the Government. The objective in the plan that we are working on can be best stated this way: There are undoubtedly some banks that are not going to pay one hundred cents on the dollar. We all know it is better to have that loss taken than to jeopardize the credit of the United States Government or to put the United States Government further in debt. Therefore, the one objective is going to be to keep the loss in the individual banks down to a minimum, endeavoring to get 100 percent on them. We do not wish to make the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future.\n\nIn this and other comments opposing deposit insurance, Roosevelt reflected the near unanimous views of bankers, especially branch banks (a topic I will return to later). By this I do not mean he was in the pocket of bankers, but simply that his aristocratic opinion reflected their elite opinion. His comments seem genuine to me. The importance of this is that when Klein invokes FDR’s views he is, knowingly or unknowingly, reflecting banker arguments against deposit insurance in general. He is certainly invoking Roosevelt’s arguments against any kind of deposit insurance. If we find those arguments against deposit insurance wanting, then it is more unclear why we should suddenly find them valid in the case of partial deposit insurance.\n\n\nThis brings us to the question of why Roosevelt changed his mind, and why an otherwise lockstep congress so vigorously disagreed with an extremely popular president. The answer, it turns out, is that deposit guarantees were far more popular among ordinary people than FDR in 1933. As historian Christopher Shaw illustrates in his article “‘The Man in the Street Is for It’: The Road to the FDIC”, the public overwhelmingly supported deposit guarantees and they made sure Congress knew it. Nor is there much evidence that these outcries hoped for capped deposit insurance in order to burden the richest or preserve “market discipline”. Democratic senator Robinson from Arkansas, an opponent of deposit guarantees, nonetheless acknowledged that: \"the people of this country are very much in sympathy with that idea and they believe that if the Federal Government would guarantee the deposits in all the banks, conditions would be very greatly improved and that prosperity would be promoted.\" In the same Philadelphia Inquirer article Senator Glass says that 95% of the telegrams congress is receiving are in support of deposit insurance.\n\n\nOrdinary people, then untrained in the immortal science of means testing, commonsensically concluded that if they thought deposit insurance was important for social stability and economic prosperity, that all deposits should be guaranteed. Furthermore, these people did not take an individual perspective in proposing deposit insurance as a populist economic reform. They saw deposit insurance as not just a means for their own personal consumer protection, but also a protection of their community. Specifically, the protection of small local banks, and the knock on effects of their failures. They saw clearly that deposit insurance limits would mean that the biggest, most well connected banks would benefit at the expense of small banks.\n\nSubscribe\n\nIn fact, the concentration of the banking system was Senator Glass’s key alternative to deposit insurance. He saw small banks as the achilles heel of the banking system, and wanted to expand branch banking. For context, the United States had historically had many restrictions on banks having multiple branches, motivated by fear of the concentration of banking. In the 1920s, as both “unit banks” (single location banks) and branch banks grew, there were a number of restrictions on and outright banning of branch banking at the state level. Glass’s theory was that with branch banking there would be a larger diversification of risk, and less exposure to the economic fortunes of depositors in a particular area.\n\n\nIt’s not hard to see how, in the context of depression conditions, the proliferation of branch banking could create a self-fulfilling cycle of perceived protection from risk and deposit flight to large banks. In fact, people understood this at the time. Tennessee representative Will Taylor outright said that “If deposits in all banks were guaranteed . . . money deposited in small cities, towns, and rural sections would be just as safe as money deposited in the large banks of the metropolitan center.” There is nothing new about these debates whatsoever. The two differences between them and us is they were far more familiar with the history of monetary reform debates than we are.  And we now have ninety additional years of history and evidence to draw upon that they did not.\n\n\nIt’s also important to remember where we began. Five weeks ago, there was a bank run at a significantly sized banking institution. This bank run is having knock on effects, even though those particular uninsured deposits were covered. Ordinary people ninety years ago had been suffering under years of bank runs and failures. They understand intuitively and viscerally that the burden of bank runs were not simply borne by individual depositors, and their losses — but by entire communities. It was, after all, the Great Depression. That means they understood that leaving a pool of large uninsured depositors would still subject their banks to runs. Indeed runs, even then, were set off by large uninsured depositors and not ordinary retail depositors.\n\n\nAs I wrote about two weeks ago, the growing mismatch between deposit insurance caps and potential large depositors is leading to recurring runs. If they don’t happen in the banking system itself, they happen in the shadow banking system. The consequences of shadow banking runs in the Great Financial Crisis were enormous. The ordinary people who astutely advocated for deposit insurance in the aftermath of the banking panics and failures of the Great Depression understood the great benefits of avoiding such episodes. They advanced this cause despite the protestations of bankers and pundits.\n\nSubscribe\n\nThe idea that these benefits are “regressive” would come off to them as very strange to them. So would the idea that we should risk all this social havoc in the hopes that massive bank failures would serve as a random and exploding wealth tax. The record of banking panics is not favorable to such ideas. Indeed, the rescue of Silicon Valley Bank illustrates that the alternative to full deposit insurance is not lack of protection for the richest and most powerful, but protection through governmental lending and ad-hoc actions to benefit them specifically. (That’s also what the Hoover era history of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation shows us.)\n\n\nIf we’re going to treat banks as a public utility, there is a very strong argument for banning buybacks, capping dividends and capping executive pay. You could even tax away the rest of their proceeds as a “franchise tax”. But that’s a story for another time. I also agree that “revenue” from these banks are not sufficient compensation to the public for franchising the ability to create money. After all, I have been advocating qualitative and quantitative credit regulation for a while now. Banking will not be shaped in the public interest without strong public regulation. But deposit insurance limitations provide no public benefits… only the public cost of illusions. Financial institutions innovate alternatives to uninsured deposits as a service, rather than leaving them with the unenviable task of serving as a private banking regulator. They create more financial fragility and instability along the way. The populists were right. We should heed their message, rather than falling into the means testing trap yet again.\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p><em>This is a free piece of Notes on the Crises. </em></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>It’s five weeks to the day since the bank run on Silicon Valley Bank. In that time, intellectual fault lines have solidified. At first dazed, the centrist banking scholars have rallied. In their view many things need fixing. Banking supervision, banking regulation, credit rating agencies, auditors and irresponsible creditors all need fixing. The one thing that does not need fixing: deposit insurance. As the panic has subsided from our mini-panic, the old attacks on deposit insurance have come to the forefront. The age-old claim that deposit insurance “punishes” sound banks (through greater insurance charges) and uniquely encourages irresponsible risk taking have returned with a vengeance. The latest missive comes from the Brookings Institution’s Aaron Klein. Klein's latest, published in the Wall Street Journal, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-fdr-limited-fdic-coverage-silicon-valley-bank-deposit-insurance-risk-small-business-8cee7518?ref=crisesnotes.com\">is a piece entitled</a>: “Why FDR Limited FDIC Coverage: The objective was to protect depositors, not rich people and big companies”<br></p><p>The core claim of the piece is that full deposit insurance subverts some sort of original intent of federal deposit insurance circa 1933:</p><blockquote>Federal deposit insurance was aimed at protecting the savings of the poor and middle class while leaving the rich to manage the risks of their large deposits. Extending it to large corporations and the wealthy would harm working people.</blockquote><blockquote>When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Banking Act of 1933, it capped coverage at $2,500. The current cap of $250,000 covers about 98% of Americans.</blockquote><p>Those who read me regularly will know full well I am on record <strong>strongly disagreeing with Aaron Klein’s perspective.</strong> It is no secret that I’m an advocate of full deposit insurance and <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/every-complex-banking-issue-all-at-once-the-failure-of-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-brief-summary-and-five-quick-implications/\">put basically no stock</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-night-they-reread-pozsar-in-his-absence/\">“market discipline” supposedly provided</a> by deposit insurance. However, my disagreement with Klein is not what motivated me to write a response to it. Instead, what bothered me was the misrepresentation of this crucial piece of economic and legal history. <br></p><p>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was not some principled and long time advocate of partial deposit insurance. Instead, he was a total opponent of deposit insurance who, in the middle of a political fight where new banking legislation was urgently needed, accepted a limited form of deposit insurance. Even more importantly, the proposal on the table was for <em>full</em> deposit insurance and was subsequently negotiated down to partial deposit insurance in congress. Then <strong>even still</strong> it was FDR’s opposition to <strong>partial</strong> deposit insurance which held up legislation at a critical time <strong>for months</strong>.<br></p><p>Now, in fairness to Mr. Klein, I was primed by the headline which begins “Why FDR Limited FDIC Coverage”. Most of the time Op Ed writers do not pick their own headlines so he isn’t responsible for the framing the reader first encounters. Nevertheless, I think his description above also lends itself to the false impression that the system we inherited is a product of considered design… rather than <strong>completely opposing visions which were compromised in the end. </strong>Before explaining Roosevelt’s place in this story, I think it's worth taking a step back and explaining the congressional context.<br></p><p>The key to understanding how we ended up with capped deposit insurance is to understand a completely forgotten aspect of the Banking Act of 1933. Specifically we have to consider the four provisions known as the “Glass-Steagall Act”. Today the names Carter Glass and Henry Steagall are extremely closely associated. It is barely remembered that there was any difference between them at all. However, the political import of the Glass-Steagall provisions is <strong>precisely</strong> that they were generated by two important figures who had <strong>opposing</strong> views on banking reform. Glass, well known for shepherding the 1913 Federal Reserve Act through the house, was a fierce opponent of deposit insurance and focused instead on limiting the investment activities of chartered banks (Glass often referred to those investments as “gambling”). <br></p><p>In contrast, Henry Steagall had been proposing deposit insurance for years. Even more importantly, he was proposing a <strong>full deposit guarantee</strong>. A CQ <a href=\"https://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1932032400&ref=crisesnotes.com\">Research report from 1932</a> is worth quoting at length on this point:</p><blockquote>Other proposals offered during the present session range all the way from self-insurance of deposits by national banks and bond-surety systems to an <strong>outright guarantee</strong> by the federal government of the <strong>full amount</strong> of all deposits in all state and national banks. The bill that will receive most attention is that offered by Chairman Steagall, now pending before the House Banking and Currency Committee.<br></blockquote><blockquote>The Steagall bill would create a “Federal Bank Liquidating Board” to liquidate failed member banks of the Federal reserve system and administer the guaranty fund it proposes. The board would be allowed 30 days for an appraisal of the assets of an insolvent bank. A first payment to depositors would be required 60 days after the failure. This first payment would be not less than 50 per cent of all individual deposits under $1,000, On other deposits 25 per cent would be paid, except where 25 per cent amounted to less than 8500, in which case $500 would be paid.<br></blockquote><blockquote>Six months later the board would be required to pay the remaining 50 per cent due on deposits of less than $1.000 and an additional 25 per cent on other deposits. Depositors not paid in full would receive an additional 25 percent 14 months after the failure. Six months later the board would pay all depositors in full and take whatever assets might remain. These assets would be disposed of for the benefit of the guaranty fund.<br></blockquote><blockquote>Under this system depositors with claims of less than $1,000 would be paid in full at the end of a maximum period of eight months, and <strong>all other depositors would be paid in full</strong> at the expiration of a maximum period of 20 months.<br></blockquote><p>Thus, the only significant difference between small and large depositors in this scheme is the <strong>speed</strong> at which they would be made whole. Given that Steagall of Glass-Steagall fame was proposing full deposit insurance, the claim that capped deposit insurance was the wise and well thought out ideal emerging from the “New Deal” looks far more suspect. Which brings us to Roosevelt.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Roosevelt’s role at this time is even more obscure than the divisions between Senator Glass and House Representative Steagall. He was not simply totally opposed to deposit insurance, he held up banking reform <strong>for months</strong> because of his opposition. As the bevy of headlines in the header image illustrate, banking reform was not simply held up over the issue of deposit insurance: it was specifically held up over <strong>Roosevelt’s general opposition</strong>. Long after Glass and Steagall had compromised over a partial deposit insurance scheme, Roosevelt was still holding up the process. President Roosevelt’s “off the record” comment to a reporter <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-conference-25?ref=crisesnotes.com\">at a March 8th 1933 press conference</a> probably reflects both his personal and his political opinion at the time:<br></p><blockquote>Any form of general guarantee means a definite loss to the Government. The objective in the plan that we are working on can be best stated this way: There are undoubtedly some banks that are not going to pay one hundred cents on the dollar. We all know it is better to have that loss taken than to jeopardize the credit of the United States Government or to put the United States Government further in debt. Therefore, the one objective is going to be to keep the loss in the individual banks down to a minimum, endeavoring to get 100 percent on them. We do not wish to make the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future. </blockquote><p>In this and other comments opposing deposit insurance, Roosevelt reflected <a href=\"https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1933/05/21/100886826.html?pageNumber=71&ref=crisesnotes.com\">the near unanimous views of bankers</a>, especially branch banks (a topic I will return to later). By this I do not mean he was in the pocket of bankers, but simply that<strong> his aristocratic opinion reflected their elite opinion</strong>. His comments seem genuine to me. The importance of this is that when Klein invokes FDR’s views he is, knowingly or unknowingly, reflecting banker arguments against deposit insurance <strong>in general</strong>. He is certainly invoking Roosevelt’s arguments against any kind of deposit insurance. If we find those arguments against deposit insurance wanting, then it is more unclear why we should suddenly find them valid in the case of partial deposit insurance. <br></p><p>This brings us to the question of why Roosevelt changed his mind, and why an otherwise lockstep congress so vigorously disagreed with an extremely popular president.

Please take out a paid subscription if you want pieces to continue to be free.\n\nSubscribe\n\nLong time readers of Notes on the Crises will know that I’m an advocate of the Federal Reserve issuing its own securities. In fact, it's been almost exactly three years since I first wrote about this idea for Notes on the Crises. Please do go read my original piece if you are unfamiliar, but to recap: currently the United States Treasury issues treasury securities to fill up its account at the Federal Reserve. That means that on a consolidated basis, in other words combining all the government agencies and government corporations together, the federal government emits “money” (more narrowly defined) into the rest of the economy when it spends and sells government securities, after the fact. I’ll explain what I mean by “more narrowly defined” later on. The key point right now is that the assignment of creating checking account balances to the Federal Reserve and securities to the treasury obscures the lessons that consolidating the Federal Government, for the purposes of macroeconomic analysis, provides.\n\n\nIf you instead gave both agencies direct and overt money creation powers, while assigning securities issuance to the Federal Reserve, what is now covert and hidden will be revealed. The “national debt” is a scary idea that drives politics. The outstanding stock of “Federal Reserve securities” would be a boring detail only nerds like me care about. It would also provide the Federal Reserve complete control over the quantities and prices at every part of the yield curve, which its reliance on treasury securities auctions today limits. This is most clearly seen in the conduct of “balance sheet” policy over the past fourteen years. With “quantitative easing” the Federal Reserve bought many longer maturity treasury securities. When it wanted to engage in “quantitative tightening”, i.e. selling securities, its choices to sell were limited. Instead of being able to issue short maturity securities, it had to sell longer maturity securities or simply wait for securities to mature, and not buy more. They chose to do the latter, and it has been a grindingly slow process.\n\n\nOf course, this proposal remains at the margins. Its benefits have not been widely extolled. It has been proposed in legislation co-authored by my colleague Rohan Grey. But we remain its core advocates and while we gain influence every day, to say the least, we are nowhere near making policy that changes the behavior of the Federal Reserve or the Treasury. As a result, I was surprised to come across a memo authored by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board and the New York Federal Reserve Bank in June 2009 entitled “Implementation Strategies for the Issuance of Federal Reserve Discount Note Obligations”. “Federal Reserve Discount Note Obligations” is just a somehow more dry way of saying “Federal Reserve securities” (of a particular type…more on that later).\n\n\nAs far as I can tell, no one else has noticed that this memo was declassified on May 21st 2021. That means the piece you are reading right now is the first public commentary on this memo, and its implications for Federal Reserve monetary policy. This memo is important because it establishes how widely and seriously the idea of the Federal Reserve issuing its own short maturity securities was taken. Of course, I knew that this had been discussed in 2008 and 2009 briefly, but I had not realized the extent to which the Federal Reserve not only believed in this option, but thought it was something of an “ideal” one. A speech from May 2009 from none other than then San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank president Janet Yellen is worth quoting:\n\nAn alternative approach that could accomplish the same goal, and perhaps do it better, would be something completely new for the Federal Reserve—that’s to issue interest-bearing debt broadly to private investors. Let’s call this debt Fed bills. Congress would have to authorize this, but it too is a tool available to many central banks. The sale of Fed bills would reduce the reserves of the banking system, as in a typical contractionary open-market operation. As with interest on reserves, we could accomplish a tightening of policy while maintaining our support of credit markets. But Fed bills would have an advantage over interest on reserves. The loans to the Fed would come from investors throughout the economy, not just from banks. At a time when we need banks to lend to the private sector to fight a credit crunch, this is a decided plus.\n\nThis is a very interesting excerpt. It shows that many in the Federal Reserve not only supported Federal Reserve issued securities, they thought it was superior to the current monetary policy framework. Previous to reading the Fed staff memo, I would have found such comments interesting, but perfunctory. In context, it is clear to me that they took this idea very seriously, and likely stopped talking about it for only two reasons.\n\n\nFirst, this proposal was simply going nowhere with congress. Congress had no appetite for giving the Federal Reserve even more power. The Fed, for its part, was limited to technocratic appeals which don’t communicate the true political possbility of Federal Reserve securities. As another memo issued the exact same day says “At present, the legislative environment does not appear to be favorable for such an initiative”. Second, over time the Federal Reserve grew comfortable with setting interest rates through paying interest on reserves. There were some remaining issues  as these memos illustrate. However, practical experience assuaged a number of concerns. They also could use reverse repurchase agreements with their existing legal authority to drain settlement balances from the banking system, and “support” interest rates. I will be writing about the reverse repurchase facility sometime soon.\n\n\nAnother interesting element of this memo, and other similar discussions at the time, is the most direct alternative to “Fed bills” that was under discussion- a new program for issuing treasury bills. Called the “Supplementary Financing Program”- was actually done in 2008 to drain settlement balances. The banking system had far more settlement balances  after the Federal Reserve crisis facilities filled it up. It's worth emphasizing that these were issued purely for monetary policy purposes and were held in a separate “SFP” account at the Federal Reserve. So why didn’t they go with this option on an ongoing basis?\n\n\nBecause of none other than the debt ceiling! This is an area where the debt ceiling has directly interfered with the conduct of monetary policy, and is part of why the treasury does not issue short maturity securities in the quantities that Zoltan Pozsar thinks is necessary to provision safe assets and “crowd out” shadow banking. As the memo says:\n\nThe effect of the SFP, therefore, is economically equivalent to the issuance of FDN. The outstanding size of the program, which peaked at about $560 billion in October 2008, has since then shrunk to about $200 billion, partly reflecting Treasury’s concerns about breaching the debt ceiling limit [...]  bills issued under the [expanded]  SFP would be excluded from the debt ceiling\n\nPozsar, and many other theorists, treat short maturity treasury securities as a form of money, albeit not one you can directly make payment with like the settlement balances I have discussed at length today (and will continue to). This is what I meant when I said settlement balances were money in a “narrow” sense earlier on. Treasury bills are money in a “broader” sense. As always, what money is depends on your level of analysis.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAnyway, the memo also proposes that Federal Reserve securities themselves be exempt from the debt ceiling. However, even with the debt ceiling exemption they still articulate problems with the Supplementary Financing Bills for precisely the reasons I highlighted at the beginning of this piece:\n\nThis constraint, however, illustrates a significant shortcoming of the current SFP in comparison with the proposed FDN program—the Federal Reserve does not have complete control over the size and timing of SFP debt issuance. In order to address these issues and as an alternative to FDNs, the SFP could be revised to require the Treasury to issue obligations promptly at the request of the Chairman of the Board. [...] Although the revised SFP would achieve similar monetary policy objectives, FDN issuance is a preferable instrument as its ultimate decisions would reside within the Federal Reserve, and consequently, there would be a more limited need for coordination on a daily basis with Treasury. In addition, although the legislation would grant control of the SFP to the Federal Reserve, market participants might perceive such a program as not truly being under the control of the Federal Reserve, with possible negative implications in the public perception of Fed independence\n\nThus, the official opinion of the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff was, as of 2009, that the concentration of security issuance in the U.S. treasury makes the Federal Reserve dependent on the Treasury and disrupts their control over monetary policy implementation.\n\n\nOf course, they are proposing short maturity securities. They are not proposing Federal Reserve securities across the yield curve. The draft legislative text in the memo limits the maturities to a maximum of one year. In fact, they even suggest only issuing securities with a maturity of less than four weeks. This is because they envision these securities co-existing with treasury securities, and are concerned about “fragmenting” liquidity for government securities. This issue of “fragmentation” is in fact the central “problem”, outside of legislative authorization, they see facing Federal Reserve securities. Interestingly enough, there is only one mention of “Fed Bills” on the Treasury website. It is, however, an extraordinarily useful one that summarizes the similarities and differences between Fed Bills and SFP Bills. I believe it demonstrates the superiority of a Federal Reserve security “only” approach.\n\n\n\nIn a battle between a technical issue of liquidity fragmentation (i.e. two instruments of the similar maturities serving the same purpose), and perceptions of treasury control or influence over monetary policy, the solvable problem of liquidity fragmentation emerges as the lesser problem. Government officials were timid and reactive in all sorts of ways in 2009. This area is just one of many where that was true. But with greater understanding and time to reflect, the wisdom of the Federal Reserve securities approach is becoming clearer and clearer, in the time of recurrent shadow banking runs and recurrent debt ceiling crises. Read closely, these very establishment documents provide intellectual support for that approach.\n\nSubscribe\n\nNotwithstanding the last paragraph, there are still some operational issues to discuss with the “Federal Reserve securities only” proposal. For one thing, the memo proposes that the securities become a joint liability of all Federal Reserve Banks. This liability would then be periodically divided up on an accounting basis, much like the securities (that is, the assets) acquired in Federal Reserve system purchases are divided in what is called the “System Open Market Account” (SOMA). I don’t like this for a number of reasons, one of which is that that would make these securities a matter of governmental corporations (or “instrumentalities\") rather than agencies. An alternative would be for the Federal Reserve Board to be the issuer of the securities, and the proceeds go into its account. That’s right, for all the talk about the “Federal Reserve creating money”, the part of the Fed in Washington DC technically does not “create money” itself. Instead, it imposes a “levy” on Federal Reserve Banks to cover its expenses, then leaves those funds in accounts at one or more Federal Reserve Banks.\n\n\nThis modification to the proposal has a number of advantages. First, it means that reserve banks can simply purchase and hold Federal Reserve Board Securities and earn interest on those holdings just like they earn interest on treasury securities today even though these are government securities. The issue of Federal Reserve Bank income could be dealt with in different ways, but this is a simple approach which fits closely with current practice. When interest payments are made, the Federal Reserve Board could simply book a corresponding asset in a “Monetary Policy Conduct Account” so that its net worth does not change. In this way, the concerns of right wing critics of alternative monetary policy arrangements can be allievated.\n\n\nThis brings us to the second issue, that of  treasury finance. Without treasuries, the United States Treasury would need an alternative financing tool. In fact, the issue of treasury powers was one of the things that stymied Albert Hart’s original proposal. In his proposal, the Treasury would be financed by an unlimited overdraft at the Federal Reserve. Economist George Bach says about such a proposal in his widely read but now forgotten 1950 book “Federal Reserve Policy-Making” that it “would result in a drastic reduction in traditional Treasury powers, probably too drastic to be tolerable to the government's chief financial agency.” As we’ve seen this year with the discussion of the Federal Reserve’s fiscal agent role, relying on the Federal Reserve to fully pursue its fiscal agent mandate does not inspire full confidence.\n\nHowever, I think this is an issue that should be revisited more than seventy years later. As I discussed in Financial Times Alphaville earlier this year, since the late 1940s the treasury has nearly fully handed over operational responsibility for interest payments, securities tracking and securities issuance to the Federal Reserve. In the late 1940s the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was still literally “printing bonds” and securities issuance and allocation was facilitated by the Federal Reserve, but it was not fully controlled by it. The Treasury could have, in theory at least, still have sold physical securities to banks for bank deposits and even those bank payments could have been cleared on an alternative payment system to Fedwire to avoid Federal Reserve interference. This is an extreme scenario, but it illustrates that it is literally true that giving up security issuance at that time would have been giving up a significant amount of operational power. When treasury securities were fully turned into a non-physical book entry system, this operational power disappeared.  The only thing that hasn’t changed is the accounting arrangements that lie behind that issuance.\n\n\nThus, as a practical matter the Treasury relinguished operational independence from the Federal Reserve and thus fully relies on the Federal Reserve legally fulfilling its fiscal agent role. This was the core point I was making in the Financial Times. Security issuance to avoid the debt ceiling, especially breaking the debt ceiling, has the same operational risks as issuing the trillion dollar platinum coin. I’d even go so far as to argue it has less since depositing the coin is the most operationally simple workaround of the debt ceiling and most directly and clearly implicates its fiscal agent role. If the Federal Reserve won’t accept this deposit, what other deposits won’t it accept? Symbolically and legally the trillion dollar coin also represents direct treasury monetary creation, which going into debt to the Federal Reserve with an overdraft does not.\n\n\nHow does the platinum coin fit in with the proposal for Federal Reseve Securities? Quite well, as long as you have the Board issue the securities. George Selgin’s long standing concern that platinum coins are a threat to Federal Reserve Bank income can be solved in other ways, but Federal Reserve Board Securities solves those concerns cleanly. When a platinum coin is deposited with a Federal Reserve Bank, it fills up the Treasury’s checking account. The Treasury then spends. There are more settlement balances in the banking system. The Federal Reserve Board can then issue more Federal Reserve Board securities, draining those settlement balances. The lack of interest the Reserve Bank is earning from the coin is matched by the lack of interest it is paying to the Federal Reserve Board. There is no problem of lost income here.\n\n\nWe can, in fact, go further. Not only is there no problem of lost income, authorizing the Federal Reserve Board to issue securities facilitates permanently solving the issue of Reserve Bank income. The Federal Reserve Board could always issue securities and sell them directly to Reserve Banks. This would always provide them additional income. The board could even “purchase”  the platinum coins off of Federal Reserve Bank balance sheets with Federal Reserve Board securities. They can also engage in operations the Treasury currently does, swapping new FRB securities for maturing securities or, really, securities of any maturity. In this way Federal Reserve Banks can cleanly and easily acquire securities of any maturity and denomination they want, in any quantity they want, when engaging in open market operations.\n\n\nThe only remaining issue is that of “remittances”. Since the Treasury no longer needs any non-”seigniorage” inflows into its accounts (it still needs tax collection for macroeconomic reasons), Federal Reserve System remittances would serve no purpose. Worse, since this reorganization of Federal Reserve accounting relationships means that the Federal Reserve Board can always generate income for Federal Reserve Banks by selling them more securities, their income would be completely arbitrary. Meanwhile, since the Federal Reserve Board is now taking responsibility for interest payments, the Federal Reserve System on a consolidated basis would now be (usually) running a cash deficit, offset by the “Monetary Policy Conduct Account” entry. Using its existing “levy” authority, the Federal Reserve Board could appropriate all of the Federal Reserve Bank’s “residual net earnings”. That would lead the Board to mark down the “Monetary Policy Conduct Account”.\n\nSubscribe\n\nGeorge Selgin will probably still not be fully satisfied with this accounting reorganization because the interest payments would not be reflected on the Treasury’s balance sheet- but why should they? It’s the Federal Reserve which is deciding that interest payments on government liabilities should be positive. That decision should be reflected on their balance sheet. Where Selgin sees the menace of “Fiscal QE”, I see the menace of covert central bank fiscal policy. They cause interest payments, under existing arrangements, for another agency they do not take responsibility for. Furthermore, the entire federal government should be reflected in fiscal deficit measures and, properly consolidated with the rest of the federal government, negative net income of the Federal Reserve System would be reflected in the consolidated fiscal deficit.\n\n\nAt this point the reader's head must be swimming. I’m sorry to add to it, but I have one more thing to discuss. Technological change has not only eliminated the basis for the original operational objection to Hart’s proposal. It has also opened up greater space for the operational independence of Treasury money creation. In addition to the platinum coin, a Digital Fiat Currency could provide the payment rails for the Treasury to create currency and directly send payments throughout the economy. These currency balances (meaning they are not accounts) could be held in digital wallets with banks, paypal, venmo, and all sorts of other apps- including publicly (or post office) administered digital wallets. My understanding is that this same integrated hardware software set up can also facilitate a new accounts layer on top of the digital currency payment rails. My colleague Rohan Grey has been a visionary pioneer in this space, writing about it just as the corollary idea of a “Central Bank Digital Currency” was just getting going in elite circles, let alone public consciousness. I can tell you based on my personal experience that when I met him 11 years ago, this was already an embryonic topic of conversation.\n\n\nThis is, of course, something that needs to be talked about at much greater length elsewhere. For our purposes today, what’s relevant is that not only has the existing Treasury lost the battle over operational financial independence from the Federal Reserve, there are new technologies which can reinvigorate operational independence through direct money creation. Giving up securities issuance is not the diminution it would have been seventy years ago. Concerns about the treasury engaging in its own monetary policy can be alleviated by legally restricting the financial activities it can engage in. In doing so, the Federal Reserve would still be at the height of monetary policy operational independence. That means it would just not be able to say nonsensical things about “fiscal sustainability”, or politically wield the illusory threat of fiscal crises. The debate will be purely about the macroeconomic implications of different policies in terms of aggregate demand, inflation, recessions, income inequality….and other real concerns.\n\n\nTo recap, this memo provides four key lessons about monetary policy:\n\n 1. The Federal Reserve took actions in 2008 concerned that crisis facilities would interfere with the conduct of monetary policy. They expended political effort to drain settlement balances by asking the U.S. treasury to issue treasury bills referred to as “supplementary financing bills” that were purely issued in order to serve a monetary policy purpose. They expended political effort proposing Federal Resreve bill issuance. A major reason this political battle was abandoned is that over the course of 2009, the Federal Reserve realized that they had sufficient tools to raise interest rates, if “necessary”.\n 2. While my proposal is still outside of the bounds of current mainstream political discourse, it's not outside the bounds of technocratic discussion among Federal Reserve experts. This memo is a rare revealing look into that technocratic discourse, with many profound implications\n 3. The debt ceiling is interfering with the conduct of monetary policy far more profoundly than many realize, even when it isn’t that close to binding. It needs to be done away with, Federal Reserve Board securities and direct and overt treasury monetary creation is one way of accomplishing that parsimonously\n 4. The  book-entryification of treasury securities that began in the 1960s, as well as the emergence of digital fiat currency hardware & software technologies recently, creates a far different technological context for proposals to reorganize monetary policy implementation. Today the Treasury is giving up a lot less, and gaining a lot more, in letting the Federal Reserve fully take over the security issuance process and simply engage in direct monetary finance. Interest on reserves combined with Federal Reserve Board Securities, preserves the Federal Reserve’s ability to conduct monetary policy under such conditions.\n\nThat’s it for today. I recommend rereading this piece over the weekend, there’s a lot here.\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p><em>This is a free piece of Notes on the Crises.

In fact, it's been almost exactly three years since <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/we-should-authorize-the-federal-reserve/\">I first wrote about </a>this idea for <em>Notes on the Crises</em>. Please do go read <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/we-should-authorize-the-federal-reserve/\">my original piece</a> if you are unfamiliar, but to recap: currently the United States Treasury issues treasury securities to fill up its account at the Federal Reserve. That means that on a consolidated basis, in other words <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-government-always-money/\">combining all the government agencies and</a> government corporations together, the federal government emits “money” (more narrowly defined) into the rest of the economy when it spends and sells government securities, after the fact. I’ll explain what I mean by “more narrowly defined” later on. The key point right now is that the assignment of creating checking account balances to the Federal Reserve and securities to the treasury obscures the lessons that <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-government-always-money/\">consolidating the Federal Government</a>, for the purposes of macroeconomic analysis, provides. <br></p><p>If you instead gave both agencies direct and overt money creation powers, while assigning securities issuance to the Federal Reserve, what is now covert and hidden will be revealed. The “national debt” is a scary idea that drives politics. The outstanding stock of “Federal Reserve securities” would be a boring detail only nerds like me care about. It would also provide the Federal Reserve complete control over the quantities and prices at every part of the yield curve, which its reliance on treasury securities auctions today limits. This is most clearly seen in the conduct of “balance sheet” policy over the past fourteen years. With “quantitative easing” the Federal Reserve bought many longer maturity treasury securities. When it wanted to engage in “quantitative tightening”, i.e. selling securities, its choices to sell were limited. Instead of being able to issue short maturity securities, it had to <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/podcasts/02182019/peter-stella-debt-safe-assets-and-central-bank-operations?ref=crisesnotes.com\">sell longer maturity securities or simply wait</a> for securities to mature, and not buy more. They chose to do the latter, and it has been a grindingly slow process.<br></p><p>Of course, this proposal remains at the margins. Its benefits have not been widely extolled. It has been proposed in legislation co-authored by my <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6553?ref=crisesnotes.com\">colleague Rohan Grey</a>. But we remain its core advocates and while we gain influence every day, to say the least, we are nowhere near making policy that changes the behavior of the Federal Reserve or the Treasury. As a result, I was surprised to come across a memo authored by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board and the New York <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20090612memo04.pdf\">Federal Reserve Bank in June 2009 entitled</a> “Implementation Strategies for the Issuance of Federal Reserve Discount Note Obligations”. “Federal Reserve Discount Note Obligations” is just a somehow more dry way of saying “Federal Reserve securities” (of a particular type…more on that later).<br></p><p>As far as I can tell, no one else has noticed that this memo was declassified on May 21st 2021. That means <strong>the piece you are reading right now is the first public commentary on this memo,</strong> and its implications for Federal Reserve monetary policy. This memo is important because it establishes how widely and seriously the idea of the Federal Reserve issuing its own short maturity securities was taken. Of course, I knew that this had been discussed in 2008 and 2009 briefly, but I had not realized the extent to which the Federal Reserve not only believed in this option, but thought it was something of an “ideal” one. A speech from May 2009 from none other than then San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank president Janet Yellen <a href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/our-district/press/presidents-speeches/yellen-speeches/2009/may/yellen-credit-crunch-global-recession-issues-australia/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">is worth quoting</a>:</p><blockquote>An alternative approach that could accomplish the same goal, and<strong> perhaps do it better</strong>, would be something completely new for the Federal Reserve—that’s to issue interest-bearing debt broadly to private investors. Let’s call this debt <strong>Fed bills</strong>. Congress would have to authorize this, but it too is a tool available to many central banks. The sale of Fed bills would reduce the reserves of the banking system, as in a typical contractionary open-market operation. As with interest on reserves, we could accomplish a tightening of policy while maintaining our support of credit markets. But Fed bills <strong>would have an advantage over interest on reserves</strong>. The loans to the Fed would come from investors throughout the economy, not just from banks. At a time when we need banks to lend to the private sector to fight a credit crunch, this is a <strong>decided plus</strong>.</blockquote><p>This is a very interesting excerpt.

In the late 1940s the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/04v10n3/0412garbpdf.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">still literally “printing bonds” and securities issuance and allocation</a> was facilitated by the Federal Reserve, but it was not fully controlled by it. The Treasury could have, in theory at least, <strong>still have sold physical securities</strong> to banks for bank deposits and even those bank payments could have been cleared on an alternative payment system to Fedwire to avoid Federal Reserve interference. This is an extreme scenario, but it illustrates that it is literally true that giving up security issuance at that time would have been giving up a significant amount of operational power. When treasury securities were fully turned into a non-physical book entry system, <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/04v10n3/0412garbpdf.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">this operational power disappeared</a>.  The only thing that hasn’t changed is the accounting arrangements that lie <strong>behind that issuance. </strong><br></p><p>Thus, as a practical matter the Treasury relinguished operational independence from the Federal Reserve and thus fully relies on the Federal Reserve legally fulfilling its fiscal agent role. This was the core point I was making in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afb6ef8f-be7c-45ac-8a7d-56550b64fd9e?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><strong>Financial Times</strong></a>. Security issuance to avoid the debt ceiling, especially <strong>breaking</strong> the debt ceiling, has the same operational risks as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e9d6924-42af-4892-951e-dee36a020ea7?ref=crisesnotes.com\">issuing the trillion dollar platinum coin</a>. I’d even go so far as to argue it has <strong>less</strong> since depositing the coin is the most operationally simple workaround of the debt ceiling and most directly and clearly implicates its fiscal agent role. If the Federal Reserve won’t accept this deposit, what other deposits won’t it accept? <a href=\"https://rohangrey.net/files/coinage.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Symbolically and legally</a> the trillion dollar coin also represents direct treasury monetary creation, which going into debt to the Federal Reserve with an overdraft does not.<br></p><p>How does the platinum coin fit in with the proposal for Federal Reseve Securities? Quite well, as long as you have the Board issue the securities. George Selgin’s <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/commentary/treasurys-1-trillion-coin-feds-magic-asset?ref=crisesnotes.com\">long standing concern</a> that platinum coins are a threat to Federal Reserve Bank income can be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NathanTankus/status/1621324545360642048?ref=crisesnotes.com\">solved in other ways</a>, but Federal Reserve Board Securities solves those concerns cleanly. When a platinum coin is deposited with a Federal Reserve Bank, it fills up the Treasury’s checking account. The Treasury then spends. There are more settlement balances in the banking system. The Federal Reserve Board can then issue more Federal Reserve Board securities, draining those settlement balances. The lack of interest the Reserve Bank is earning from the coin is matched by the lack of interest it is <strong>paying</strong> to the Federal Reserve Board. There is no problem of lost income here.<br></p><p>We can, in fact, go further. Not only is there no problem of lost income, authorizing the Federal Reserve Board to issue securities facilitates permanently solving the issue of Reserve Bank income. The Federal Reserve Board could <strong>always</strong> issue securities and <strong>sell them directly</strong> to Reserve Banks. This would <strong>always</strong> provide them additional income. The board could even “purchase”  the platinum coins off of Federal Reserve Bank balance sheets with Federal Reserve Board securities. They can also engage in operations the Treasury currently does, swapping new FRB securities for maturing securities or, really, securities of any maturity. In this way Federal Reserve Banks can cleanly and easily acquire securities of any maturity and denomination they want, in any <strong>quantity they want</strong>, when engaging in open market operations.<br></p><p>The only remaining issue is that of “remittances”. Since the Treasury no longer needs any non-”seigniorage” inflows into its accounts (it still needs <a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">tax collection for macroeconomic reasons</a>), Federal Reserve System remittances would serve no purpose. Worse, since this reorganization of Federal Reserve accounting relationships means that the Federal Reserve Board can always generate income for Federal Reserve Banks by selling them more securities, their income would be completely arbitrary. Meanwhile, since the Federal Reserve Board is now taking responsibility for interest payments, the Federal Reserve System on a consolidated basis would now be (usually) running a cash deficit, offset by the “Monetary Policy Conduct Account” entry. Using its existing “levy” authority, the Federal Reserve Board could appropriate all of the Federal Reserve Bank’s <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/chapter-6-reporting-requirements.htm\">“residual net earnings”</a>. That would lead the Board to mark down the “Monetary Policy Conduct Account”.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>George Selgin will probably still not be fully satisfied with this accounting reorganization because the interest payments would not be reflected on the Treasury’s balance sheet- but why should they? It’s the Federal Reserve which is <strong>deciding</strong> that interest payments on government liabilities should be positive. That decision should be reflected on <strong>their</strong> balance sheet. Where Selgin sees the <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/macro-musings/george-selgin-average-inflation-targeting-and-menace-fiscal-qe?ref=crisesnotes.com\">menace of “Fiscal QE”</a>, I see the menace of covert central bank fiscal policy. They <strong>cause</strong> interest payments, under existing arrangements, for another agency they do not take responsibility for. Furthermore, the <strong>entire</strong> federal government should be reflected in fiscal deficit measures and, properly consolidated with the rest of the federal government, negative net income of the Federal Reserve <strong>System</strong> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-government-always-money/\">would be reflected in the consolidated fiscal deficit</a>.<br></p><p>At this point the reader's head must be swimming. I’m sorry to add to it, but I have one more thing to discuss. Technological change has not only eliminated the basis for the original operational objection to Hart’s proposal. It has also opened up <strong>greater </strong>space for the <strong>operational independence</strong> of Treasury money creation. In addition to the platinum coin, a <a href=\"https://rohangrey.net/files/dfc.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Digital Fiat Currency</a> could provide the payment rails for the Treasury to create currency and directly send payments throughout the economy. These currency balances (meaning they are <strong>not</strong> accounts) could be held in digital wallets with banks, paypal, venmo, and all sorts of other apps- including publicly (or post office) administered digital wallets. My understanding is that this same integrated hardware software set up can also facilitate a new accounts layer on top of the digital currency payment rails. My colleague Rohan Grey has been a <a href=\"https://rohangrey.net/files/dfc.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">visionary pioneer in this space</a>, writing about it just as the corollary idea of a “Central Bank Digital Currency” was just getting going in elite circles, let alone public consciousness. I can tell you based on my personal experience that when I met him 11 years ago, this was already an embryonic topic of conversation.<br></p><p>This is, of course, something that needs to be talked about at much greater length elsewhere. For our purposes today, what’s relevant is that not only has the existing Treasury lost the battle over operational financial independence from the Federal Reserve, there are new technologies which can reinvigorate operational independence through direct money creation. Giving up securities issuance is not the diminution it would have been seventy years ago. Concerns about the treasury engaging in its own monetary policy can be alleviated by legally restricting the financial activities it can engage in. In doing so, the Federal Reserve would still be at the height of monetary policy operational independence. That means it would just not be able to say nonsensical things about “fiscal sustainability”, or politically wield the illusory threat of fiscal crises. The debate will be purely about the macroeconomic implications of different policies in terms of aggregate demand, inflation, recessions, income inequality….and other <strong>real</strong> concerns.</p><p><br>To recap, this memo provides four key lessons about monetary policy:</p><ol><li>The Federal Reserve took actions in 2008 concerned that crisis facilities would interfere with the conduct of monetary policy. They expended political effort to drain settlement balances by asking the U.S. treasury to issue treasury bills referred to as “supplementary financing bills” that were <em>purely issued in order to serve a monetary policy purpose. </em>They expended political effort proposing Federal Resreve bill issuance. A major reason this political battle was abandoned is that over the course of 2009, the Federal Reserve realized that they had sufficient tools to raise interest rates, if “necessary”.</li><li>While my proposal is still outside of the bounds of current mainstream political discourse, it's not outside the bounds of technocratic discussion among Federal Reserve experts. This memo is a rare revealing look into that technocratic discourse, with many profound implications</li><li>The debt ceiling is interfering with the conduct of monetary policy far more profoundly than many realize, even when it isn’t <strong>that</strong> <strong>close</strong> to binding. It needs to be done away with, Federal Reserve Board securities and direct and overt treasury monetary creation is one way of accomplishing that parsimonously</li><li>The  book-entryification of treasury securities that began in the 1960s, as well as the emergence of digital fiat currency hardware &amp; software technologies recently, creates a far different technological context for proposals to reorganize monetary policy implementation. Today the Treasury is giving up a lot less, and gaining a lot more, in letting the Federal Reserve fully take over the security issuance process and simply engage in direct monetary finance. Interest on reserves combined with Federal Reserve Board Securities, preserves the Federal Reserve’s ability to conduct monetary policy under such conditions.</li></ol><p>That’s it for today.

Ordinary people may not know much about finance, but quite a few of them know it's important that their bank is an “FDIC Insured bank”. So deposit insurance is not an obscure feature of today’s society in one sense. What is less understood is that deposit insurance is more than important to ordinary households. It’s important to everyone, and in quite profound ways. Specifically, its limits are important. Most of our modern complex financial system is built up from the foundations of the cap on deposit insurance. It’s such an important and foundational point that sometimes those of us who think about these big picture issues forget to emphasize it. To give an example close to my heart, in retrospect I regret that I only briefly mentioned the importance of the bank deposit insurance cap in my report published last year. This issue deserved a far more profound discussion than I gave it there!\n\n\nIn any case, deposit insurance and the issue of uninsured deposits have jumped into the public consciousness since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. I gave my first overview of the issue with deposit insurance caps a little over two weeks ago. But today, I want to do something a little bit different. Rather than focus on the trials and tribulations of the uninsured depositor, I want to focus on the consequences of the sophisticated corporate treasurer or asset manager. One who strategizes around the uncertainties of uninsured deposits.\n\n\nA multitude of voices have claimed that uninsured depositors should not have been saved in this circumstance, because proper “risk management” could have avoided being exposed to such potentially large losses. That may be true, that may not be true. What is certain is that those same “risk management strategies'' have profound consequences for the structure of our financial system that are, to say the least, not unamigiously positive.\n\n\nWhich brings us to Zoltan Pozsar. No figure is more closely associated with the profound consequences of uninsured deposits for the financial system than Pozsar. He gained notoriety as an expert in the shadow banking system (don’t worry, we’ll return to what this means in a second). Pozsar was himself a key architect of the government’s crisis response in 2008 — from the vantage point of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. While he was a visiting scholar at the International Monetary Fund in 2011 to 2012 he wrote a series of papers on the big picture causes of shadow banking, particularly on the “demand” or “customer” side. From late 2012 to February 2015 he was a senior adviser to the United States Treasury.\n\n\nOn first glance then, you might have expected Zoltan to have been prolific during this crisis. No possible financial market meltdown illustrates the power of his analysis more than this crisis. If 2008 was a Minsky moment, this was a Pozsar moment (of course, Minsky had a lot to say about uninsured deposits too). Yet, Pozsar has been nowhere to be found. Why is that? Well, relevant context is that in 2015 Zoltan left his position at the Treasury to become a Managing Director at Credit Suisse where he has written, among other things, dozens of informative “Global Money Notes”.\n\n\nAs readers may be aware, the failure of Silicon Valley Bank led to liquidity strains at Credit Suisse (which has been a bank with fundamental problems for many years now) that ultimately led Swiss regulators to compel UBS to buy Credit Suisse. It is beyond the scope of my piece today to write a full assessment of these events. What is relevant in this context is that Zoltan couldn’t write about uninsured deposits causing wider financial system strains because those strains targeted his bank, specifically. Anything he would write would have undesirable consequences for his own institution. Stepping back, this is quite funny. The best way I can describe why it's funny is with an analogy: Zoltan Pozsar’s employer being taken down because of a run on uninsured deposits is kind of like Issac Newton dying by falling out of an apple tree.\n\n\nSince Pozsar is out of commission for the foreseeable future, I think today it's worth rereading his work in the context of Silicon Valley Bank. Let’s take a deeper look at why some of us are not so enthused about these “sophisticated” cash management practices. Supposedly these eliminate the negative (as opposed to the “positive”) consequences of uninsured deposits, but do things really work out that way? Pozsar’s work suggests that the original negative consequences (that uninsured depositors may take a loss), are just replaced by broader negative consequences in the organization of the broader financial system.\n\n\nThe most important paper from Pozsar related to the issue of deposit insurance is a paper entitled “Institutional Cash Pools and the Triffin Dilemma of the U.S. Banking System”. First, some terminology. Pozsar uses the term “institutional cash pools” for those institutions, such as pension funds, university endowments, insurance companies or bank trust departments that invest large monetary sums in order to get a “sufficient” return. Typically, these entities have a fiduciary and/or trustee relationship to others, which provide legal parameters for how these assets should be managed. Economist Hyman Minsky used the phrase “money manager capitalism” for the same phenomenon. Some assessing this development have replaced references to “money” with “asset” i.e. “asset manager capitalism”. This is meant to reflect that only a small percentage of the assets institutional investors invest in are “money” or have a high degree of “moneyness”. For similar reasons, in my work I’ve used the phrase “financial net worth pools”, rather than “cash pools” as Pozsar does.\n\nSubscribe\n\nWhatever terminology you use, the point is that there are a wide set of institutions which manage literally trillions of dollars of assets. Just like you or I do, these institutions have to hold a certain amount of their funds in “cash”, in order to manage their investments and meet outflows. Deposit insurance caps are a problem for this wider network of institutions, because these caps are sized relative to most household “cash balance needs”. By contrast, they are almost laughably tiny compared to the monetary needs of these institutions. This “mismatch” is a gigantic problem. What the financial services part of the financial system ecosystem did ( and does) is create new financial products in an attempt to solve these problems- for a fee. In short, they invented new types of “money”.\n\n\nZoltan’s paper zooms in on this phenomenon. Before Zoltan’s work there were large discussions of the “shadow banking system”, but they tended to focus on the incentives that financial institutions had to create “shadow money” in order to hold (seemingly) high yielding assets. Pozsar’s work flips this perspective. Instead he asks, why is there such a large and deep customer base for shadow money? The answer he provides is- deposit insurance caps. It’s worth quoting Pozsar at length here:\n\nAs the limits of slicing and spreading growing institutional cash pools in fixed, insured increments across a shrinking number of banks and against binding unsecured exposure limits were reached, institutional cash pools faced two alternatives:\n\n\n(i) holding uninsured deposits and becoming uninsured, unsecured creditors to banks, or\n\n\n(ii) investing in insured deposit alternatives—that is, safe, short-term and liquid instruments—such as short-term\n\n\n(ii/a) government guaranteed instruments or\n\n\n(ii/b) a range of privately guaranteed instruments (secured instruments and money funds) issued by the so-called “shadow” banking system.\n\n\nWith only a limited appetite for direct, unsecured exposures to banks through uninsured deposits, however, institutional cash pools opted for the second set of alternatives. Relative to the aggregate volume of institutional cash pools, however, there was an insufficient supply of short-term government-guaranteed instruments to serve as insured deposit alternatives [...[ With a shortage of short-term government-guaranteed instruments, institutional cash pools next gravitated—almost by default—toward the other alternative of privately guaranteed instruments\n\n\nI will return to the issue of “insufficient supply of short-term government-guaranteed instruments” in another piece. For today, what matters is that the key element of uninsured deposits is that they are “unsecured” i.e. not collateralized. This has two issues. 1) you’re less protected against loss because you’re exposed to all of a bank’s potential losses, rather than simply the value of one asset (the collateral). 2) Worse, you have the threat of illiquidity. Even if you will ultimately be paid back, the time it takes the FDIC to fully dispose of the bank’s assets can potentially be quite long. In the meantime, you have a “receivership certificate” which, to say the least, is not an attractive asset to hold. The attractive feature of secured claims- that is collateralized IOUs- is that in case of default you can sell the collateral- and typically quite quickly. Even the extreme case of taking the exact same loss with shadow money that you would have with uninsured deposits favors shadow money because you realize the loss quickly and have liquid funds on hand rather than an illiquid claim that will take- at the very least- months to resolve itself. At least, in theory\n\n\nWhich leads to the negative consequences part. This search for collateralized shadow monies to replace uncollateralized uninsured deposits is not some harmless, costless process. Indeed the very term shadow banking was coined by Paul McCulley in 2007 to describe a set of “non-bank” financial institutions which ultimately themselves experienced a run… A “shadow bank run”, if you will. Recall that the thing that makes today’s shadow money valuable is that “even” in the case of default, and you can sell the underlying collateral quickly and easily. In other words, the collateral is safe and liquid. Just as losses (whether unrealized or realized) can cause a run by uninsured depositors, potential losses can cause a run by shadow money holders. Remember 2007 and 2008? Remember a little instrument called a Mortgage-Backed Security? It should not surprise you to learn that these were one of the key forms of safe collateral which “collateralized” shadow money. Oops!\n\nSubscribe\n\nThat there was a “shadow” bank run is one of the less discussed elements of the financial crisis in popular culture but to those of us obsessed with the structure of the financial system, it's a key element of the whole episode. It’s also important to understand that while loss fears triggered these runs, the key deadly element was the collapse of liquidity. Ultimately, the highest rated private mortgage backed securities (AAA) were the principal taken-as-safe collateral for these shadow monies. AAA MBS securities ultimately took only a couple percentage points of losses on average. Remember that, as I explained at length in 2020, Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) are a different instrument entirely.\n\n\n\nThe point is that ultimately, even the extreme and fraudulent activities which emerged during the 2000s housing boom were not enough to create losses in the safest portion (or tranche) of Mortgage Backed Securities. In this sense, the financial engineering actually worked. The problem was all the financial byproducts (the lower- especially the lowest- tranches) and the inappropriate further use of these financial engineering tools. Again, to learn about this in more detail read my 2020 piece on the topic. Where the financial engineering completely failed is in creating an asset that truly had the liquidity of government securities. The losses may have ultimately been small, but there was no way to know that in the moment. That fear made these assets illiquid.\n\n\nYou might even remember the terminology that emerged at the time to describe this: toxic assets. What the public did not understand at the time is that while fear of losses may have made them toxic, the real issue of toxicity was “liquidity”. The shadow banking system had collapsed as a result of runs which meant the multi-trillion dollar system which financed them no longer existed. The only possible solution was the chartered banking system directly financing the holding of AAA mortgage-backed securities (which it was in no position to do) or else the government stepping in. The money creation process which generated liquidity in these securities markets collapsed and only government balance sheets- i.e. government money creation- could fill the void. You know the rest of the story from here.\n\n\nThe larger issue Zoltan Pozsar is highlighting in this paper is that when you look beyond narrow measures of “the money supply”, deposit insurance is providing less and less protection as these financial net worth pools grow and grow. He says this outright in the paper:\n\nIndeed, if institutional cash pools continue to rely on banks as their credit and liquidity put providers of last resort, the secular rise of uninsured institutional cash pools relative to the size of insured deposits is going to make the U.S. financial system increasingly run-prone, not unlike it used to be prior to the creation of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Put another way, the secular rise of cash pools reduces the effectiveness of deposit insurance in promoting system-stability, if depository institutions are wired to serve as insurers of last resort for the world’s uninsured dollar liquidity\n\nPozsar himself proposes various incremental policy reforms which would limit these issues. He does not suggest getting rid of the deposit insurance cap himself. I briefly touched on the broader range of solutions proposed by a range of thinkers in my piece from earlier this month on Silicon Valley Bank. At some point I will write an entire piece on these solutions, including running through Pozsar’s recommendations in this paper.\n\nSubscribe\n\nRegardless of the potential solutions, I think rereading Pozsar illustrates that the “sophisticated cash management” which has been invoked to criticize “unsophisticated” uninsured depositors has a downside. Shadow bank runs are no better than bank runs. Indeed, in some ways they are worse because shadow banks don’t have direct discount window access. When 13(3) is invoked to effectively give them discount window access, they get the benefits of banking powers without the costs (bank regulation). In this sense, I salute “unsophisticated” uninsured depositors. They have been an unheralded defender of financial stability. We don’t need shadow banking to expand further.\n\n\nWhich leads me to one final topic before I leave readers today. If you look carefully at this piece, none of it is about careful monitoring of balance sheets and credit risks because these “financial net worth pools” do not have the benefits of deposit insurance. Instead, this piece has mostly been about collateral. In some fundamental sense, institutional investors want collateral because they don’t want to do careful credit monitoring. The dream of “market discipline” crashes against a wave of financial engineering in the real world. The Great Financial Crisis involved a lot of complicated factors. One factor it was completely missing was the careful monitoring of credit risks and uncertainties and assurance of borrower creditworthiness. As I said in 2020, ideally creditors would like to replace creditworthiness with collateralworthiness.\n\n\nLeaning completely on collateral is the opposite of careful monitoring of balance sheets. Asset managers seek out being “fully collateralized” precisely to limit the number of actors whose default uncertainties (and overall credit worthiness) they have to assess.\n\n\nThis is clearest in the case of the latest innovation in shadow money- “cash sweep” programs. These programs, which I discussed two weeks ago, use financial technology to take your large uninsured deposit and break it up into literally hundreds of insured deposits at various banks.

Ordinary people may not know much about finance, but quite a few of them know it's important that their bank is an “FDIC Insured bank”. So deposit insurance is not an obscure feature of today’s society in one sense. What is less understood is that deposit insurance is more than important to ordinary households. It’s important to everyone, and in quite profound ways. Specifically, its <em>limits</em> are important. Most of our modern complex financial system is built up from the foundations of the <em>cap</em> on deposit insurance. It’s such an important and foundational point that sometimes those of us who think about these big picture issues forget to emphasize it. To give an example close to my heart, in retrospect I regret that I only briefly mentioned the importance of the bank deposit insurance cap <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/new-report-monetary-policy-without-interest-rate-hikes/\">in my report published last year</a>. This issue deserved a far more profound discussion than I gave it there!<br></p><p>In any case, deposit insurance and the issue of uninsured deposits have jumped into the public consciousness since the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. I gave my first overview of the issue with deposit <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/every-complex-banking-issue-all-at-once-the-failure-of-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-brief-summary-and-five-quick-implications/\">insurance caps</a> a little over two weeks ago. But today, I want to do something a little bit different. Rather than focus on the trials and tribulations of the uninsured depositor, I want to focus on the consequences of the <strong>sophisticated</strong> corporate treasurer or asset manager. One who strategizes <strong>around</strong> the uncertainties of uninsured deposits. <br></p><p>A multitude of voices have claimed that uninsured depositors should not have been saved in this circumstance, because proper “risk management” could have avoided being exposed to such potentially large losses. That may be true, that may not be true. What is certain is that those same “risk management strategies'' have profound consequences for the structure of our financial system that are, to say the least, not unamigiously positive. <br></p><p>Which brings us to Zoltan Pozsar. No figure is more closely associated with the profound consequences of uninsured deposits for the financial system than Pozsar. He gained notoriety as <strong>an expert in the shadow banking system</strong> (don’t worry, we’ll return to what this means in a second). Pozsar was himself a key architect of the government’s crisis response in 2008 — from the vantage point of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. While he was a visiting scholar at the International Monetary Fund in 2011 to 2012 he wrote a series of papers on the big picture causes of shadow banking, particularly on the “demand” or “customer” side. From late 2012 to February 2015 he was a senior adviser to the United States Treasury. <br></p><p>On first glance then, you might have expected Zoltan to have been prolific during this crisis. No possible financial market meltdown illustrates the power of his analysis more than this crisis. If 2008 was a Minsky moment, this was a Pozsar moment (of course, Minsky had a lot to say <a href=\"https://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/palpalchp/978-1-349-10439-0_5f19.htm?ref=crisesnotes.com\">about uninsured deposits too</a>). Yet, Pozsar<strong> has been nowhere to be found. </strong>Why is that? Well, relevant context is that in 2015 Zoltan left his position at the Treasury to become a Managing Director at Credit Suisse where he has written, among other things, dozens of informative <a href=\"https://research-doc.credit-suisse.com/docView?language=ENG&format=PDF&sourceid=em&document_id=1081667671&serialid=O7%2F1RqlxYQEX2ZbbhCZF83ICa7K5bIH5EPt8XIYY3zQ%3D&cspId=null&ref=crisesnotes.com\">“Global Money Notes”</a>. <br></p><p>As readers may be aware, the failure of Silicon Valley Bank led to liquidity strains at Credit Suisse (which has been a bank with fundamental problems for many years now) that ultimately led Swiss regulators to compel <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84406867-0aa9-4d65-9419-2bfa6e7c4001?ref=crisesnotes.com\">UBS to buy Credit Suisse</a>. It is beyond the scope of my piece today to write a full assessment of these events. What is relevant in this context is that Zoltan couldn’t write about uninsured deposits causing wider financial system strains because those strains <strong>targeted his bank, specifically</strong>. Anything he would write would have undesirable consequences <strong>for his own institution</strong>. Stepping back, this is quite funny. The best way I can describe <strong>why</strong> it's funny is with an analogy: Zoltan Pozsar’s employer being taken down because of a run on uninsured deposits is kind of like Issac Newton dying by falling out of an apple tree.<br></p><p>Since Pozsar is out of commission for the foreseeable future, I think today it's worth rereading his work in the context of Silicon Valley Bank. Let’s take a deeper look at why some of us are not so enthused about these “sophisticated” cash management practices. Supposedly these eliminate the negative (as opposed to the “positive”) consequences of uninsured deposits, but do things really work out that way? Pozsar’s work suggests that the original negative consequences (that uninsured depositors may take a loss), are just <strong>replaced by broader negative consequences</strong> in the organization of the broader financial system.<br></p><p>The most important paper from Pozsar related to the issue of deposit insurance is a paper entitled <a href=\"https://im.ft-static.com/content/images/8ae8ad1c-c43a-11e0-ad9a-00144feabdc0.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">“Institutional Cash Pools and the Triffin Dilemma of the U.S. Banking System”</a>. First, some terminology. Pozsar uses the term “institutional cash pools” for those institutions, such as pension funds, university endowments, insurance companies or bank trust departments that invest large monetary sums in order to get a “sufficient” return. Typically, these entities have a fiduciary and/or trustee relationship to others, which provide legal parameters for how these assets should be managed. Economist Hyman Minsky <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1430&context=hm_archive&ref=crisesnotes.com\">used the phrase “money manager capitalism”</a> for the same phenomenon. <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563467.2016.1094045?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Some assessing this development have</a> replaced references to “money” with “asset” i.e. “asset manager capitalism”. This is meant to reflect that only a small percentage of the assets institutional investors invest in are “money” or have a high degree of “moneyness”. For similar reasons, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/new-report-monetary-policy-without-interest-rate-hikes/\">in my work I’ve used the phrase</a> “financial net worth pools”, rather than “cash pools” as Pozsar does.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Whatever terminology you use, the point is that there are a wide set of institutions which manage literally trillions of dollars of assets. Just like you or I do, these institutions have to hold a certain amount of their funds in “cash”, in order to manage their investments and meet outflows. Deposit insurance caps are a problem for this wider network of institutions, because these caps are sized relative to most household “cash balance needs”. By contrast, they are almost laughably tiny compared to the monetary needs of these institutions. This “mismatch” is a gigantic problem. What the financial services part of the financial system ecosystem did ( and does) is create new financial products in an attempt to solve these problems- for a fee. In short, they invented new types of “money”.<br></p><p>Zoltan’s paper zooms in on this phenomenon. Before Zoltan’s work there were large discussions of the “shadow banking system”, but they tended to focus on the incentives that financial institutions had to create “shadow money” in order to hold (seemingly) high yielding assets. Pozsar’s work flips this perspective. Instead he asks, why is there such a large and deep customer base for shadow money? The answer he provides is- deposit insurance caps. It’s worth quoting Pozsar <a href=\"https://im.ft-static.com/content/images/8ae8ad1c-c43a-11e0-ad9a-00144feabdc0.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">at length here</a>:</p><blockquote>As the limits of slicing and spreading growing institutional cash pools in fixed, insured increments across a shrinking number of banks and against binding unsecured exposure limits were reached, institutional cash pools faced two alternatives: <br></blockquote><blockquote>(i)<strong> holding uninsured deposits</strong> and becoming uninsured, unsecured creditors to banks, or <br></blockquote><blockquote>(ii) investing in insured deposit alternatives—that is, safe, short-term and liquid instruments—such as short-term <br></blockquote><blockquote>(ii/a) <strong>government guaranteed instruments</strong> or <br></blockquote><blockquote>(ii/b) a range of privately guaranteed instruments (secured instruments and money funds) issued by the so-called “shadow” banking system. <br></blockquote><blockquote>With only a limited appetite for <strong>direct, unsecured exposures to banks through uninsured deposits</strong>, however, institutional cash pools opted for the second set of alternatives. Relative to the aggregate volume of institutional cash pools, however, there was an insufficient supply of short-term government-guaranteed instruments to serve as insured deposit alternatives [...[ With a shortage of short-term government-guaranteed instruments, institutional cash pools next gravitated—almost by default—toward the other alternative of privately guaranteed instruments<br></blockquote><p>I will return to the issue of <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/we-should-authorize-the-federal-reserve/\">“insufficient supply of short-term government-guaranteed instruments”</a> in another piece. For today, what matters is that the key element of uninsured deposits is that they are “unsecured” i.e. <strong>not collateralized</strong>. This has two issues. 1) you’re less protected against loss because you’re exposed to all of a bank’s potential losses, rather than simply the value of one asset (the collateral). 2) Worse, you have the threat of illiquidity. Even if you will <strong>ultimately</strong> be paid back, the time it takes the FDIC to fully dispose of the bank’s assets can potentially be <strong>quite long</strong>. In the meantime, you have a “receivership certificate” which, to say the least, is not an attractive asset to hold. The attractive feature of secured claims- that is collateralized IOUs- is that in case of default you can sell the collateral- and typically quite quickly. Even the extreme case of taking the exact same loss with shadow money that you would have with uninsured deposits favors shadow money because you realize the loss quickly and have liquid funds on hand rather than an illiquid claim that will take- at the very least- months to resolve itself. At least, in theory<br></p><p>Which leads to the negative consequences part. This search for collateralized shadow monies to replace uncollateralized uninsured deposits is not some harmless, costless process. Indeed the very <strong>term</strong> shadow banking <a href=\"https://www.pimco.com/en-us/insights/economic-and-market-commentary/global-central-bank-focus/the-shadow-banking-system-and-hyman-minskys-economic-journey/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">was coined by Paul McCulley in 2007</a> to describe a set of “non-bank” financial institutions which ultimately themselves experienced a run… A “shadow bank run”, if you will. Recall that the thing that makes today’s shadow money valuable is that “even” in the case of default, and you can sell the underlying collateral quickly and easily. In other words, the collateral is <strong>safe and liquid</strong>. Just as losses (whether unrealized or realized) can cause a run by uninsured depositors, potential losses can cause a run by shadow money holders. Remember 2007 and 2008? Remember a little instrument called a <strong>Mortgage-Backed Security</strong>? It should not surprise you to learn that these were one of the key forms of <strong>safe collateral</strong> which “<strong>collateralized” shadow money</strong>. Oops!</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>That there was a “shadow” bank run is one of the less discussed elements of the financial crisis in popular culture but to those of us obsessed with the structure of the financial system, it's a key element of the whole episode. It’s also important to understand that while loss fears triggered these runs, the key deadly element was the collapse of <strong>liquidity</strong>. Ultimately, the highest rated private mortgage backed securities (AAA) were the principal taken-as-safe collateral for these shadow monies. AAA MBS securities ultimately took only a couple <a href=\"https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/WP_2018-24.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">percentage points of losses on average</a>. Remember that, as I explained <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-there-really-a-looming-bank-collapse/\">at length in 2020</a>, Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) are a different instrument entirely.</p><p></p><p>The point is that ultimately, even the extreme and fraudulent activities which emerged during the 2000s housing boom were not enough to create losses in the safest portion (or <strong>tranche</strong>) of Mortgage Backed Securities. In this sense, the financial engineering <strong>actually worked</strong>. The problem was all the financial byproducts (the lower- especially the lowest- tranches) and the inappropriate <strong>further </strong>use of these financial engineering tools. Again, to learn about this in more detail <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-there-really-a-looming-bank-collapse/\">read my 2020 piece on the topic</a>. Where the financial engineering <strong>completely </strong>failed is in creating an asset that truly had the liquidity of government securities. The losses may have ultimately been small, but there was no way to know that in the moment. That fear made these <strong>assets illiquid</strong>.<br></p><p>You might even remember the terminology that emerged at the time to describe this: <strong>toxic assets</strong>. What the public did not understand at the time is that while fear of losses may have made them toxic, the real issue of toxicity was “liquidity”. The shadow banking system had collapsed as a result of runs which meant the <strong>multi-trillion</strong> dollar system which financed them no longer existed. The only possible solution was the chartered banking system directly financing the holding of AAA mortgage-backed securities (which it was in no position to do) or else the government stepping in. The money creation process which generated liquidity in these securities markets collapsed and only government balance sheets- i.e. government money creation- could fill the void. You know the rest of the story from here.<br></p><p>The larger issue Zoltan Pozsar is highlighting in this paper is that when you look beyond narrow measures of “the money supply”, deposit insurance is providing less and less protection as these financial net worth pools grow and grow. He says this outright in the paper:</p><blockquote>Indeed, if institutional cash pools continue to rely on banks as their credit and liquidity put providers of last resort, the secular rise of <strong>uninsured institutional cash pools</strong> relative to the<strong> size of insured deposits</strong> is going to make the U.S. financial system increasingly <strong>run-prone</strong>, not unlike it <strong>used to be</strong> prior to the creation of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Put another way, the secular rise of cash pools reduces the <strong>effectiveness of deposit insurance in promoting system-stability</strong>, if depository institutions are wired to serve as insurers of last resort for the world’s uninsured dollar liquidity</blockquote><p>Pozsar himself proposes various incremental policy reforms which would limit these issues. He does not suggest getting rid of the deposit insurance cap himself. I briefly touched on the broader range of solutions proposed by a range of thinkers<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/every-complex-banking-issue-all-at-once-the-failure-of-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-brief-summary-and-five-quick-implications/\"> in my piece from earlier this month on Silicon Valley Bank</a>. At some point I will write an entire piece on these solutions, including running through Pozsar’s recommendations in this paper. </p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Regardless of the potential solutions, I think rereading Pozsar illustrates that the “sophisticated cash management” which has been invoked to criticize “unsophisticated” uninsured depositors has a downside. Shadow bank runs are no better than bank runs. Indeed, in some ways they are worse because shadow banks don’t have direct discount window access. When 13(3) is invoked to effectively give them discount window access, they get the benefits of banking powers without the costs (bank regulation). In this sense, I salute “unsophisticated” uninsured depositors. They have been an unheralded defender of financial stability. We don’t need shadow banking to expand further.<br></p><p>Which leads me to one final topic before I leave readers today. If you look carefully at this piece, none of it is about careful monitoring of balance sheets and credit risks because these “financial net worth pools” do not have the benefits of deposit insurance. Instead, this piece has mostly been about <strong>collateral</strong>. In some fundamental sense, institutional investors want collateral because they <strong>don’t</strong> want to do careful credit monitoring. The dream of “market discipline” crashes against a wave of financial engineering in the real world. The Great Financial Crisis involved a lot of complicated factors. One factor it was completely missing was the careful monitoring of credit risks and uncertainties and assurance of borrower <strong>creditworthiness</strong>. As I said in 2020, ideally creditors would like to replace creditworthiness <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/central-bank-collateral-policy-monetarypolicy101/\">with <strong>collateralworthiness</strong></a>. <br></p><p>Leaning <strong>completely</strong> on collateral is the <strong>opposite</strong> of careful monitoring of balance sheets. Asset managers seek out being “fully collateralized” precisely to <strong>limit</strong> the number of actors whose default uncertainties (and overall credit worthiness) they have to assess. <br></p><p>This is clearest in the case of the latest innovation in shadow money- “cash sweep” programs. These programs, which <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/every-complex-banking-issue-all-at-once-the-failure-of-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-brief-summary-and-five-quick-implications/\">I discussed two weeks ago,</a> use financial technology to take your large uninsured deposit and break it up into literally hundreds of insured deposits at various banks. If <strong>every uninsured depositor</strong> used cash sweep type programs, then there would be <strong>no “market discipline” </strong>i.e. uninsured depositors monitoring bank balance sheets. This would be functionally the same as uncapped deposit insurance, except formally uninsured depositors would pay a fee for that service upfront. Under full deposit insurance, banks would instead have lower interest rates on deposits or find some other mechanism to “recoup costs”. As I said in <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/every-complex-banking-issue-all-at-once-the-failure-of-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-brief-summary-and-five-quick-implications/\">that first piece</a> discussing all these issues, these “brokered deposits” products essentially transform uninsured deposits into shadow monies. These shadow monies simply have the unique feature that they emerge from <strong>within</strong> the banking subsidiary, and the collateral is <strong>insured deposits themselves</strong>. <br></p><p>This is a kind of reductio ad absurdum of shadow money which shows that shying away from eliminating deposit insurance won’t provide “liability side discipline”, it will just generate <strong>more shadow banking system instability.</strong> At best, these “cash sweep” innovations (and other similar devices) will effectively create a consumer unfriendly version of unlimited deposit insurance. The difference will be that the pressure for corresponding asset side regulation will dissipate in a fog of complexity.

That kind of analysis is now newly relevant, perhaps even urgent given the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting today, and the press conference Chairman Powell will hold tomorrow. Recall that the FOMC is the committee that determines monetary policy within the Federal Reserve.\n\n\nToday it is widely accepted that the Federal Reserve uses one main tool (interest rates) to affect the economy through the “channel” of “financial conditions'', in order to accomplish its twin goals of high employment and low inflation. Of course, in practice, it’s choice between those two goals when they conflict leans much more heavily towards inflation. In some historical periods, it seemed to be the case that they only cared about inflation. However, that is not what this piece is about. Instead I want to focus on those first two parts: tools and “channels''.\n\n\nBoth these terms, “tools'' and “channels”, are relatively clear and intuitive, but imprecise. In debates over how to operate monetary policy between the 1960s and 1980s, more precise terms emerged in the debates between central bankers and academic economists. The first of these terms is “operational target”. The idea here is that you can state goals, but they don’t have much meaning without a way to accomplish them. An operational target is something you can concretely accomplish which will impact the economy and (presumably) somehow lead to accomplishing your goals. The most obvious operational target is the setting of the federal funds rate, the overnight interest rate chartered banks charge each other to lend funds.\n\n\nWhy is this an “operational” target? It’s because the Federal Reserve has concrete tools it can use to directly set this interest rate while… wait why should anyone care about this interest rate? This is not the interest rate on your credit card, on your mortgage or any other important financial market businesses and households interact with. Furthermore, as economist William Dunkman pointed out in his book Qualitative Credit Control as much as 90 years ago, it’s not even a significant cost for banks (most of the time). Most of the liabilities that “match” the assets banks hold are not federal funds, or discount window borrowing (again, today is a little bit different!). No one outside of the banking system is able to borrow on the Federal Funds market at the Federal Funds rate.\n\n\nSo why does the federal funds rate matter? This brings me to the second term those debates produced: “intermediate target”. An intermediate target was something that you attempted to affect with your operational target in order to accomplish your larger goal(s). Thus, to take the simplest example, other interest rates besides the narrow federal funds rate could be taken as the “intermediate target”. Deposit rates and loan rates may increase because the Federal Funds rate has increased. Interest rates on short maturity securities will change, but so will interest rates on longer maturity securities. Some other financial markets may even set their own interest rates as a “mark up” on the federal funds rate. The key to understanding the difference between an operational target and intermediate targets is that operational targets you have direct control over (or at least you believe you have…) Whereas intermediate targets can be varied, and may not behave exactly in line with operational targets. That is, to be intermediate targets they must be affected by your operational target, but other factors may impact them as well.\n\n\nIt’s beyond the scope of this piece to talk about the Federal Reserve before and during World War Two, so I won’t! In fact, I’m just going to start my story here in the late 1950s for convenience. By this point the Federal Funds market had become a significant market, though the discount rate still mattered (that’s the interest rate on loans at the discount window i.e. for direct borrowing from the Federal Reserve). In fact, from within the Federal Reserve by the mid-1960s it was thought that private actors were overly focused on the discount rate relative to the federal funds rate. But that is a story for another time. What matters for the purposes of my story today is that the Federal Reserve is moving interest rates around to impact financial conditions and thus the broader economy (it's actually more complicated than this, I can only cover so much in one piece!)\n\n\n\n\nYet the Federal Reserve under William McChesney Martin, Federal Reserve chairman from 1951 to 1970, at this point is not thinking in terms of this schema. They don’t clearly think in terms of using an operational target (though they have one) to impact an intermediate target in order to accomplish their goals. In fact, they were frequently pilloried for not having a framework at all. G.L Bach, a now forgotten, but at the time quite well known monetary policy economist, said in a congressional hearing in 1964:\n\nThe Federal Reserve has not made it clear that it has a clear, explicit framework, or rationale, for its monetary policy, specifying the mechanism or steps connecting particular Federal Reserve policy changes with the desired end results. [...] But without firm knowledge of the links connecting Federal Reserve actions with their immediate targets (for example, free reserves or interest rates) and in turn with later goals (for example, the money stock or availability of credit) and with ultimate objectives (employment, output and prices), neither Federal Reserve officials nor the public can be at all sure of the appropriateness of particular policy measures.\n\nThis criticism is valid. In retrospect, looking from the vantage point of the Federal Reserve’s current operating framework, it's easier to see that the Fed’s core operational target was the Federal Funds rate (with some help from the discount rate) and the Fed’s core intermediate target was “financial conditions”. But at the time, especially to the monetary economists of the era, it seemed that the Federal Reserve had a multitude of intermediate targets, and no clear causal connection from one step to another.\n\n\nMartin, who started out as a New York employee of a St. Louis financial firm in the late 1920s and through much of the Great Depression, worked his way up to being president of the New York Stock exchange in a peculiar set of circumstances. After the war he became the first head of the Import-Export Bank and then a deputy treasury official. The point is, he came to the Federal Reserve with a wealth of practical financial market experience. That experience made a focus on financial conditions quite natural. He had done graduate study in economics at Columbia University, but he focused on practical study of the New York Stock Exchange. He had good reasons to make policy the way he did, but he couldn’t articulate them in ways that satisfied economists and the qualitative, intuitive knowledge he was relying on is not something that can be easily judged from the outside.\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nOf course, the other element here is that in the 1950s and 1960s there was a belief that “optimal control” over the economy was both possible and desirable. Academic economists were not going to tolerate the Federal Reserve’s, or Martin’s, vagueness in such an intellectual environment for long.\n\n\nNaturally, these academic economists were not simply criticizing the Federal Reserve about process issues. They had their own views on what the Federal Reserve’s operational and intermediate targets should be. G.L. Bach may be forgotten now, but one of the other economists at that hearing is more well known today: Allan Meltzer. Professor Meltzer was a well known monetarist, even going so far as to start a “Shadow Federal Open Market Committee” with some other economists to provide a “monetarist alternative” to Federal Reserve actions in 1973. Thus, greatly improving the Federal Reserve’s process was tied to making the Federal Reserve focus more directly on the “money supply” and to use money supply measures as a target.  Monetaristesque ideas also appealed within the Federal Reserve and in congress for more basic issues of government accountability. That is, a quantitative target was something concrete and understandable and you could check whether the Federal Reserve hit its target or not. Financial conditions, especially as the 1950s and 1960s Federal Reserve discussed them, had a level of vagueness which made quantitative oversight quite difficult.\n\n\nThere is also the matter of the accountability of the New York Federal Reserve’s trading desk to the rest of the Federal Reserve, let alone Congress. It is difficult to think about or understand now, but the “desk” had quite an amazing amount of discretion up until (roughly) 30 years ago. Even though the Federal Reserve was effectively targeting interest rates in the 1960s, they did not announce any interest rate target changes at FOMC meetings which then had to be strictly followed until the next meeting. Instead, the FOMC provided “guidelines” to trading desks, ranges in which the federal funds rate can vary and then provided guidance for how purchase and sale policy should adjust relative to various “money market conditions”. In other words, the NYFRB trading desk had discretion to move interest rates up and down depending on what was going on with the Federal Reserve’s intermediate targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be clearer now why so many, including within the Federal Reserve, were so concerned! Without a quantitative and “objective” single intermediate target, the trading desk was being given an astounding level of discretion to effectively decide monetary policy on its own. Thus some elements of monetarism appealed to Federal Reserve insiders, because it was believed that providing an intermediate money supply target for the trading desk would constrain its discretion. Of course, this was not satisfying to true U.S. monetarists. This is a point I will return to.\n\n\nThus, now the Federal Reserve was using interest rates as an operational target in an attempt to influence the broader money supply as an intermediate target in order to accomplish its longer term goals. Interestingly, Milton Friedman was excited for Arthur Burns to become Federal Reserve chairman in 1970, precisely because he believed that Burns would focus much more on the money supply. Friedman’s interesting initial views of Burns, and the Federal Reserve as a whole in late 1969 is something I’m planning on writing about more in coming months (subscribers will know about my passion for Burns as a much-misunderstood figure in the history of monetary policy). Anyway, Friedman was not wrong about Burns. He did bring the money supply as an intermediate target for the Federal Reserve into much greater prominence. You can imagine however, that the 1970s inflation leads monetarists to downgrade simply “looking” at money supply, or using it as an intermediate target. For the rest of the world, Burns was a hawk. For monetarists, Burns was an inflationist because he was not using the money supply as an operational target. I wrote about this last fall.\n\n\n\n\nThis brings us to the Volcker era and the “Volcker shock”. I also wrote about this exact issue last fall so I will not go into a tremendous amount of detail or substantiate what I say here very much. If you want the details and the evidence, read my piece on this topic. For now, it's sufficive to say that what Volcker did was greatly expand the range over which the Federal Funds rate could fluctuate. This both gave the trading desk greater discretion and “hid'' what their interest rate policy was. They did not announce the bands over which the Federal Funds rate was varying. At the same time, they announced what seemed like operational money supply targets.\n\nSubscribe\n\nThis was initially very exciting for monetarists because initially it was seen as the Federal Reserve “finally” adopting a full money supply targeting system. They, however, quickly got disillusioned. The Federal Reserve doesn’t implement policy in a way that they thought was necessary to “truly” control the money supply from operational target, through to intermediate target, and from there the economy as a whole. They were right, of course. But the reason the Federal Reserve didn’t do things their way is that it has always been simply impossible. Pretending that they were possible was politically convenient for the Federal Reserve, but was never going to shift reality.\n\n\nThis experiment with “practical monetarism”, the euphemism insiders used to discuss advertising policy as monetarist while operationally doing what is possible, was not successful at monetarism. However, it was successful at accomplishing the Federal Reserve’s goals while avoiding the political pressure that would have come with announced operational interest rate targets. On the other hand, this system was also convoluted and difficult to manage. Pretending to do monetarism is extremely hard and confusing work. The FOMC meeting transcripts at this time are filled with Federal Reserve decision-makers professing their utter confusion at what proposals mean and what changes to their operational policy practically meant. They constantly tinkered with their policy to get it right. Even beyond the operational target, confusing things were happening with the money supply data which made the money supply not useful as even an intermediate target.\n\nWhich brings us to Greenspan. During his 19 year reign, the Federal Reserve moved back to interest rate targeting. Not only that, however, they begin holding press conferences every FOMC meeting to announce their new operational interest rate target. In many ways the fundamental institutional structure and public communication apparatus of the Federal Reserve emerged under Alan Greenspan (under intense congressional pressure, especially by congressman Henry Gonzalez). In this world, the trading desk had little to no discretion on the Federal Funds rate. This was interest rate targeting, yes, but more explicit and more straightforward than it had ever been.\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nHowever, while the operational target was at the height of clarity, the same cannot be said for intermediate targets. With the failure of broad money supply measures as an intermediate target, the Federal Reserve was back to looking at a raft of indicators. Unwilling to commit to anything, I think the best way to describe the Federal Reserve’s intermediate target at this time is “constructive ambiguity”. This was the infamous Greenspan phrase to refer to him saying vague and incomprehensible things, which could be interpreted in any number of ways. It may be apocryphal, but the anecdote that Greenspan told a congressman that “if you have understood me, I have misspoken” does effectively capture what the Greenspan era was like.\n\n\nWhich brings us to the modern era and today’s FOMC meeting. Nowadays, it is much more clearly stated that, effectively, the Federal Reserve’s intermediate target is “financial conditions”. What’s funny about this is, as you can see, this effectively returns us back to where we started. The operational target is interest rates, and the intermediate target is financial conditions. Monetary policy essentially went on a long, strange trip throughout many different intellectual trends and policy difficulties to end up back where we started. Of course, the process is far better. The Federal Reserve typically, with a few notable recent failures, communicates about what future policy is, and what they are doing with their operational target. The NYFRB trading desk has no discretion over setting the operational target. Process improvements aside, the fundamental policy framework is now the same.\n\n\n\nSome readers may object that while on the surface it appears identical to the pre-1964 Martin Fed, actually today’s notion of financial conditions is more precise and sophisticated. Now we have financial conditions indices! In some ways, this is true. We know far more about what financial stresses look like and we have far, far more data. In other ways, this is not true. If you look under the hood of those financial condition indices, they seem just as “atheoretical” and just as much of a “grabbag” as the mixture of indicators the Martin Federal Reserve relied on. Take the National Financial Conditions Index produced by the Chicago Federal Reserve. It looks nice and pretty. In reality, it is 105 different measures that are more or less arbitrarily weighted. These are put into the same indicator without any analysis, or clear indication that many of the “indicators” are quite different. The majority are quantitative, but there are also many qualitative data sources jammed into the index!\n\n\nSo do we have more data today? Clearly! Is it better? I’m not so convinced. In short, theoretical coherence has not yet come for financial conditions, at least not at the Federal Reserve.\n\nSubscribe\n\nThe other issue is that it is not clear how seriously the Federal Reserve takes financial conditions as an intermediate target. As Skanda Amarnath & Preston Mui over at Employ America said on Saturday, the recent events with Silicon Valley Bank and the policy response have tightened financial conditions. There is far greater financial uncertainty at this moment, while banks tighten lending standards for a variety of reasons. If you take the intermediate target concept seriously, interest rate increases are less “necessary” to decrease demand in the economy. These factors will already decrease demand! Continuing to hike would suggest they don’t really trust their own professed focus on financial conditions. It’s only tightening financial conditions if it comes from the Eccles Building in Washington DC… otherwise it's just sparkling financial instability.\n\n\nThat means a Federal Reserve decision to increase interest rates today would not simply be a mistake. It would bring up far more fundamental questions about the Federal Reserve’s operating framework. So at this point, I’m very interested in seeing what they will do.\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version\n\n","html":"<p></p><p>Before Silicon Valley Bank failed last week, I was considering writing a post examining the Federal Reserve’s policy framework in the context of the last sixty years of monetary policy’s history. That kind of analysis is now newly relevant, perhaps even urgent given the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting today, and the press conference Chairman Powell will hold tomorrow. Recall that the FOMC is the committee that determines monetary policy within the Federal Reserve. <br></p><p>Today it is widely accepted that the Federal Reserve uses one main tool (interest rates) to affect the economy through the “channel” of “financial conditions'', in order to accomplish its twin goals of high employment and low inflation. Of course, in practice, it’s choice between those two goals when they conflict leans <strong>much more heavily towards inflation. </strong>In some historical periods, it seemed to be the case that they <strong>only</strong> cared about inflation. However, that is not what this piece is about. Instead I want to focus on those first two parts: tools and “channels''. <br></p><p>Both these terms, “tools'' and “channels”, are relatively clear and intuitive,<strong> but imprecise.</strong> In debates over how to operate monetary policy between the 1960s and 1980s, more precise terms emerged in the debates between central bankers and academic economists. The first of these terms is “operational target”. The idea here is that you can state goals, but<strong> they don’t have much meaning without a way to accomplish them. </strong>An operational target is something you can concretely accomplish which will impact the economy and (presumably) somehow lead to accomplishing your goals. The most obvious operational target is the setting of the federal funds rate, the overnight interest rate chartered banks charge each other to lend funds. <br></p><p>Why is this an “operational” target? It’s because the Federal Reserve has concrete tools it can use to directly set this interest rate while… wait why should anyone care about this interest rate? This is not the interest rate on your credit card, on your mortgage or any other important financial market businesses and households interact with. Furthermore, as economist William Dunkman pointed out in his book <a href=\"https://files.crisesnotes.com/dunkman1933.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><em>Qualitative Credit Control</em> as much as <strong>90 years ago</strong></a>, it’s not even a significant cost for banks (most of the time). Most of the liabilities that “match” the assets banks hold are not federal funds, or discount window borrowing (again, today is a little bit different!). No one outside of the banking system is able to borrow on the Federal Funds market at the Federal Funds rate.<br></p><p>So why does the federal funds rate matter? This brings me to the second term those debates produced: “intermediate target”. An intermediate target was something that you attempted to affect with your <strong>operational target</strong> in order to accomplish your larger goal(s). Thus, to take the simplest example, other interest rates besides the narrow federal funds rate could be taken as the “intermediate target”. Deposit rates and loan rates may increase because the Federal Funds rate has increased. Interest rates on short maturity securities will change, but so will interest rates on longer maturity securities. Some other financial markets may even set their own interest rates as a “mark up” on the federal funds rate. The key to understanding the difference between an operational target and intermediate targets is that operational targets you have direct control over (or at least you believe you have…) Whereas intermediate targets can be varied, and may not behave exactly in line with operational targets. That is, to be intermediate targets they must be <strong>affected</strong> by your operational target, but other factors may impact them as well. <br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/A8GKkWxdYLNC8OGjXMtC_bCUGLlGqdfe5ADbG-fEj6z-TgqnL1X3d5159FieFSfRaR8G8tDo44c3Au9vZ-fEYcF29YxcZI3lTG-p5j-IhONwMa52WCeMBBZqtyNvl8T8rOF2HARbZi_7cLwvVBTZETE\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"223\"></figure><p>It’s beyond the scope of this piece to talk about the Federal Reserve before and during World War Two, so I won’t!

Now we have financial conditions indices! In some ways, this is true. <strong>We know far more about what financial stresses look like</strong> and we have far, far more data. In other ways, this is not true. If you look under the hood of those financial condition indices, <strong>they seem just as “atheoretical” and just as much of a “grabbag”</strong> as the mixture of indicators the Martin Federal Reserve relied on. Take <a href=\"https://www.chicagofed.org/research/data/nfci/about?ref=crisesnotes.com\">the National Financial Conditions Index</a> produced by the Chicago Federal Reserve. It looks nice and pretty. In reality, it is <a href=\"https://www.chicagofed.org/-/media/publications/nfci/nfci-indicators-list-pdf.pdf?sc_lang=en&hash=2BAA83FA5155FFEBDF4A3448814090C8&ref=crisesnotes.com\">105 different measures that are more or less arbitrarily weighted</a>. These are put into the same indicator without any analysis, or clear indication that many of the “indicators” are quite different. The majority are quantitative, but there are also many qualitative data sources jammed into the index! <br></p><p>So do we have <strong>more </strong>data today? Clearly! Is it <strong>better? </strong>I’m not so convinced.

As Skanda Amarnath &amp; Preston Mui over at Employ America said <a href=\"https://www.employamerica.org/blog/mar-fomc-preview-will-the-fed-first-pause-look-and-listen-2/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">on Saturday</a>, the recent events with Silicon Valley Bank and the policy response have tightened financial conditions. There is far greater financial uncertainty at this moment, while banks <strong>tighten lending standards for a variety of reasons</strong>. If you take the intermediate target concept seriously, interest rate increases are less “necessary” to decrease demand in the economy. <strong>These factors will already decrease demand!</strong> Continuing to hike would suggest they don’t really trust their own professed focus on financial conditions. It’s only tightening financial conditions if it comes from the Eccles Building in Washington DC… <strong>otherwise it's just sparkling financial instability.</strong> </p><p><br>That means a Federal Reserve decision to increase interest rates today would <strong>not simply be a mistake. </strong>It would bring up far more fundamental questions about the Federal Reserve’s operating framework.

I am enormously proud (and still bewildered) by how much I was able to subsequently write for those first four months. I covered nearly every complicated step of what happened.\n\n\nMore to the point, I'm still shocked by how overwhelming the audience response was — culminating in a globally translated viral profile in Bloomberg Businessweek. Still, even three years later, I am not used to how much my status has changed personally — and how many people now take my opinion very seriously. I can’t ever express how grateful I am to all my readers. You have all changed my life forever.\n\n\nIt has felt appropriate then, as “financial” events have recently “sped up”, to be publishing pieces at a faster pace. This is my third piece this week, coming on this deeply special third anniversary. Before Silicon Valley Bank failed, I was putting the finishing touches on a book proposal for a book on the Federal Reserve (and I will be officially announcing sometime in the coming weeks.) I’m so excited for that next phase in my writing, and in this newsletter. To those paid subscribers who have shown me patience, I also am extraordinarily grateful.\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nFinally, I want to say something about the concept of crises. Getting success for covering them can sometimes be a strange feeling. I am, in a sense, “countercylical”. My peaks are everyone else’s troughs. Put simply, when global economic conditions get rough, I get more attention. As much as I’m grateful for the success my readers have brought me in so many different ways, it would be nice to make this newsletter irrelevant by moving past crises, and solving our major socioeconomic problems. The Coronavirus pandemic is not over, even if the depression has been for sometime. I hope someday I’m rendered completely obsolete as a newsletter writer, and I will be happy to move ahead to something else. In the meantime however, enjoy this piece about an especially complex set of arrangements that lie behind the current crisis response. Subscribe here if you want to support these pieces being free for the next few weeks.\n\n\nI try my best to provide clear and simple explanations. I was really gratified to hear from many readers who read my overall guide to what happened to Silicon Valley Bank. They reached out to tell me that they found it to be a simple and clear explanation of quite complicated material. Sometimes however, there is no clear and simple explanation that will make what is confusing easily and fully understandable. In today’s case, that is true because what we are going to discuss simply is convoluted and confusing (even to me!) I became globally known in part for explaining the very many accounting gimmicks which lay behind the Federal Reserve’s crisis facilities. Today’s piece is a return to that same subject, but now in overdrive.\n\nAs a result, even though I am going to devote many hundreds of words to make what I am talking about understandable and easy to follow, I am still going to sound a little bit like Charlie from It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia explaining how there is no Pepe Sylvia.\n\n\nWhen readers think of the Depository Insurance Fund, I am sure an image pops in their mind. They are imagining some bank account somewhere filled with funds, where insurance claims are paid out of and “premiums” by banks flow in. The issue with this image is, that unless you are one of a handful of people obsessed with financial system details, you aren’t thinking about the larger institutional issues involved. To make my point clear, let's ask a simple question, where is that bank account? Is it with a… bank? Are those deposits… uninsured? If they are insured… who is insuring them? Where do they keep the funds to insure the deposits, which are meant to insure all the other deposits? Is there a depositor insurance fund for the depositor insurance fund?? Who insures that fund??\n\n\nAs should be obvious by now, this is something of an infinite regress problem. Of course, none of this is actually at issue because the FDIC does not have an account with any chartered bank or hold private financial assets. Instead, like social security, it has an account — really an accounting entry — with the United States Treasury. These accounts are, confusingly, called “non-marketable treasury securities''. When the FDIC needs to “draw down” the Depositor Insurance Fund, what is really happening is this “non-marketable treasury security” account gets marked down. At that point, the treasury sends a payment from its checking account at the Federal Reserve, called the Treasury General Account.\n\n\nThus, when you consolidate the Federal Government (even if you wrongly exclude the Federal Reserve), outflows to cover deposits from the FDIC are always a use of public money. Those non-marketable treasury securities are just intragovernmental accounting tools used to authorize the payments (dare I say gimmicks?) but at the consolidated level, all the non-marketable treasury securities in the DIF — or the social security trust fund for that matter — disappear. All there is is public money flowing out, and public money flowing in. That means this narrative about now “taxpayer money” (a nonsense phrase) was “not involved” in supporting uninsured depositors is nonsense.\n\n\nReally, funds flowing out of the Treasury’s checking account are not the only form of public money involved. There is also Federal Reserve discount window lending to the new banks the FDIC has set up. As I discussed in my piece on Tuesday, the “discount window” is just a term for the part of the Federal Reserve where banks can get loans from the Federal Reserve. I will write more about the full scope of the Federal Reserve’s discount window lending this past week another time. For now it suffices to briefly say the scope of this discount window lending is absolutely massive. These loans are altogether 295.6 billion dollars, a truly unprecedented amount. For context, that is substantially more discount window borrowing than happened during the 2008 financial crisis. The new Bank Term Lending Program had a little under 12 billion dollars of lending. There is also apparently more than 10 billion dollars outstanding from the Payroll Protection Program Liquidity Facility (a silly program NotC discussed way back in April 2020). Thus, all together the Federal Reserve has 318 billion dollars of loans to chartered banks outstanding. Roughly 300 billion of those dollars went out this past week.\n\n\nThis brings us back to the Depository Insurance Fund. 142 billion dollars of those discount window loans went to the new banks the FDIC has created to take on Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank’s assets. There is a specific subsection of the “discount window” part of the Federal Reserve Act which governs lending to FDIC owned institutions entitled 10(b)(3). This is important for a few reasons. One, it clarifies that this is discount window lending (a point which a number of news outlets have incorrectly reported over the past four days.) Second, it makes clear that the Bank Term Funding Facility was not created to support these institutions. Instead, they were created to support other chartered banks, which may be having liquidity issues. This is an interesting little fact in and of itself.\n\n\nLooking at such a large amount —  142 billion dollars! —  the question arises what role do those non-marketable treasuries in the DIF even play at all? Don’t these discount window loans “cover” those deposits? In some sense, that is true. In a few others, it is not. For one thing, the timing between a discount window loan and the funds depositors setting up accounts at other banks need right away might not match up exactly. I’ll return to this issue in a second. More fundamentally, it must be remembered that at the end of the day, the FDIC is dealing with primarily a capital issue, not a liquidity issue. After all, if deposit insurance were simply a matter of liquidity then the Federal Reserve could handle it all! In other words, the issue is not making payments. Instead it is making up losses to increase the net worth of this new bridge bank.\n\n\nRecall for a minute how things worked before deposit insurance, and also how things worked for uninsured depositors, under the least-cost rule. The bank would enter receivership, and payments would instantly stop flowing out the door. The reason is payments tend to be, well, 100% of what’s owed. (At least in one specified monthly payment or a depositor outflow). But there are not enough assets to liquidate to cover every creditor at 100% (or at least, that is not clear yet). What that means in practical terms is that every creditor who receives 100% of what they are owed (either in full or in one payment) means every other creditor gets a smaller percentage. Instead, different types of creditors have different priorities in bankruptcy.\n\n\nIn simple terms: different types of creditors are put in either the front, back or middle of the line.\n\n\nWhat deposit insurance is doing is injecting assets into the bank in order to increase its net worth and cover, at the very least, all the insured depositors. As we’re seeing this week they are covering the uninsured depositors as well. It might end up being the case that there are enough assets to cover the insured and uninsured depositors. Then it would just be the bondholders and stockholders who were wiped out. There might even be enough to cover some of the bondholders. As I pointed out on Thursday, ironically the response to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank could possibly change interest rate policy enough to greatly improve the value of their securities. That would make far more creditors whole. In that case, there would be no ultimate impact on the Depository Insurance Fund’s accounting entry with the treasury.\n\n\nWhich brings us all the way back to where we started. Roughly 40 billion dollars was reported to have both “flowed in” and “flowed out” of the FDIC and thus the Treasury’s checking account. How could that be, if the FDIC’s banks got 142 billion dollars of loans from the Federal Reserve? The difference, I think, is that initially 40 billion dollars flowed out of the treasury’s checking account to cover depositor outflow before the discount window loans were arranged. Then, once those loans were made, 40 billion dollars flowed back. Thus the Federal Reserve filled up the Treasury’s checking account as a result of a direct loan to a corporation another agency of the federal government owns. In simpler terms, the Federal Reserve made a loan to the rest of the Federal Government. This is a great reminder that there are only restrictions on the Federal Reserve directly lending to the Treasury.\n\n\nThis still leaves us with the gap between the size of the discount window loans and how much was put into the treasury’s bank account. It’s hard to know exactly what’s going on without exact data on the balance sheets of the individual FDIC-owned banks, but I do think I have a rough idea of what happened. Recall that these FDIC-owned banks have their own checking account with the Federal Reserve, just like all other chartered banks which are members of the Federal Reserve. Also recall what these discount window loans were for in the first place — depositor outflow. These payment outflows needed to be covered —  and they were covered with discount window loans.\n\n\nThus it seems to me that the difference between these two amounts —  what was returned to the treasury’s checking account and the size of the discount window loans —  is a maximum estimate of how much deposit outflow there was. That would mean 100 billion dollars.\n\n\nNow, these banks could simply have more settlement balances than they started out with before the discount window loans. However, given that before the FDIC took over Silicon Valley Bank it had 42 billion dollars in (attempted) depositor outflow in a single day, I am inclined to think that 100 billion dollars is a good estimate for how much payment outflow Signature Bridge Bank and Silicon Valley Bridge Bank experienced this week. (Naturally that provisional guesstimate is subject to revision, once we get actual data.)\n\nSubscribe\n\nWe’ve gone on a journey so far in this piece, and I thank readers for their patience. This brings us to the “debt ceiling”, which motivated this entire piece in the first place. A number of people have expressed concern that covering uninsured depositors will impact the “x” date —  the date that the debt ceiling fully binds. At that point, the treasury has to either default, unconstitutionally raise taxes, or cut spending…Or, well, mint the coin.\n\n\nI actually wrote two pieces about the debt ceiling, minting a trillion dollar coin and the Federal Reserve’s role as the government’s banker earlier this year. Sadly, I forgot to promote them over this newsletter (oops!) Nevertheless, those two pieces caused quite a stir, so I promise this isn’t the last you’ll hear about trillion dollar coins on NotC!\n\n\nAll that said, this commonplace concern about this FDIC action moving the “x” date forward is unfounded. But it’s unfounded for an interesting reason. The debt ceiling counts these gimmicky non-marketable treasuries towards the debt ceiling. That’s true even though they have no financial or monetary impact on the economy. This is a case where doing legal analysis requires that you not even consolidate different government agencies together. Thus, whenever the Depository Insurance Fund is marked down, the treasury has that much more room to issue more treasury securities.\n\nOf course, it turns out that even that was not necessary because the money that flowed out of the treasury’s checking account was refilled right back because of, essentially, a Federal Reserve loan to the federal government. So one form of public money made it so that we didn’t need a different form of public money. The “x” date will only be affected if there is more than 100 billion dollars of losses, and the depository insurance fund is marked as negative. In that case, they borrow from the treasury! This, of course, is silly. Different accounting gimmicks could make it possible to continue to borrow from the Federal Reserve.\n\n\nEven sillier, this is not a practical concern, given the timing up the upcoming debt ceiling fight. Recall that resolving a bridge bank and finding a private buyer takes time. The “x” date is estimated to be roughly in June, perhaps July. Even in the unlikely event losses got that massive- perhaps because of more bank failures — the FDIC could simply move slowly. Since the Federal Reserve is covering all the payment outflows with discount window loans, the depositor outflow can be fully covered without the treasury sending any payments. Even if the balance held by the Depositor Insurance Fund was dwarfed by bank losses, the FDIC could simply not finish resolving that situation and “realizing” those losses so that they weren’t forced to draw on their “line of credit”. This is the case even though it's still public money going out the door. It also looks remarkably similar to Silicon Valley Bank’s plan to not realize losses. In that case, it was so that the bank wouldn’t fail. In this case, it would be motivated by not hitting the debt ceiling.\n\n\nIn other words, this part of high finance relies heavily on using one accounting gimmick, so that they don’t trip over another, which would trip over another. This is quite the game of avoid the dominoes.\n\n\nLet’s step back for a moment. It’s when you take the full view of all this complexity that I really begin to feel like Charlie from Always Sunny. We have an accounting gimmick called the Depository Insurance Fund to legally authorize a certain amount of payments from the treasury to FDIC owned banks, and thus depositors. That accounting gimmick, in turn, technically owns another accounting gimmick which is called a “non-marketable treasury security”. But because that accounting gimmick has “treasury security” in the name, it counts against the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling, of course, is another accounting gimmick. The fact that “non-marketable treasuries'' are called treasuries makes it so that marking down the balance of the Depositor Insurance Fund doesn’t impact the debt ceiling. But it will arbitrarily start if that balance is marked as negative. But only because there isn’t an accounting gimmick to facilitate borrowing from the Federal Reserve, rather than the treasury — if you desire to realize losses sooner rather than later.\n\nSo far so simple, right?\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve in practice makes sure that you don’t have to realize those losses until you are good and ready! They simply lend these FDIC owned banks whatever they need, and any excess funds fill up the treasury’s checking account and mark up the Depositor Insurance Fund. All of this could be simplified with much simpler accounting gimmicks that are far more understandable to the public. Of course, more understandable accounting gimmicks might be seen as politically inconvenient.\n\nIndeed, we know they are! Compare this dizzying complexity and Rube Goldbergesque series of accounting gimmicks and creaky set of arrangements to the relative simplicity of depositing a coin at the Federal Reserve. Depositing a coin with a big face value — say one trillion dollars — might seem silly, but it takes a sentence to describe. The Federal Reserve is the Treasury’s banker. “The Treasury deposited a coin worth a lot of money in its banking account” is something a five year old could understand — even if they would also laugh. When you really understand the accounting gimmicks that propped up the Federal Reserve’s coronavirus crisis response, but also all these other areas of public finance, it is absolutely astounding and galling that a coin which will avert government default is where secretary of the treasury Janet Yellen draws the line and dismissively declares a potential solution to a huge problem an  “accounting gimmick”.\n\n\nMore fundamentally, it’s completely silly that deposits — which remember are bank created money and are seen as money by their owners — are technically and “ultimately” covered by issuing treasury securities. Why? If there’s any place that direct monetary finance makes sense, it's in making sure money is money. Give these FDIC owned banks a platinum coin, and tell them to deposit it at the Federal Reserve. I think this is a perfectly reasonable compromise. Give me a call Secretary Yellen — I’m willing to negotiate.\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><em>Normally I do not release pieces on Saturdays or Sundays.

I was really gratified to hear from many readers who read <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/every-complex-banking-issue-all-at-once-the-failure-of-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-brief-summary-and-five-quick-implications/\">my overall guide to what happened to Silicon Valley Bank</a>. They reached out to tell me that they found it to be a simple and clear explanation of quite complicated material. Sometimes however, there is no clear and simple explanation that will make what is confusing easily and fully understandable. In today’s case, that is true because what we are going to discuss simply <em>is</em> convoluted and confusing (even to me!) I became globally known in part for explaining the very many accounting gimmicks which lay behind the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-federal/\">Federal Reserve’s crisis facilities</a>. Today’s piece is a return to that same subject, <strong>but now in overdrive.</strong><br><br>As a result, even though I am going to devote many hundreds of words to make what I am talking about understandable and easy to follow, I am still going to sound a little bit like Charlie from <em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> explaining how there is no Pepe Sylvia. <br></p><p>When readers think of the Depository Insurance Fund, I am sure an image pops in their mind. They are imagining some bank account somewhere filled with funds, where insurance claims are paid out of and “premiums” by banks flow in. The issue with this image is, that unless you are one of a handful of people obsessed with financial system details, <strong>you aren’t thinking about the larger institutional issues involved. </strong>To make my point clear, let's ask a simple question, where is that bank account? Is it with a… bank? Are those deposits… uninsured? If they are insured… who is insuring them? Where do they keep the funds to insure the deposits, which are meant to insure all the other deposits? Is there a depositor insurance fund <strong>for</strong> the depositor insurance fund?? Who insures <strong>that</strong> fund??<br></p><p>As should be obvious by now, this is something of an infinite regress problem. Of course, none of this is <strong>actually</strong> at issue because the FDIC does not have an account with any chartered bank or hold private financial assets. Instead, like social security, it has an account — really an accounting entry — with the United States Treasury. These accounts are, confusingly, called “non-marketable treasury securities''. When the FDIC needs to “draw down” the Depositor Insurance Fund, what is really happening is this “non-marketable treasury security” account gets marked down. At that point, the treasury sends a payment from its checking account at the Federal Reserve, called the Treasury General Account.<br></p><p>Thus, when you <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-government-always-money/\">consolidate the Federal Government</a> (<strong>even</strong> <strong>if</strong> you wrongly exclude the Federal Reserve), outflows to cover deposits from the FDIC are <em>always</em> a use of public money. Those non-marketable treasury securities are just intragovernmental accounting tools used to authorize the payments (dare I say gimmicks?) but at the consolidated level, all the non-marketable treasury securities in the DIF — or the social security trust fund for that matter — disappear. All there is is public money flowing out, and public money flowing in. That means this narrative about now “taxpayer money” <a href=\"https://splinternews.com/the-dangerous-myth-of-taxpayer-money-1819658902?ref=crisesnotes.com\">(a nonsense phrase</a>) was “not involved” in supporting <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-government-always-money/\">uninsured depositors is nonsense</a>. <br></p><p>Really, funds flowing out of the Treasury’s checking account are not the only form of public money involved. There is also Federal Reserve discount window lending to the new banks the FDIC has set up. As I discussed <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/every-complex-banking-issue-all-at-once-the-failure-of-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-brief-summary-and-five-quick-implications/\">in my piece on Tuesday</a>, the “discount window” is just a term for the part of the Federal Reserve where banks can get loans from the Federal Reserve. I will write more about the full scope of the Federal Reserve’s discount window lending this past week another time. For now it suffices to briefly say<strong> the scope of this discount window lending is absolutely massive. </strong>These loans are <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20230316/\">altogether 295.6 billion dollars</a>, a truly unprecedented amount. For context, that is substantially more discount window borrowing than happened during the 2008 financial crisis. The new Bank Term Lending Program had a little under 12 billion dollars of lending. There is also apparently more than 10 billion dollars outstanding from the Payroll Protection Program Liquidity Facility (a silly program <em>NotC </em><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-reserves-coronavirus-f6a/\">discussed way back in April 2020</a>). Thus, all together the Federal Reserve has<strong> 318 billion dollars of loans to chartered banks outstanding.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.apricitas.io/p/the-feds-300b-emergency-response?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Roughly 300 billion</a> of those dollars went out <em>this past week</em>.<br></p><p>This brings us back to the Depository Insurance Fund. 142 billion dollars of those discount window loans went to the new banks the FDIC has created to take on Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank’s assets. There is a specific subsection of the “discount window” part of the Federal Reserve Act which governs lending to FDIC owned <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section10b.htm\">institutions entitled 10(b)(3)</a>. This is important for a few reasons. One, it clarifies that this <em>is</em> discount window lending (a point which a number of news outlets have incorrectly reported over the past four days.) Second, it makes clear that the Bank Term Funding Facility was not created to support these institutions. Instead, they were created to support <strong>other chartered banks,</strong> which may be having liquidity issues. This is an interesting little fact in and of itself.<br></p><p>Looking at such a large amount —  142 <strong>billion</strong> dollars! —  the question arises what role do those non-marketable treasuries in the DIF even play at all? Don’t these discount window loans “cover” those deposits? In some sense, that is true. In a few others, it is not. For one thing, the timing between a discount window loan and the funds depositors setting up accounts at other banks need right away <strong>might not match up exactly.</strong> I’ll return to this issue in a second. More fundamentally, it must be remembered that at the end of the day, the FDIC is dealing with primarily a <strong>capital</strong> issue, not a liquidity issue. After all, if deposit insurance were simply a matter of liquidity then the Federal Reserve could handle it all! In other words, the issue is not making payments. Instead it is making up <em>losses</em> to increase the net worth of this new bridge bank. <br></p><p>Recall for a minute how things worked before deposit insurance, and also how things worked for uninsured depositors, under <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/every-complex-banking-issue-all-at-once-the-failure-of-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-brief-summary-and-five-quick-implications/\">the least-cost rule</a>. The bank would enter receivership, and payments would instantly stop flowing out the door. The reason is payments tend to be, well, <strong>100% of what’s owed. </strong>(At least in one specified monthly payment or a depositor outflow). But there are not enough assets to liquidate to cover every creditor at 100% (or at least, that is not clear yet). What that means in practical terms is that every creditor who receives 100% of what they are owed (either in full or in one payment) means every other creditor gets a smaller percentage. Instead, different types of creditors have different <strong>priorities</strong> in bankruptcy. <br></p><p>In simple terms: <strong>different types of creditors are put in either the front, back or middle of the line. </strong><br></p><p>What deposit insurance is doing is injecting assets into the bank in order to increase its net worth and cover, at the very least, all the <strong>insured</strong> depositors. As we’re seeing this week they are covering the <strong>uninsured</strong> depositors as well. It might end up being the case that there are enough assets to cover the insured and uninsured depositors. Then it would just be the bondholders and stockholders who were wiped out. There might even be enough to cover some of the bondholders. As I <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/whats-going-on-with-treasuries-silicon-valley-bank-and-the-incoherence-of-the-federal-reserves-lack-of-an-interest-rate-policy-this-week/\">pointed out on Thursday</a>, ironically the response to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank could possibly change interest rate policy enough to greatly improve the value of their securities. That would make far more creditors whole. In that case, there would be <strong>no ultimate impact </strong>on the Depository Insurance Fund’s accounting entry with the treasury.<br></p><p>Which brings us all the way back to where we started. Roughly 40 billion dollars <a href=\"https://fsapps.fiscal.treasury.gov/dts/files/23031600.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">was reported</a> to have both “flowed in” and “flowed out” of the FDIC and thus the Treasury’s checking account. How could that be, if the FDIC’s banks got 142 billion dollars of loans from the Federal Reserve? The difference, I think, is that initially 40 billion dollars flowed out of the treasury’s checking account to cover depositor outflow before the discount window loans were arranged. Then, once those loans were made, 40 billion dollars flowed back. Thus the Federal Reserve filled up the Treasury’s checking account as a result of a direct loan to a corporation another agency of the federal government owns. In simpler terms, the Federal Reserve made a loan to the rest of the Federal Government. This is a great reminder that there are only restrictions on the Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-government-always-money/\">directly lending to the <strong>Treasury</strong></a>. <br></p><p>This still leaves us with the gap between the size of the discount window loans and how much was put into the treasury’s bank account. It’s hard to know exactly what’s going on without exact data on the balance sheets of the individual FDIC-owned banks, but I do think I have a rough idea of what happened. Recall that these FDIC-owned banks <strong>have their own checking account </strong>with the Federal Reserve, just like all other chartered banks which are members of the Federal Reserve. Also recall what these discount window loans were for in the first place — <strong>depositor outflow</strong>. These payment outflows needed to be covered —  and they <strong>were covered with discount window loans. </strong><br></p><p>Thus it seems to me that the difference between these two amounts —  what was returned to the treasury’s checking account and the size of the discount window loans —  is a maximum estimate of how much deposit outflow there was. That would mean <strong>100 billion</strong> dollars. <br></p><p>Now, these banks could simply have more settlement balances than they started out with before the discount window loans. However, given that before the FDIC took over Silicon Valley Bank it had <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-11/svb-depositors-investors-tried-to-pull-42-billion-on-thursday?ref=crisesnotes.com\">42 billion dollars in (attempted) depositor outflow</a> <strong>in a single day</strong>, I am inclined to think that <strong>100 billion dollars is a good estimate </strong>for how much payment outflow Signature Bridge Bank and Silicon Valley Bridge Bank experienced this week. (Naturally that provisional guesstimate is subject to revision, once we get actual data.)</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>We’ve gone on a journey so far in this piece, and I thank readers for their patience. This brings us to the “debt ceiling”, which motivated this entire piece in the first place. A number of people have expressed concern that covering uninsured depositors will impact the “x” date —  the date that the debt ceiling fully binds. At that point, the treasury has to either default, unconstitutionally raise taxes, or cut spending…Or, well, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/congress-debt-ceiling-trillion-dollar-coin-us-mint/672814/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">mint the coin</a>. <br></p><p>I actually wrote <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e9d6924-42af-4892-951e-dee36a020ea7?ref=crisesnotes.com\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afb6ef8f-be7c-45ac-8a7d-56550b64fd9e?ref=crisesnotes.com\">pieces</a> about the debt ceiling, minting a trillion dollar coin and the Federal Reserve’s role as the government’s banker earlier this year. Sadly, I forgot to promote them over this newsletter (oops!) Nevertheless, those two pieces caused quite a stir, so I promise this isn’t the last you’ll hear about trillion dollar coins on NotC!<br></p><p>All that said, this commonplace concern about this FDIC action moving the “x” date forward is unfounded. But it’s unfounded for an <strong>interesting</strong> reason. The debt ceiling counts these gimmicky non-marketable treasuries <strong>towards</strong> the debt ceiling. That’s true even though they have no financial or monetary impact on the economy. This is a case where doing legal analysis requires that you <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-government-always-money/\">not even consolidate</a> different government agencies together. Thus, whenever the Depository Insurance Fund is marked down, the treasury has <strong>that much more room to issue more treasury securities.</strong><br><br>Of course, it turns out that even that was not necessary because the money that flowed out of the treasury’s checking account was refilled right back because of, essentially, a Federal Reserve loan to the federal government. So one form of public money made it so that <strong>we didn’t need a different form of public money. </strong>The “x” date will only be affected if there is more than 100 billion dollars of losses, and the depository insurance fund is marked as negative. In that case, they borrow from the treasury! This, of course, is silly. Different accounting gimmicks <strong>could make it possible to continue to borrow from the Federal Reserve.</strong><br></p><p>Even sillier, this is not a practical concern, given the timing up the upcoming debt ceiling fight. Recall that resolving a bridge bank and finding a private buyer <em>takes time</em>. The “x” date is estimated to be roughly in June, perhaps July. Even in the unlikely event losses got that massive- perhaps because of <strong>more</strong> bank failures — the FDIC could simply <strong>move slowly</strong>. Since the Federal Reserve is covering all the payment outflows with discount window loans, the depositor outflow can be fully covered without the treasury sending <strong>any</strong> payments. Even if the balance held by the Depositor Insurance Fund was dwarfed by bank losses, the FDIC could simply not finish resolving that situation and “realizing” those losses so that they weren’t forced to draw on their “line of credit”. This is the case even though it's still public money going out the door. It also <strong>looks remarkably similar</strong> to Silicon Valley Bank’s plan to not realize losses. In that case, it was so that the bank wouldn’t fail. In this case, it would be motivated by <strong>not hitting the debt ceiling. </strong><br></p><p>In other words, this part of high finance relies heavily on using one accounting gimmick, so that they don’t trip over another, which would trip over another. This is quite the game of <strong>avoid the dominoes.</strong></p><p><br>Let’s step back for a moment. It’s when you take the full view of all this complexity that I really begin to feel like Charlie from <em>Always Sunny</em>. We have an accounting gimmick called the Depository Insurance Fund to legally authorize a certain amount of payments from the treasury to FDIC owned banks, and thus depositors. That accounting gimmick, in turn, technically owns another accounting gimmick which is called a “non-marketable treasury security”. But because that accounting gimmick has “treasury security” in the name, it <strong>counts against the debt ceiling.</strong> The debt ceiling, of course, is another accounting gimmick. The fact that “non-marketable treasuries'' are <em>called </em>treasuries makes it so that marking down the balance of the Depositor Insurance Fund doesn’t impact the debt ceiling. But it will arbitrarily start if that balance is marked as negative. But only because there isn’t an accounting gimmick to facilitate borrowing from the Federal Reserve, rather than the treasury — <strong>if you desire to realize losses sooner rather than later.</strong></p><p>So far so simple, right?</p><p><br>Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve in practice makes sure that you don’t have to realize those losses until you are good and ready! They simply lend these FDIC owned banks whatever they need, and any excess funds fill up the treasury’s checking account and mark up the Depositor Insurance Fund. All of this could be simplified with much simpler accounting gimmicks that are <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/improving-the-accounting-gimmicks/\">far more understandable</a> to the public. Of course, more understandable accounting gimmicks might be seen as politically inconvenient. <br><br>Indeed, we know they are! Compare this dizzying complexity and Rube Goldbergesque series of accounting gimmicks and creaky set of arrangements to the relative simplicity of depositing a coin at the Federal Reserve. Depositing a coin with a big face value — say <strong>one trillion dollars</strong> — might seem silly, but it takes a sentence to describe. The Federal Reserve is the Treasury’s banker. “The Treasury deposited a coin worth a lot of money in its banking account” is something a five year old could understand — even if they would also laugh. When you really understand the accounting gimmicks that propped up <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-federal/\">the Federal Reserve’s coronavirus crisis response</a>, but also all these other areas of public finance, it is absolutely astounding and galling that a coin which will avert <strong>government default</strong> is where secretary of the treasury Janet Yellen <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e9d6924-42af-4892-951e-dee36a020ea7?ref=crisesnotes.com\">draws the line</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afb6ef8f-be7c-45ac-8a7d-56550b64fd9e?ref=crisesnotes.com\">dismissively declares a potential solution to a huge problem an  “accounting gimmick”</a>.</p><p><br>More fundamentally, it’s completely silly that deposits — which remember are bank created money and are seen as money by their owners — are technically and “ultimately” covered by <strong>issuing treasury securities</strong>. Why? If there’s any place that direct monetary finance makes sense, it's in making sure <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/every-complex-banking-issue-all-at-once-the-failure-of-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-brief-summary-and-five-quick-implications/\">money <strong>is</strong> money</a>. Give these FDIC owned banks a platinum coin, and <strong>tell them</strong> to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e9d6924-42af-4892-951e-dee36a020ea7?ref=crisesnotes.com\">deposit it at the Federal Reserve</a>.

Thank you for your support.\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nWhen I published my piece on Tuesday on the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, I questioned whether Silicon Valley Bank’s failure really was a “systemic risk”. I still don’t think those questions were unfounded. But there was too much to digest in the episode itself for me to spend time thinking about the knock-on effects. One of those knock on effects is on the treasury security market. Why is the issue of uninsured depositors at mid-sized banks having an impact on the treasury market? Answering that takes quite a lot of unpacking. We will also be learning more about it in the coming days, and weeks.\n\n\nThe essential issue seems to be not so much “financial contagion” from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (that’s how systemic risk is ordinarily understood.) Rather, it’s the implications of the Federal Reserve’s actions over the weekend. It is strange to see the Federal Reserve launch a facility commonly interpreted as a “crisis” facility using its 13(3) powers in the current economic situation(check out my Silicon Valley Bank piece as a refresher here). That’s because unemployment is low, inflation has been high and the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates. One interpretation of this event, consequently, is that the Federal Reserve is going to be lowering interest rates.\n\nYet, inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s target. It would be quite an extraordinary situation in these circumstances to see the Federal Reserve lower interest rates at a time of elevated inflation. You can see the dilemma. Government securities dealers — those people who buy and sell treasuries every day — are as confused and unsure as you are about which way interest rates will go, in these circumstances. When bond traders are confused and unsure about which way interest rates will be going to this degree, treasury market issues result.\n\n\nHere is where things get really funny (if you find financial system ironies funny like I do). Remember Silicon Valley Bank? Remember why it failed? Interest rate risk! What was that risk? Interest rates rising and making their bonds worth less! What are those bonds now? More valuable! But it gets better! Many, many participants — including treasury security dealers — have uniformly expected interest rates to keep on rising. What do you not want to be doing when interest rates are rising? Losing money when interest rates rise.\n\n\nHow do you do that? Well, you make bets that work out… if interest rates keep on rising! You might begin to see the problem here.\n\n\nThis weekend a lot of people spent a lot of time haranguing Silicon Valley Bank for not managing its “interest rate risk” properly. In other words, being so exposed to rising interest rates. These bond traders are making sure they aren’t exposed to rising interest rates. But that means they are leveraged, and very exposed to falling interest rates. That’s a replay of many of the same treasury security issues in 2020. I think this kind of leverage should be limited — but that same limitation would keep them more exposed to rising interest rates.\n\n\nOf course, at a deeper level what we are talking about is that risks can be managed, but it's an illusion they can be gotten rid of completely. You can manage interest rate uncertainty, but at the level of the economy as a whole, interest rate uncertainty can’t disappear. One funny thing is that if it did, interest rate changes would have no impact on the economy at all! Everyone would be “compensated” for interest rate changes, because of their “hedges”. So no one’s balance sheet would be affected.\n\nIn the actual world, if everyone bought interest rate risk insurance (a derivative product called interest rate swaps lets say) then the insurers who sold us all this product would risk losing more than what they have put aside to pay claims. They would then go out of business. If they did, we would take losses. Not only that, because of the insurer’s default, we would still be exposed to interest rate changes! Famously, this was essentially what happened with insurance giant AIG in 2008. AIG was selling insurance against the default of a certain type of mortgaged backed bonds called “CDOs”, rather than interest rate risk — but the principle is the same. They sold insurance for one side of a bet in very large amounts, and were threatening bankruptcy that would have taken down the rest of the financial system. So they were duly rescued by Federal Reserve (and federal government) action. You can read more about those 2008 details in this piece I wrote back in 2020. You can’t get rid of the uncertainties, you can only transform one kind of uncertainty (interest rate changes) into another kind (default uncertainty).\n\n\nFrom my point of view all of this is so funny because what’s obvious in one week —“make sure you’re not exposed to interest rate increases!” — becomes “make sure you’re not exposed to interest rate decreases!” next week. The Federal Reserve keeps these contradictions at bay by providing clear guidance about where interest rates are going. What happens changes based on data changes, but generally new data is seen as having a clear implication for what the Federal Reserve is going to do. Today however, that is not the case. Using 13(3) this weekend points to interest rate declines, but continued inflation points to interest rate hikes. Whatever the Federal Reserve decides next week will be a surprise.\n\n\nThe other layer to this are those “treasury liquidity strains” this all started with. When non-experts hear about “liquidity strains” in the treasury market, they tend to assume that means the U.S. treasury has to offer higher interest rates to sell securities. However, that often isn’t the case. In fact, these periods tend to coincide with falling treasury interest rates. In March 2020, liquidity in treasury markets worsened. Some short maturity treasury securities even experienced negative money interest rates. That means the situation was so uncertain, many actors were willing to pay such a premium that they would get less money back when the security matured then they paid for it. After all, losing a bit of your money is better than losing it all. To be clear, I’m not talking about “inflation adjusted” amounts. I mean literally, they paid 100 dollars, and got back 98 dollars.\n\n\nSo if “liquidity strains” don’t necessarily mean rising interest rates, what do they mean? They mean the price at which you can buy a treasury is further away from the price at which you can sell a treasury. In this sense, while we don’t often think about it, there is usually never one “market price” to any item. There is instead the asking price. That’s the price that some entity is willing to sell the item, and the bid price i.e. the price that some entity is willing to buy an item. If you think about it, we experience huge differences between the “buying price” and the “asking price” of items every day. When you go buy something from a corner store, the moment you buy it, you can’t just sell it back to the store, or someone else at the price you bought it. If they are willing to buy it back at all, it will usually be at a huge discount over the selling price.\n\n\nSubscribe\n\nIn the terms of financial professionals, that’s called a large bid-ask spread! This is just a fancy way of saying the difference between the buying price and the selling price. Most of the everyday goods and services we purchase have very large bid ask spreads, and some simply can’t be resold by an individual at any price. This is especially obvious with services. If you purchase a foot rub, you can’t sell that foot rub to someone else for the price you bought it for! You just have to get that foot rub.\n\n\nWhich brings me back to treasury securities. A lot of what happens in financial markets is the creation of new products that have big bid ask spreads because big spreads means big profits. Then other people start participating in these new financial markets and as the market grows, spreads tighten. The market becomes more and more liquid i.e. those bid ask spreads shrink. At that point financial professionals seek out a new illiquid market to create. In other words, financial professionals seek to both buy and sell the same financial assets. The difference between the prices they offer to buy and the prices they offer to sell is their profit margin (very roughly speaking).\n\n\nThe treasury market is supposed to be the most liquid market in the world, i.e. the financial market with the smallest difference between buying and selling prices. Interest rates change all the time, but what that means is just that the buying price and the selling price move together. Unless something like what’s happening now is going on. Let’s think about this by thinking about the interest rate uncertainties we’re currently experiencing.\n\n\nNormally, bond traders have a pretty good sense of where interest rates are going to go. They are not always right (by any stretch). But this usually does not impact the differences between buying and selling prices that much. One way to think about this is, when bond traders are wrong they tend to be wrong slow enough and gradual enough that there is time for them to “catch up”. And generally, for the past 30 years if not more, when they are really wrong it's obvious. So both buying and selling prices really jump. When Lehman Brothers collapsed, everyone understood short term interest rates were going to go to zero and stay there for a while. If inflation had been 6% when Lehman collapsed, the treasury market may have faced the same problems it's facing now.\n\n\nFaced with this uncertainty, the treasury market is getting less liquid. That means selling prices and buying prices are diverging even though interest rates are overall declining. But remember those bets that so many government bond market participants made? This is where they get hammered twice. Not only are interest rates going down when they expected interest rates are going up. In addition, “bidding interest rates” and “selling interest rates” are diverging, when these same bets often assume that the treasury market is liquid. In other words, embedded in these bets about the direction of interest rates are bets about the differences between bidding interest rates, and selling interest rates. In short, they also bet the spread would be small when the spread has been getting larger.\n\n\nThe final component of this on my radar is something that financial economist Daniela Gabor said over on Twitter:\n\n\n\n\n\n“Why would you sell securities you can monetise at the Fed for par value?” This returns us to a more direct impact of the Silicon Valley Bank failure and the Federal Reserve response than the possible implications of that response for interest rate policy. The Bank Term Funding Program (again read Tuesday’s piece for the details) provides terms that are so overwhelmingly generous. That calls into question why any chartered bank (“depository institution”) who is allowed to access the BTFP would be selling treasury securities right now. What’s the point? You get a better deal handing it over to the Fed as security for a loan.\n\n\nThis makes sense for them individually, but it means suddenly trillions of dollars of treasury securities are not available for sale. Many fewer treasury securities “in circulation” must be having an impact on this liquidity situation. These banks would need a selling price that is much higher than the buying price, in order to be willing to sell their securities. This is a fluid and volatile situation, where the news coming out is confusing and fast paced. As a result, it will be months, maybe even years, before we have a good idea of how big the direct impact of this quasi-emergency facility was. Some other elements of this piece may be subject to revision once we learn more. But this is how I think the “state of play” looks today.\n\n\nSo what does all this mean? What’s the policy implication? There are a number, but for right now the big picture I want to end on is that it’s hard for me to see this as a result of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. Events may further call into question the view I provided on Tuesday. But I don’t actually think the treasury market strains illustrate that they were right to treat this as a crisis (Credit Suisse might, I am still formulating my view on that particular crisis!) Instead, what they illustrate is that the Federal Reserve didn’t think through what they were doing.\n\n\nIt is no secret I have not been a fan of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases. However, if you are going to continue them then, when you announce the use of what is normally seen as a crisis facility, that should come with clear explanations of the implications for interest rates. Indeed, it's maddening to even have to say this! Forward guidance is supposed to be what the modern Federal Reserve is all about! If they had said “interest rates will keep on increasing as usual, though we probably will be doing smaller interest rate hikes for the next three months”, then the implications of this situation would be clear. Treasury security interest rates would have rapidly adjusted without impairing treasury liquidity.\n\nOf course, the Federal Reserve might not want to do that — because they might want to avoid acting like the European Central Bank and raising interest rates into the teeth of a potential financial crisis, like the ECB did in June 2008 (or, um, what it just did today). But then, if you’re worried about that eventuality, you simply say you are pausing interest rate increases for the next three months! You can even declare that you will be doing small interest rate cuts. But you don’t have to go that far. Regardless, provide forward (i.e. \"future”) guidance on whatever you will be doing soon! Getting things “a little wrong” is better than causing more financial system problems with indecision.\n\n\nNow, there may still be a question of those big bets taken on rising interest rates in this circumstance. With smaller spreads, i.e. better liquidity because they provided clear expectations those issues would be less severe. But nonetheless, there may be some “liquidity strains” which appear as a result of those. All that means is you need to pair your crisis response with more treasury security purchases. I know the Federal Reserve is obsessed with “shrinking its balance sheet”, but net selling treasury securities doesn’t actually change economic conditions very much. It simply periodically causes financial market problems, which force them to start net buying treasuries again. Preemptively announce the purchases when you know there will be issues, and let's skip the whole song and dance. As I said in 2020: “The Way People Talk About the Federal Reserve's “Big” Balance Sheet is All Wrong”. Indeed, the Fed is already “expanding its balance sheet”, lending against treasury securities with its fancy new program right now!\nThis is why I haven’t been convinced that there was really systemic risk involved in the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank. Most of the issues which we are seeing right now are caused by the incomplete and incoherent Federal Reserve response, rather than the direct financial institution implications that were originally brought up.(A big exception is Credit Suisse, that I'll be investigating shortly.) As I said earlier, I may yet revise my views on the Fed's response. But even if I do, their response still makes no sense, and has proven to be incredibly shortsighted. Make a decision, stick to it, then make financial conditions consistent with your decision. Wishy washiness is a killer in times of financial stress. Let’s see how Tuesday’s FOMC meeting goes. I hope their choice to wait that long does not prove fatal.\n\nPrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p></p><p><em>Special note to readers.

But there was too much to digest in the episode itself for me to spend time thinking about the knock-on effects. One of those knock on effects <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/adb74b25-ee03-4bdd-8c7a-4dcc6c95fcac?ref=crisesnotes.com\">is on the treasury security market</a>. Why is the issue of uninsured depositors at mid-sized banks having an impact on the treasury market? Answering that takes quite a lot of unpacking. We will also be learning more about it in the coming days, and weeks.<br></p><p>The essential issue seems to be not so much “financial contagion” from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (that’s how systemic risk is ordinarily understood.) Rather, it’s the implications of the Federal Reserve’s actions over the weekend. It is strange to see the Federal Reserve launch a facility commonly interpreted as a “crisis” facility using its 13(3) powers in the current economic situation(check out my Silicon Valley Bank piece as a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/every-complex-banking-issue-all-at-once-the-failure-of-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-brief-summary-and-five-quick-implications/\">refresher here</a>). That’s because unemployment is low, inflation has been high and the Federal Reserve is <strong>raising interest rates. </strong>One interpretation of this event, consequently, is that the Federal Reserve is going to be <em>lowering interest rates</em>. <br><br>Yet, <strong>inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s target. </strong>It would be quite an extraordinary situation in these circumstances to see the Federal Reserve lower interest rates at a time of elevated inflation. You can see the dilemma. Government securities dealers — those people who buy and sell treasuries every day — are as confused and unsure as you are about which way interest rates will go, in these circumstances. When bond traders are confused and unsure about which way interest rates will be going to this degree, treasury market issues result.<br></p><p>Here is where things get really funny (if you find financial system ironies funny like I do). Remember Silicon Valley Bank? Remember why it failed? Interest rate risk! What was that risk? Interest rates rising and making their bonds worth less! What are those bonds now? More valuable! But it gets better! Many, many participants — including treasury security dealers — have uniformly expected interest rates to keep on rising. What do you not want to be doing when interest rates are rising? <strong>Losing money when interest rates rise. </strong><br></p><p>How do you do that? Well, you make bets that work out…<strong> if interest rates keep on rising! </strong>You might begin to see the problem here. <br></p><p>This weekend a lot of people spent a lot of time haranguing Silicon Valley Bank for not managing its “interest rate risk” properly. In other words, being so exposed to rising interest rates. These bond traders are making sure they aren’t exposed to rising interest rates. But that means they are leveraged, and very exposed to falling interest rates. That’s a replay of many of the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\">same treasury security issues in 2020</a>. I think this kind of leverage should be limited — but that same limitation would keep them more exposed to rising interest rates. <br></p><p>Of course, at a deeper level what we are talking about is that risks can be managed, but it's an illusion they can be gotten rid of completely. You can manage interest rate uncertainty, but at the level of the economy as a whole, interest rate uncertainty can’t disappear. One funny thing is that if it did, interest rate changes would have no impact on the economy at all! Everyone would be “compensated” for interest rate changes, because of their “hedges”. So <strong>no one’s balance sheet would be affected.</strong><br><br>In the actual world, if everyone bought interest rate risk insurance (a derivative product called interest rate swaps lets say) then the insurers who sold us all this product would risk losing more than what they have put aside to pay claims. They would then go out of business. If they did, we would take losses. Not only that, because of the insurer’s default, we would still be exposed to interest rate changes! Famously, this was essentially <strong>what happened with insurance giant AIG in 2008. </strong>AIG was selling insurance against the default of a certain type of mortgaged backed bonds called “CDOs”, rather than interest rate risk — but the principle is the same. They sold insurance for one side of a bet in very large amounts, and were threatening bankruptcy that would have taken down the rest of the financial system. So they were duly rescued by Federal Reserve (and federal government) action. You can read more about those 2008 details in this piece <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-there-really-a-looming-bank-collapse/\">I wrote back in 2020</a>.

I hope their choice to wait that long <strong>does not prove fatal.</strong></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nXMbAzll-mtfUJN3zx-pAHj287Vxwc9v/view?usp=sharing&ref=crisesnotes.com\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Printer Friendly Version</a></div>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/whats-going-on-with-treasuries-silicon-valley-bank-and-the-incoherence-of-the-federal-reserves-lack-of-an-interest-rate-policy-this-week/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"7b1f4ed0-c87f-40b5-95c7-b6cca2695539","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"64136cb75e6a30003d217382","reading_time":11}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"March 14","id":"Ghost__Post__6410acdf5e6a30003d2064cf","title":"Every Complex Banking Issue All At Once: The Failure of Silicon Valley Bank in One Brief Summary and Five Quick Implications","slug":"every-complex-banking-issue-all-at-once-the-failure-of-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-brief-summary-and-five-quick-implications","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2023/03/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ver3_xlg-691x1024.jpg","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/480ed457adaa7148f8c68ee8454cff38/35255/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ver3_xlg-691x1024.jpg","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/480ed457adaa7148f8c68ee8454cff38/0a8b2/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ver3_xlg-691x1024.jpg 173w,\n/migrantinsider/static/480ed457adaa7148f8c68ee8454cff38/4b3c5/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ver3_xlg-691x1024.jpg 346w,\n/migrantinsider/static/480ed457adaa7148f8c68ee8454cff38/35255/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ver3_xlg-691x1024.jpg 691w","sizes":"(min-width: 691px) 691px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/480ed457adaa7148f8c68ee8454cff38/64475/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ver3_xlg-691x1024.webp 173w,\n/migrantinsider/static/480ed457adaa7148f8c68ee8454cff38/0302c/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ver3_xlg-691x1024.webp 346w,\n/migrantinsider/static/480ed457adaa7148f8c68ee8454cff38/79b71/everything_everywhere_all_at_once_ver3_xlg-691x1024.webp 691w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 691px) 691px, 100vw"}]},"width":691,"height":1024}}},"excerpt":"Financial crisis nerds have had quite a weekend.

In short order the one-of-a-kind Silicon Valley Bank began to reportedly be experiencing losses, and large uninsured depositors began loudly and aggressively “pulling” their deposits. Following that, the bank predictably experienced liquidity issues, and then was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Friday morning. A haze of uncertainty about what the governmental response would be emerged with the issue of significant losses for uninsured depositors — reportedly a raft of tech start ups —on the table. Recall that any account with a balance at or below 250,000 dollars in a FDIC member bank is “insured”, and thus the government will promptly make sure that a depositor has access to that money — “dollar for dollar”. Above that amount, the deposit account is “uninsured”, and could experience losses if the bank does not have enough assets of equivalent value.\n\n\nAs debate raged over whether the tech industry’s bank account large balances should be fully saved by government action, unofficial details of a government response emerged. These details were confusing. Initially it was reported that the FDIC and the Federal Reserve would create a “joint facility”. What would a “joint facility” between the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve look like? What would that entail? Since the details didn’t make sense, it was hard to tell whether this was an incoherent press rumor, or early reporting on a real plan that was in the process of being executed. It turns out it was the latter.\n\n\nHowever, what actually emerged made more sense, but was still shocking. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced it was covering all depositors, whether they were insured or not. At the same time, but separately, the Federal Reserve is launching a new facility called the “Bank Term Funding Program”. This facility is an expanded form of the discount window, which has a few notable features. It provides loans of up to 1 year to any “depository institution” against any collateral which the Federal Reserve buys in open market operations. In other words, the collateral can be a treasury security, a government guaranteed mortgage backed security, or similar security. This facility’s further notable feature is that, for the purposes of securing a loan from the Federal Reserve, these bonds are valued quite favorably. I will also discuss this in more detail later on. But you can also read my basic 2020 explainer on the neglected area of central bank “collateral policy” here.\n\n\nAt first, it wasn’t clear what legal authority this facility was being launched based on. But then it was announced that they were using 13(3) authority which requires “unusual and exigent circumstances”. I will discuss the legal implications of this below, but for now it suffices to say that it is very surprising for 13(3) to be used under these economic conditions and in this circumstance. That does not mean it is illegal or that it was unwise to invoke this legal authority. It is simply surprising. There were concerns that there would be a “run” on other regional banks. But it seems that this action was at least equally motivated by the knock on effects on the companies that banked with Silicon Valley Bank — and especially two payroll processing companies. In other words, companies that responsibly manage their own banking relationships might see their workers not receive their paychecks because of disruption to the company they pay to send out individual wage and salary payments to their employees. Yesterday’s Politico article is well worth reading to get some sense of what the internal Biden administration discussions were like over the weekend.\n\n\nRegardless of the reason, they did it. Monday passed without incident, though there are anecdotal reports that deposits will continue to flow out of regional banks, and towards the largest banks such as Goldman Sachs or Citigroup (an issue I will turn to next). The stock prices of other regional banks did go down by, in some cases, more than 50%. However, stock trading should always be looked at skeptically when analyzing financial issues. Sometimes financial institutions are in very bad shape, and the stock price declines reflect larger liquidity and/or solvency concerns. Other times, stock prices reflect the unique and distinct opinions — and herd mentality —of stock traders (who rarely talk to bond traders, let alone detail oriented financial analysts). These traders simply bet that lines will go down because the vibes are off, but don’t have much impact on other financial markets. My inclination, given the evidence I’ve seen, is that Monday’s stock trading experience reflected the latter, rather than the former. However, it's too early to tell. Though as of this writing these same banks have experienced stock price gains, so it seems even stock traders today are agreeing with my assessment of their behavior yesterday. Even still, I am not anywhere near confident enough in that hunch to commit to it, and then see regional banks experience fatal runs.\n\n\nReaders should be able to tell by now that quite a number of issues have been raised by the failure of this one quixotic bank. One piece can’t comprehensively summarize and dissect all these issues. Indeed, I suspect I will be dealing with the events of the past weekend for the next four months, at the very least. However, I can briefly touch on the five issues which have been on my mind the most for the past 100 hours. Some of these observations I will return to at much greater length in the coming days, and weeks.\n\n\n1) Bank money is money unless it is not money\n\nOftentimes in financial writing, financial writers shy away from the biggest topics. It’s hard to tie the big picture issues to current events a lot of the time, and they can seem abstract or abstruse. It’s hard, even for the clearest writers among us, to make these issues seem lively and important. Strangely enough, in this respect, I am very grateful to this mini-episode. The reason is this episode has dramatized my favorite and most abstract topics, three of which I will quickly discuss in this piece.\n\nThe first one is this topic —is a bank deposit money? This might seem like a silly question. Outside of physical cash, bank deposits are the most common form of money we use. We pay off our credit cards, we pay rent or mortgages, and we receive our paychecks in the form of bank deposits. Not only do we use our bank account balances as money, we often use it at par. That simply means that if our credit card bill is 1087 dollars, the credit card company debits our account — at our direction —for the amount of 1087 dollars and the amount is paid off. This point is so basic and simple, many readers will be confused by it out of an assumption that I must be saying something more complicated.\n\n\nOf course, sometimes making payments out of our bank account involve fees. This interferes with the exact equivalence between different dollar amounts that exist in different forms. However, a fixed fee only minutely separates equivalence between the balance in our bank accounts, and the payments we must incur a fee to make. On a percentage basis, this divergence from “par” may be insignificant. Even the percentage based processing fees charged by many payment processors and credit card companies are small and stable. For example, Stripe is the payment processor which lies behind this newsletter. It charges 2.9% +30 cents. This is sand in the wheels, but it does not disrupt the whole enterprise.\n\n\nThis all might seem far afield from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, but it is not. In some fundamental sense, it's the critical issue. Because bank deposits are not money (at least not fully) to everyone. To you or I, who can’t dream of having anything close to 250 grand in the bank, for all intents and purposes, bank deposits are always money to us. (Rich people, I hope you can forgive me for not writing as if you are my audience. Speeches can be more easily tailored to your perspective and concerns). However, to businesses, bank deposits carry risk they have to manage. To businesses, they need to put their excess cash in “alternative” financial assets if they want to be completely assured of safety.\n\n\nThis is why short maturity treasury securities are such useful instruments. You can hold billions of dollars, without taking on the risk of a bank failing. The issue of “shadow banking” also emerges because of uninsured deposits. The siren song of “good collateral” which could back “shadow money”, and thus make it more secure than an uninsured bank deposit calls out to these big depositors. It helps when they are offered a better return. I can’t cover this issue at the length it deserves, here. But it suffices to say the seemingly small issue of uninsured deposits have big implications for the financial structure of the entire global economy. Tackling that issue was one of the things I took on in the monetary policy report I released early last year.\n\n\nSome wish that the big Silicon Valley depositors had taken losses. It is true that these balances could have been better managed and these tech businesses seemed to have done little to no due diligence. One of the options available to them was actually a financial technology (“Fintech”) option, that should have excited tech executives. With a system called “Insured Cash Sweep”, a large uninsured deposit can be transformed into quite a large number of insured deposits of 250,000 dollars in dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of other banks. All it costs is a fee. This option is available in amounts ranging between 50 million and 150 million dollars. If Silicon Valley Bank had run this system, it might have earned a reasonable amount of fee income, those deposits would have been safe. It then could have avoided holding a large quantity of long maturity securities which it would come to take losses on.\n\n\nYet, look at this from another perspective, what purpose does that convoluted system for backing uninsured deposits with insured deposits serve? In some ways, these “brokered” deposits look more like the shadow money issued outside the banking system (or more accurately, outside the banking subsidiary). In other words, this is just another way of reassuring those with large balances that they have good enough collateral to treat these balances as unconditionally money. What’s unique in this case is that the collateral is simply insured bank deposits. All this nonsense can be eliminated by simply removing the cap on deposit insurance, and admitting that a bank deposit is money, and should just be treated straightforwardly as such. The alternative is treating bank deposits as “fully” money most of the time, except when a crisis hits, or you’re engaging in risk management at a corporate treasury. Meanwhile that ‘risk management”, has all sorts of negative knock on effects.\n\nOf course, the other reason to avoid fully and unconditionally declaring bank deposits money is that this has big implications. The other situation people like to pretend that bank deposits are not money is when they want to treat bank deposits as a matter of private initiative, and discipline. Rather than acknowledging that banks acquire assets based on the powers granted to them by a bank charter, some would like to pretend they acquire assets on the basis of the discipline, and oversight of uninsured depositors. In this vision the regulations we have are supposed to prevent financial crises, and protect the FDIC’s “insurance fund” which covers insured deposits. But they are not designed with the idea in mind that every asset a bank acquires happens on the back of the full faith and credit of the United States government.\n\n\nBefore this weekend, most people did not see things the way I and my closest colleagues did — even a number of banking law scholars I am friendly with. I still think that my demand management report from  last year was unique in tying together this perspective with a fully fleshed out framework of just how much we should tighten the rules regulating the quality and quantity of assets that banks can acquire. In the most comprehensive version of this program (as opposed to an alternative “minimal” program), the implications were far reaching and involved bringing those financial institutions deeply reliant on loans and lines of credit from chartered banks into the chartered banking system. Few have gone as far as that “comprehensive” proposal. Yet after the events of this weekend, opinions are clearly quite shaken. The prospect of unlimited deposit insurance, whether de facto or de jure, is leading to a large-scale reconsideration of views among even “moderate” banking scholars. With the remaining embers of the dream of liability side discipline of banking being extinguished, proposals for far tighter asset side regulations will clearly proliferate.\n\n\nBringing things full circle, such a comprehensive program could tighten financial conditions throughout the economy. This could reduce aggregate demand without direct effects on interest rates, and certainly with leaving governmental “default risk free” interest rates low. From my perspective, relying much more heavily on direct credit regulation solves the problems posed by fully and unconditionally treating bank deposits as money, and the issue of providing alternative monetary policy tools for managing demand conditions. Two birds, one stone. Uninsured deposits have been a nagging issue hanging over from the last 40 years of banking history. This moment may be just the thing to resolve that issue forever, simplify banking and put an alternative vision of banking and its place in society on the table.\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n2) Central bank collateral policy makes a sudden, splashy return\n\nI’m not going to be able to devote the time to this issue today that I would like because it's one of the most fundamental issues to come out of this crisis and is an issue I’ve tried to hammer over and over. The flipside of bank runs is the Federal Reserve’s role as a “lender of last resort”, or even simply a lender to banks. This lending typically happens through the “discount window”. As I wrote in 2020, a number of the facilities that the Federal Reserve launches in crises are simply expanding the discount window in ways that they are not authorized to by the part of the Federal Reserve Act which governs the discount window (more pointedly, they may also simply want to keep such temporary expansions separate from the discount window all together). This is one of the most technical and neglected areas of central banking and, until this weekend, it had receded into the background as 2020 moved further into the past.\n\n\nOne of the major issues that discount window discussions center around is the issue of collateral. Central banks have all sorts of choices in what value they can place on the asset used to secure a discount window loan. Recall that collateral is simply an asset that an entity can take ownership of if its debtor defaults. For more discussion of collateral and central bank collateral policy, read this introductory piece I wrote in 2020. For the purposes of this discussion all that matters is any asset has three prices, its acquisition price, its market price and its collateral price. To avoid taking losses lenders like to set collateral prices significantly below market prices. The flipside of that choice is that even if there is no stigma to borrowing from the Federal Reserve, there is only so much of your funding you can get from the Federal Reserve. If an asset was acquired for 100 dollars but its collateral price is only 70 dollars, then you need 30 dollars of funding from elsewhere even if you pledge the full value of the asset as collateral for your discount window loan.\n\n\nSilicon Valley Bank experienced this issue in spades as the market price of its assets had fallen below their acquisition price. The collateral price was, in turn, significantly below that market price. Thus, even if Silicon Valley Bank had begun borrowing from the discount window in large amounts it would not have been enough to cover deposit outflows. Nonetheless, it's still unclear why they did not go to the discount window, though many have pointed out that they began borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Board, which is a kind of “lender of second-to-last resort” and which needs discussion in its own right. What was extraordinary about this weekend is that the announced Bank Term Funding Program is setting collateral prices for securities at acquisition price. This means that you can borrow 100 dollars against an asset you acquired for 100 dollars but which now is worth 50 dollars. If this had existed Wednesday, Silicon Valley Bank would have been able to cover all of its deposit outflows. It’s hard to emphasize how good of a deal that is relative to past conventions around the discount window and Federal Reserve collateral policy.\n\n\nIn a way, this topic is simply another way of discussing the last section. Banks, through their bank charters, are allowed to acquire assets by issuing bank deposits that are treated as money. Any individual creation of bank deposits may lead to a payment outflow that must be covered by the account that bank has, in turn, with the Federal Reserve. But in aggregate, the banking system holds trillions of dollars of assets which are not matched by borrowing at the discount window. Instead, they are matched by the banking deposits that the banking system has issued. In normal times, this is basically irrelevant. Yes, banks periodically have to “compete for deposits” to find funding that is cheaper than interbank borrowing. But the idea that bank asset growth is limited by trigger happy depositors looking for the exit is clearly untrue. Bank runs happen, as we have just seen. But bank runs are not typical and they are the textbook example of when a central bank is supposed to step in. A bank experiencing rapid asset growth may have higher funding costs than banks growing less fast, but it is their high costs which will lead them to slow growth (outside of control frauds), not some conception that they “can’t find funding”.\n\n\nSo let's step back for a moment. As I said on Saturday on twitter “A lot of the discussion this weekend is coming close to accepting @rohangrey's argument that any asset a bank is authorized to make should be acceptable collateral at acquisition price at the discount window.” This point was quickly illustrated by the Federal Reserve’s actions the following day (and quoted by Matt Levine at Bloomberg on Monday!). When I said this, I didn’t think the Federal Reserve would follow our recommendation in less than 24 hours. If the discount window only has unattractive collateral prices and limited availability when banks mostly don’t need it but expands- either directly or through crisis facilities- when they do, isn’t it kind of like the Federal Reserve is always backstopping banks acquiring and holding those assets?\n\n\nThe difference then, which again goes back to the previous section, is that the “tight” discount window in good times facilitates the fiction that these assets are acquired and held on the back of the volition of private actors, rather than the backing of the United States government. This, in turn, justifies far looser asset side regulations. The alternative, which my colleague Rohan Grey at Williamette University has proposed in detail in a book chapter entitled “Banking in a Digital Fiat Currency Regime”, is for all bank assets to be automatically matched with a discount window loan of the same maturity which treats the collateral price as the same as the acquisition price, just as the Federal Reserve did this weekend with its new crisis facility. The chapter is about “digital fiat currency” because proposals for a new digital currency are typically met with concerns over deposit outflow. Many more people holding these balances, far fewer bank deposits and thus less funding for banks.\n\n\nIf you look at the world the way Rohan and I do, deposit outflow as a result of digital fiat currency, bank accounts directly provided by the Federal Reserve to the public and/or postal banking is a feature not a bug. Once we separate and clearly distinguish payments processing from bank lending, we can see that all chartered bank deposits do is paper over the fundamental contradiction between the assets we let banks acquire through their own money creation and the lack of official backstop in good times for holding those assets through direct borrowing from the Federal Reserve. It is absolutely perverse to intentionally weaken new technologies and better payment processing options out of fear of banks “losing deposit funding”. The gap between the terms and quantities that banks can access the discount window and the terms and quantities banks can create bank deposits is a gap measuring the extent to which our financial regulatory and banking regime is lying to both ourselves and each other. Why would we want banks to control payments processing and credit to the non-financial economy? If we can separate these businesses, and we can, then we should.\n\n\nIt should be obvious from the far reaching implications of what we are saying why there are few who fully share our views. Yet, this weekend was again a turning point. It wasn’t Rohan and I who tied fully protecting depositors,  facilitating the holding of bank assets and increasing the collateral price, maturity and availability of Federal Reserve lending. The joint statement from the Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve did that. They have hammered and highlighted the contradiction between what you can fund with uninsured deposits and what you can fund directly with the Federal Reserve and they choose to shrink that gap by expanding the discount window. This weekend has been an almost unbelievable gift to the research agenda we are engaged in.\n\n\n3) Is there really systemic risk in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank?\n\nWhen systemic risk is being discussed, usually it is assumed that we are talking about very broad implications. The Great Financial Crisis was a classic example. What the public was told was “if all the biggest banks in the world fail, the entire global economy is going with them”. Yet it should be obvious that this term is fairly slippery. What exactly does systemic mean? How wide are the consequences of “systemic”? After all, we all exist in a great chain of being, and something that affects one of us affects us all. If you use the definition proffered by the Three Musketeers, any risk at all is a “systemic risk”.\n\n\nThis circumstance is clearly not quite that extreme, but it is also certainly not a cut and dry case of “systemic risk”. Indeed, the prospect that uninsured deposits would be covered in full by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seemed relatively dim. At least, if you followed the debate over the weekend among the small set of experts who have both financial system knowledge, and expertise in the legal nuances of the U.S. financial regulatory apparatus. This was precisely because of the legal limitations the FDIC had operated under in the aftermath of the Savings & Loan Crisis. Known as the “least cost” test, it restricts the FDIC from taking actions which will involve greater drawings on the Deposit Insurance Fund. It will not surprise readers to find out that I think this whole schema is a silly “accounting gimmick”.\n\n\nRegardless, the main exemption to the “least cost” rule is known as the “systemic risk” exemption. If not covering those uninsured deposits is legally designated a “systemic risk”, they will cover them. I personally thought that there is more leeway to work around the “least cost” rule in covering uninsured deposits than others expressed, rather than invoking this exemption. But that is more of an irrelevant detail now. They invoked the systemic risk exemption, and here we are.\n\n\nWhat is still not clear is what exactly they identified as a systemic risk. In invoking the exemption, they don’t have to say. More to the point, as I am always quick to point out in these circumstances, who has legal standing to challenge their legal interpretation in court? As you can see from the summary above, they didn’t think the entire banking system was in crisis. Does the liquidity situation of a number of regional banks, which may be able to weather this storm in a way Silicon Valley Bank was not, count as a “systemic risk”? The Politico piece also discusses concerns over the fate of two payroll processing companies.\n\n\nThat clearly matters, but if that is enough to have “systemic risk” then we are a long way down from the interconnections feared in the Great Financial Crisis. As we’ll see in the next section, this defining down of systemic risk, or its Federal Reserve Act equivalent, has major implications for how these powers will be used in the future. In this respect, it can be a mistake to get too bogged down in the details of what actions they’ve taken and what knock on effects they discussed over this very busy weekend. The big picture here is that these powers can always be invoked as long as there is a possible effect that can be found which can be characterized as systemic and has a plausibly decent chance of happening. That legal standard is not a standard at all. The restraint is just what actions congress will sanction if taken in the future. That is a very loose standard, to say the least.\n\n\nSubscribe now\n\n4) 13(3) is no longer an emergency authority\n\nColumbia law professor Lev Menand likes to tease me over extremely nerdy financial regulation dinners about what he sees as my extremely, ahem, “creative” and “expansive” interpretation of the Federal Reserve Act. If you read his recent book, “Fed Unbound”, you will understand where he’s coming from. The discretion the Federal Reserve has claimed for itself without much debate is truly staggering. In our conversations I like to emphasize the selectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s legal creativity, rather than its expansiveness. To me what’s far more concerning is who the Federal Reserve gets creative for, rather than the mere fact that it interprets its legal authority widely (rather than narrowly.) A Federal Reserve which pushed the limits of the Federal Reserve act on behalf of state and local governments would have produced a more well functioning and less unequal economy over the past forty years.\n\n\nYet, this episode has pushed even my limits. If you read section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve act, which is the basis for virtually all emergency lending that the Federal Reserve has engaged in since 2007, the key phrase that debates focus on is “unusual and exigent circumstances”. Thus, almost every legal question about the limits and scope of 13(3) hangs on what the legal interpretation of this phrase is. Conventionally, this phrase is taken as a flowery way of saying “emergency”. So the debate shortcuts to what exactly counts as an emergency, which is a familiar issue from other areas of law. One obvious recent example is whether, to what extent and for how long does the global Covid-19 pandemic count as an “emergency”. How big of an event does something have to be to be an emergency?\n\n\nAs we’ve seen in the last section, this latest event has shaken these interpretations to their core. If this is an emergency, then basically any moderately sized event with a knock on effect on the economy is an emergency. In other words, now either everything is an emergency or this is not an emergency power at all. Which interpretation is more accurate is more of a philosophical question than anything else, and has little practical significance. “Unsual and exigent circumstances” seem now to be little more than a day where there was moderately bad weather.\n\nPart of what colors my thinking about this is that I was, as readers know, a huge advocate of state and local government lending by the Federal Reserve throughout the first two years of the crisis. However, over time I stopped focusing on this point (at least in my day to day writing) because it seemed to me to lose practical relevance with each passing day once the crisis facilities were closed. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, there is going to be no interest in even listening to a proposal to use state and local government lending powers, let alone to use 13(3) authority to do so. Chairman Powell clearly believes that such a program would even be illegal under today’s circumstances, and would likely say so if asked.\n\n\nI of course disagree with that legal interpretation, but I have found it hard to muster the effort to argue about it. It seemed pointless to me. But now that the Bank Term Funding Program exists on the basis of 13(3) authority, I am compelled to return to this issue. Because they are invoking 13(3) under these economic circumstances i.e. significant inflation and low unemployment. Not only that, the “emergency” involved here is, at best, very debatable. Before I was battling for a more expansive interpretation of 13(3) which allows use in otherwise very good economic times. Now the Federal Reserve has provided me precedent. Now, they only avoid engaging in state and local government lending because they don’t want to. Because what is an emergency has always been, but definitely is now, simply a matter of taste. Just ask Detroit, or Puerto Rico.\n\n5) Competition law and Banking.\n\n\nThis is both the last topic I will briefly cover. Flouting tradition, it is also the least important. Competition law in banking is more an intellectual curiosity that I hope to return to in future years. There are many unconfirmed reports that Silicon Valley Bank required its customers who wanted access to loans, or lines of credit to hold all their operating cash with Silicon Valley Bank. The implication of these unconfirmed reports is that these uninsured depositors were compelled to take on this default uncertainty, which exploded over the past week. These kinds of arrangements are called “tying arrangements” in competition law, also known as “vertical restraints”. Financial regulators in the United States have jurisdiction over what would otherwise be competition law issues, and there are anti-tying financial regulatory laws. However, there are exemptions to these anti-tying laws. In general this is a good impetus for reexamining those exemptions, and consider narrowing them. Obviously, it's also important to confirm those unconfirmed reports, and find out more details.\n\n\nThat’s all for today, but all these issues need greater examination, and more discussion. In particular, the history of the 1984 failure of the Continental Illinois bank needs to be reviewed and discussed in detail — as well as how that failure changed the FDIC. The Federal Reserve’s discount window and its role in the big picture of banking law needs to be discussed from a wide variety of angles. Financially, the ever-widening meaning of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act will not be going away, not by a long shot. It’s going to be quite an interesting series of weeks as the full implications of this weekend play out. I look forward to covering them for you.\n\n\nThis was a free piece of Notes on the Crises.

In short order the one-of-a-kind Silicon Valley Bank began to reportedly be experiencing losses, and large uninsured depositors began loudly and aggressively “pulling” their deposits. Following that, the bank predictably experienced liquidity issues, and then was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Friday morning. A haze of uncertainty about what the governmental response would be emerged with the issue of significant losses for uninsured depositors — reportedly a raft of tech start ups —on the table. Recall that any account with a balance at or below 250,000 dollars in a FDIC member bank is “insured”, and thus the government will promptly make sure that a depositor has access to that money — “dollar for dollar”. Above that amount, the deposit account is “uninsured”, and could experience losses if the bank does not have enough assets of equivalent value.<br></p><p>As debate raged over whether the tech industry’s bank account large balances should be fully saved by government action, unofficial details of a government response emerged. These details were confusing. Initially it was reported that the FDIC and the Federal Reserve would create a “joint facility”. What would a “joint facility” between the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve look like? What would that entail? Since the details didn’t make sense, it was hard to tell whether this was an incoherent press rumor, or early reporting on a real plan that was in the process of being executed. It turns out it was the latter.<br></p><p>However, what actually emerged made more sense, <strong>but was still shocking. </strong>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced it was covering all depositors, <strong>whether they were insured or not</strong>. At the same time, but separately, the Federal Reserve is launching <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20230312a1.pdf\">a new facility</a> called the “Bank Term Funding Program”. This facility is an expanded form of the discount window, which has a few notable features. It provides loans of up to 1 year to any “depository institution” against any collateral which the Federal Reserve buys in open market operations. In other words, the collateral can be a treasury security, a government guaranteed mortgage backed security, or similar security. This facility’s further notable feature is that, for the purposes of securing a loan from the Federal Reserve, these bonds are valued quite favorably. I will also discuss this in more detail later on. But you can also read my basic 2020 explainer on the neglected area of central bank “collateral policy” <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/central-bank-collateral-policy-monetarypolicy101/\">here</a>.<br></p><p>At first, it wasn’t clear what legal authority this facility was being launched based on. But then it was announced that they were using 13(3) authority which requires “unusual and exigent circumstances”. I will discuss the legal implications of this below, but for now it suffices to say that it is very surprising for 13(3) to be used under these economic conditions and in this circumstance. That does not mean it is illegal or that it was unwise to invoke this legal authority. It is simply surprising. There were concerns that there would be a “run” on other regional banks. But it seems that this action was at least equally motivated by the knock on effects on the companies that banked with Silicon Valley Bank — and especially two payroll processing companies. In other words, companies that responsibly manage their own banking relationships might see their workers not receive their paychecks because of disruption to the company they pay to send out individual wage and salary payments to their employees. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/13/the-emergency-bank-rescue-that-almost-didnt-happen-72-hours-00086868?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Yesterday’s <em>Politico</em> article is well worth reading</a> to get some sense of what the internal Biden administration discussions were like over the weekend.<br></p><p>Regardless of the reason, they did it. Monday passed without incident, though there are anecdotal reports that deposits will continue to flow out of regional banks, and towards the largest banks such as Goldman Sachs or Citigroup (an issue I will turn to next). The stock prices of other regional banks did go down by, in some cases, more than 50%. However, stock trading should always be looked at skeptically when analyzing financial issues. Sometimes financial institutions are in very bad shape, and the stock price declines reflect larger liquidity and/or solvency concerns. Other times, stock prices reflect the unique and distinct opinions — and herd mentality —of stock traders (who rarely talk to bond traders, let alone detail oriented financial analysts). These traders simply bet that lines will go down because the vibes are off, but don’t have much impact on other financial markets. My inclination, given the evidence I’ve seen, is that Monday’s stock trading experience reflected the latter, rather than the former. However, <strong>it's too early to tell.</strong> Though as of this writing these same banks have experienced stock price gains, so it seems even stock traders today are agreeing with my assessment of their behavior yesterday. Even still, I am not anywhere near confident enough in that hunch to commit to it, and then see regional banks experience fatal runs.<br></p><p>Readers should be able to tell by now that quite a number of issues have been raised by the failure of this one quixotic bank. One piece can’t comprehensively summarize and dissect all these issues. Indeed, I suspect I will be dealing with the events of the past weekend for the next four months, at the very least. However, I can briefly touch on the five issues which have been on my mind the most for the past 100 hours. Some of these observations I will return to at much greater length in the coming days, and weeks.<br></p><p><strong>1) Bank money is money unless it is not money</strong></p><p>Oftentimes in financial writing, financial writers shy away from the biggest topics. It’s hard to tie the big picture issues to current events a lot of the time, and they can seem abstract or abstruse. It’s hard, even for the clearest writers among us, to make these issues seem lively and important. Strangely enough, in this respect, I am very grateful to this mini-episode. The reason is this episode has dramatized my favorite and most abstract topics, three of which I will quickly discuss in this piece.<br><br>The first one is this topic —is a bank deposit money? This might seem like a silly question. Outside of physical cash, bank deposits are the most common form of money we use. We pay off our credit cards, we pay rent or mortgages, and we receive our paychecks in the form of bank deposits. Not only do we use our bank account balances as money, we often use it <em>at par</em>. That simply means that if our credit card bill is 1087 dollars, the credit card company debits our account — at our direction —for the amount of 1087 dollars and the amount is paid off. This point is so basic and simple, many readers will be confused by it out of an assumption that I must be saying something more complicated.<br></p><p>Of course, sometimes making payments out of our bank account involve <em>fees</em>. This interferes with the exact equivalence between different dollar amounts that exist in different forms. However, a fixed fee only minutely separates equivalence between the balance in our bank accounts, and the payments we must incur a fee to make. On a percentage basis, this divergence from “par” may be insignificant. Even the percentage based processing fees charged by many payment processors and credit card companies are small and stable. For example, Stripe is the payment processor which lies behind this newsletter. It charges 2.9% +30 cents. This is sand in the wheels, but it does not disrupt the whole enterprise.<br></p><p>This all might seem far afield from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, but it is not. In some fundamental sense, it's the critical issue. Because bank deposits are not money (at least not fully) to everyone. To you or I, who can’t dream of having anything close to 250 grand in the bank, for all intents and purposes, bank deposits are always money to us. (Rich people, I hope you can forgive me for not writing as if you are my audience. Speeches <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/aboutnathantankus/\">can be more easily tailored to your perspective</a> and concerns). However, to businesses, bank deposits carry risk they have to manage. To businesses, they need to put their excess cash in “alternative” financial assets if they want to be completely assured of safety. <br></p><p>This is why short maturity treasury securities are such useful instruments. You can hold billions of dollars, without taking on the risk of a bank failing. The issue of “shadow banking” also emerges because of uninsured deposits. The siren song of “good collateral” which could back “shadow money”, and thus make it more secure than an uninsured bank deposit calls out to these big depositors. It helps when they are offered a better return. I can’t cover this issue at the length it deserves, here. But it suffices to say the seemingly small issue of uninsured deposits have big implications for the financial structure of the entire global economy. Tackling that issue was one of the things I took on in the monetary policy report I released <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/new-report-monetary-policy-without-interest-rate-hikes/\">early last year</a>.<br></p><p>Some wish that the big Silicon Valley depositors had taken losses. It is true that these balances could have been better managed and these tech businesses seemed to have done little to no due diligence. One of the options available to them was actually a financial technology (“Fintech”) option, that should have excited tech executives. With a system called <a href=\"https://www.aba.com/-/media/documents/webinars/opportunities-for-your-bank-and-safety-for-your-customers-presentation-05222020.pdf?rev=4a715f41b9ac41e7af19320842126e51&ref=crisesnotes.com\">“Insured Cash Sweep”</a>, a large uninsured deposit can be transformed into quite a large number of insured deposits of 250,000 dollars in dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of other banks. All it costs is a fee. This option is available in amounts ranging between 50 million and 150 million dollars. If Silicon Valley Bank had run this system, it might have earned a reasonable amount of fee income, those deposits would have been safe. It then could have avoided holding a large quantity of long maturity securities which it would come to take losses on.<br></p><p>Yet, look at this from another perspective, what purpose does that convoluted system for backing uninsured deposits with insured deposits serve? In some ways, these “brokered” deposits look more like the shadow money issued outside the banking system (or more accurately, outside <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/virtual-currency-in-the-shadows-of/\">the banking subsidiary</a>). In other words, this is just another way of reassuring those with large balances that they have good enough collateral to treat these balances as unconditionally money. What’s unique in this case is that the collateral is simply <em>insured</em> bank deposits. All this nonsense can be eliminated by simply removing the cap on deposit insurance, and admitting that a bank deposit is money, and should just be treated straightforwardly as such. The alternative is treating bank deposits as “fully” money most of the time, except when a crisis hits, or you’re engaging in risk management at a corporate treasury. Meanwhile that ‘risk management”, has all sorts of negative knock on effects.<br><br>Of course, the other reason to avoid fully and unconditionally declaring bank deposits money is that this has big implications. The other situation people like to pretend that bank deposits are not money is when they want to treat bank deposits as a matter of private initiative, and discipline. Rather than acknowledging that banks acquire assets based on the powers granted to them by a bank charter, some would like to pretend they acquire assets on the basis of the discipline, and oversight of uninsured depositors. In this vision the regulations we have are supposed to prevent financial crises, and protect the FDIC’s “insurance fund” which covers insured deposits. But they are not designed with the idea in mind that <em>every asset</em> a bank acquires happens on the back of the full faith and credit of the United States government.<br></p><p>Before this weekend, most people did not see things the way I and my closest colleagues did <em>—</em> even a number of banking law scholars I am friendly with. I still think that my <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/new-report-monetary-policy-without-interest-rate-hikes/\">demand management report from  last year</a> was unique in tying together this perspective with a fully fleshed out framework of just how much we should tighten the rules regulating the quality and quantity of assets that banks can acquire. In the most comprehensive version of this program (as opposed to an alternative “minimal” program), the implications were far reaching and involved bringing those financial institutions deeply reliant on loans and lines of credit from chartered banks into the chartered banking system. Few have gone as far as that “comprehensive” proposal. Yet after the events of this weekend, opinions are clearly quite shaken. The prospect of unlimited deposit insurance, whether de facto or de jure, is leading to a large-scale reconsideration of views among even “moderate” banking scholars. With the remaining embers of the dream of liability side discipline of banking being extinguished, proposals for far tighter asset side regulations will clearly proliferate.<br></p><p>Bringing things full circle, such a comprehensive program could tighten financial conditions throughout the economy. This could reduce aggregate demand without direct effects on interest rates, and certainly with leaving governmental “default risk free” interest rates low. From my perspective, relying much more heavily on direct credit regulation solves the problems posed by fully and unconditionally treating bank deposits as money, and the issue of providing alternative monetary policy tools for managing demand conditions. Two birds, one stone. Uninsured deposits have been a nagging issue hanging over from the last 40 years of banking history. This moment may be just the thing to resolve that issue forever, simplify banking and put an alternative vision of banking and its place in society on the table.<br></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p><strong>2) Central bank collateral policy makes a sudden, splashy return</strong></p><p>I’m not going to be able to devote the time to this issue today that I would like because it's one of the most fundamental issues to come out of this crisis and is an issue I’ve tried to hammer over and over. The flipside of bank runs is the Federal Reserve’s role as a “lender of last resort”, or even simply a lender to banks. This lending typically happens through the “discount window”. As I wrote in 2020, a number of the facilities that the Federal Reserve launches in crises are simply expanding the discount window in ways that they are not authorized to by the part of the Federal Reserve Act which governs the discount window (more pointedly, they may also simply want to keep such temporary expansions <em>separate</em> from the discount window all together). This is one of the most technical and neglected areas of central banking and, until this weekend, it had receded into the background as 2020 moved further into the past.<br></p><p>One of the major issues that discount window discussions center around is the issue of collateral. Central banks have all sorts of choices in what value they can place on the asset used to secure a discount window loan. Recall that collateral is simply an asset that an entity can take ownership of if its debtor defaults. For more discussion of collateral and central bank collateral policy, read this introductory piece <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/central-bank-collateral-policy-monetarypolicy101/\">I wrote in 2020</a>. For the purposes of this discussion all that matters is any asset has three prices, its acquisition price, its market price and its collateral price. To avoid taking losses lenders like to set collateral prices significantly below market prices. The flipside of that choice is that even if there is no stigma to borrowing from the Federal Reserve, there is only so much of your funding you can get from the Federal Reserve. If an asset was acquired for 100 dollars but its collateral price is only 70 dollars, then you need 30 dollars of funding from elsewhere even if you pledge the full value of the asset as collateral for your discount window loan.<br></p><p>Silicon Valley Bank experienced this issue in spades as the market price of its assets had fallen below their acquisition price. The collateral price was, in turn, significantly below that market price. Thus, even if Silicon Valley Bank had begun borrowing from the discount window in large amounts it would not have been enough to cover deposit outflows. Nonetheless, it's still unclear why they did not go to the discount window, though many have pointed out that they began borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Board, which is a kind of “lender of second-to-last resort” and which needs discussion in its own right. What was extraordinary about this weekend is that the announced Bank Term Funding Program is setting collateral prices for securities <em>at acquisition price</em>. This means that you can borrow 100 dollars against an asset you acquired for 100 dollars but which now is worth 50 dollars. If this had existed Wednesday, Silicon Valley Bank would have been able to cover all of its deposit outflows. It’s hard to emphasize how good of a deal that is relative to past conventions around the discount window and Federal Reserve collateral policy.<br></p><p>In a way, this topic is simply another way of discussing the last section. Banks, through their bank charters, are allowed to acquire assets by issuing bank deposits that are treated as money. Any individual creation of bank deposits may lead to a payment outflow that must be covered by the account that bank has, in turn, with the Federal Reserve. But in aggregate, the banking system holds trillions of dollars of assets which are not matched by borrowing at the discount window. Instead, they are matched by the banking deposits that the banking system has issued. In normal times, this is basically irrelevant. Yes, banks periodically have to “compete for deposits” to find funding that is cheaper than interbank borrowing. But the idea that bank asset growth is limited by trigger happy depositors looking for the exit is clearly untrue. Bank runs happen, as we have just seen. But bank runs are not typical and they are the textbook example of when a central bank is supposed to step in. A bank experiencing rapid asset growth may have higher funding costs than banks growing less fast, but it is their high costs which will lead them to slow growth (outside of <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9133.2010.00654.x?ref=crisesnotes.com\">control frauds</a>), not some conception that they “can’t find funding”.<br></p><p>So let's step back for a moment. As I said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NathanTankus/status/1634741021106896897?ref=crisesnotes.com\">on Saturday</a> on twitter “A lot of the discussion this weekend is coming close to accepting @rohangrey's argument that any asset a bank is authorized to make should be acceptable collateral at acquisition price at the discount window.” This point was quickly illustrated by the Federal Reserve’s actions the following day (and quoted <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-03-13/svb-couldn-t-ignore-its-losses-but-the-fed-can?srnd=opinion&ref=crisesnotes.com\">by Matt Levine</a> at Bloomberg on Monday!). When I said this, I didn’t think the Federal Reserve would follow our recommendation <em>in less than 24 hours.</em> If the discount window only has unattractive collateral prices and limited availability when banks mostly don’t need it but expands- either directly or through crisis facilities- when they do, isn’t it kind of like the Federal Reserve is always backstopping banks acquiring and holding those assets? <br></p><p>The difference then, which again goes back to the previous section, is that the “tight” discount window in good times facilitates the fiction that these assets are acquired and held on the back of the volition of private actors, rather than the backing of the United States government. This, in turn, justifies far looser asset side regulations. The alternative, which my colleague Rohan Grey at Williamette University has proposed in detail <a href=\"https://rohangrey.net/files/banking.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">in a book chapter</a> entitled “Banking in a Digital Fiat Currency Regime”, is for all bank assets to be automatically matched with a discount window loan of the same maturity which treats the collateral price as the same as the acquisition price, just as the Federal Reserve did this weekend with its new crisis facility. The chapter is about “digital fiat currency” because proposals for a new digital currency are typically met with concerns over deposit outflow. Many more people holding these balances, far fewer bank deposits and thus less funding for banks.<br></p><p>If you look at the world the way Rohan and I do, deposit outflow as a result of digital fiat currency, <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty-publications/1203/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">bank accounts directly provided by the Federal Reserve</a> to the public and/or postal banking is a <em>feature</em> not a bug. Once we separate and clearly distinguish payments processing from bank lending, we can see that all chartered bank deposits do is paper over the fundamental contradiction between the assets we let banks acquire through their own money creation and the lack of official backstop in good times for holding those assets through direct borrowing from the Federal Reserve. It is absolutely perverse to intentionally weaken new technologies and better payment processing options out of fear of banks “losing deposit funding”. The gap between the terms and quantities that banks can access the discount window and the terms and quantities banks can create bank deposits is a gap measuring the extent to which our financial regulatory and banking regime is lying to both ourselves and each other. Why would we want banks to control payments processing <em>and</em> credit to the non-financial economy? If we can separate these businesses, and we can, then we should.<br></p><p>It should be obvious from the far reaching implications of what we are saying why there are few who fully share our views. Yet, this weekend was again a turning point. It wasn’t Rohan and I who tied fully protecting depositors,  facilitating the holding of bank assets and increasing the collateral price, maturity and availability of Federal Reserve lending. The joint statement from the Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve did that. They have hammered and highlighted the contradiction between what you can fund with uninsured deposits and what you can fund directly with the Federal Reserve and they choose to shrink that gap by expanding the discount window. This weekend has been an almost unbelievable gift to the research agenda we are engaged in.<br></p><p><strong>3) Is there really systemic risk in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank?</strong></p><p>When systemic risk is being discussed, usually it is assumed that we are talking about very broad implications. The Great Financial Crisis was a classic example. What the public was told was “if all the biggest banks in the world fail, the entire global economy is going with them”. Yet it should be obvious that this term is fairly slippery. What exactly does systemic mean? How wide are the consequences of “systemic”? After all, we all exist in a great chain of being, and something that affects one of us affects us all. If you use the definition proffered by the Three Musketeers, any risk at all is a “systemic risk”. <br></p><p>This circumstance is clearly not quite that extreme, but it is also certainly not a cut and dry case of “systemic risk”. Indeed, the prospect that uninsured deposits would be covered in full by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seemed relatively dim. At least, if you followed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StevenKelly49/status/1634662851657728001?ref=crisesnotes.com\">the debate</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MorganRicks1/status/1634695546328981506?ref=crisesnotes.com\">over the</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeterContiBrown/status/1635018251821539329?ref=crisesnotes.com\">weekend</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NathanTankus/status/1634664837941800961?ref=crisesnotes.com\">among the</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ProfKateJudge/status/1634966761123766272?ref=crisesnotes.com\">small set of experts </a>who have both financial system knowledge, and expertise in the legal nuances of the U.S. financial regulatory apparatus. This was precisely because of the legal limitations the FDIC had operated under in the aftermath of the Savings &amp; Loan Crisis. Known as the “least cost” test, it restricts the FDIC from taking actions which will involve greater drawings on the Deposit Insurance Fund. It will not surprise readers to find out that I think this whole schema is a silly <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/improving-the-accounting-gimmicks/\">“accounting gimmick”</a>.<br></p><p>Regardless, the main exemption to the “least cost” rule is known as the “systemic risk” exemption. If not covering those uninsured deposits is legally designated a “systemic risk”, they will cover them. I personally thought that there is more leeway to work around the “least cost” rule in covering uninsured deposits than others expressed, rather than invoking this exemption. But that is more of an irrelevant detail now. They invoked the systemic risk exemption, and here we are.<br></p><p>What is still not clear is what exactly they identified as a systemic risk. In invoking the exemption, they don’t have to say. More to the point, as I am always quick to point out in these circumstances, who has legal standing to challenge their legal interpretation in court? As you can see from the summary above, they didn’t think the entire banking system was in crisis. Does the liquidity situation of a number of regional banks, which may be able to weather this storm in a way Silicon Valley Bank was not, count as a “systemic risk”? The Politico piece also discusses concerns over the fate of two payroll processing companies. <br></p><p>That clearly matters, but if that is enough to have “systemic risk” then we are a long way down from the interconnections feared in the Great Financial Crisis. As we’ll see in the next section, this defining down of systemic risk, or its Federal Reserve Act equivalent, has major implications for how these powers will be used in the future. In this respect, it can be a mistake to get too bogged down in the details of what actions they’ve taken and what knock on effects they discussed over this very busy weekend. The big picture here is that these powers can always be invoked as long as there is a <em>possible effect</em> that can be found which can be characterized as systemic and has a plausibly decent chance of happening. That legal standard is not a standard at all. The restraint is just what actions congress will sanction if taken in the future. That is a very loose standard, to say the least. <br></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe now</a></div><p><strong>4) 13(3) is no longer an emergency authority</strong></p><p>Columbia law professor Lev Menand likes to tease me over extremely nerdy financial regulation dinners about what he sees as my extremely, ahem,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-it-legal-for-the-federal-reserve/\"> “creative”</a> and <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/listen-fed-the-imf-needs-access-to/\">“expansive”</a> interpretation of the Federal Reserve Act. If you read his recent book, <a href=\"https://globalreports.columbia.edu/books/the-fed-unbound/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">“Fed Unbound”</a>, you will understand where he’s coming from. The discretion the Federal Reserve has claimed for itself without much debate is truly staggering. In our conversations I like to emphasize the selectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s legal creativity, rather than its expansiveness. To me what’s far more concerning is <em>who</em> the Federal Reserve gets creative for, rather than the mere fact that it interprets its legal authority widely (rather than narrowly.) A Federal Reserve which pushed the limits of the Federal Reserve act <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/listen-fed-the-imf-needs-access-to/\">on behalf of state and local governments</a> would have produced a more well functioning and less unequal economy over the past forty years.<br></p><p>Yet, <strong>this episode has pushed even my limits.</strong> If you read section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve act, which is the basis for virtually all emergency lending that the Federal Reserve has engaged in since 2007, the key phrase that debates focus on is “unusual and exigent circumstances”. Thus, almost every legal question about the limits and scope of 13(3) hangs on what the legal interpretation of this phrase is. Conventionally, this phrase is taken as a flowery way of saying “emergency”. So the debate shortcuts to what exactly counts as an emergency, which is a familiar issue from other areas of law. One obvious recent example is whether, to what extent and for how long does the global Covid-19 pandemic count as an “emergency”. How big of an event does something have to be to be an emergency?<br></p><p>As we’ve seen in the last section, this latest event has shaken these interpretations to their core. If this is an emergency, then basically any moderately sized event with a knock on effect on the economy is an emergency. In other words, now either everything is an emergency or this is not an emergency power at all. Which interpretation is more accurate is more of a philosophical question than anything else, and has little practical significance. “Unsual and exigent circumstances” seem now to be little more than a day where there was moderately bad weather.</p><p>Part of what colors my thinking about this is that I was, as readers know, a huge advocate of state and local government lending by the Federal Reserve throughout the first two years of the crisis. However, over time I stopped focusing on this point (at least in my day to day writing) because it seemed to me to lose practical relevance with each passing day once the crisis facilities were closed. The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, there is going to be no interest in even <em>listening</em> to a proposal to use state and local government lending powers, let alone to use 13(3) authority to do so. Chairman Powell clearly believes that such a program would even be illegal under today’s circumstances, and would likely say so if asked.<br></p><p>I of course disagree with that legal interpretation, but I have found it hard to muster the effort to argue about it. It seemed pointless to me. But now that the Bank Term Funding Program exists on the basis of 13(3) authority, I am compelled to return to this issue. Because they <em>are</em> invoking 13(3) under these economic circumstances i.e. significant inflation and low unemployment. Not only that, the “emergency” involved here is, at best, very debatable. Before I was battling for a more expansive interpretation of 13(3) which allows use in otherwise very good economic times. Now the Federal Reserve has provided me precedent. Now, they only avoid engaging in state and local government lending because <em>they don’t want to</em>. Because what is an emergency has always been, but definitely is now, simply a matter of taste. Just ask Detroit, or Puerto Rico. <br><br><strong>5) Competition law and Banking. </strong><br></p><p>This is both the last topic I will briefly cover. Flouting tradition, it is also the least important. Competition law in banking is more an intellectual curiosity that I hope to return to in future years. There are many unconfirmed reports that Silicon Valley Bank required its customers who wanted access to loans, or lines of credit to hold all their operating cash with Silicon Valley Bank. The implication of these unconfirmed reports is that these uninsured depositors were compelled to take on this default uncertainty, which exploded over the past week. These kinds of arrangements are called “tying arrangements” in competition law, also known as <a href=\"https://www.uclalawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/securepdfs/2020/07/Paul-67-2.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">“vertical restraints”</a>. Financial regulators in the United States have jurisdiction over what would otherwise be competition law issues, and there are anti-tying financial regulatory laws. However, there are <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.uc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1209&context=fac_pubs&ref=crisesnotes.com\">exemptions to these anti-tying laws</a>. In general this is a good impetus for reexamining those exemptions, and consider narrowing them. Obviously, it's also important to confirm those unconfirmed reports, and find out more details.<br></p><hr><p>That’s all for today, but all these issues need greater examination, and more discussion. In particular, the history of the 1984 failure of the Continental Illinois bank needs to be reviewed and discussed in detail — as well as how that failure changed the FDIC. The Federal Reserve’s discount window and its role in the big picture of banking law needs to be discussed from a wide variety of angles. Financially, the ever-widening meaning of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act will not be going away, not by a long shot. It’s going to be quite an interesting series of weeks as the full implications of this weekend play out. I look forward to covering them for you.<br></p><p><em>This was a free piece of Notes on the Crises.

Thank you for being a paid\nsubscriber.\n\nLately, the 1970s have loomed large in economic commentary, thanks to a\nrecurrence of panic over inflation. History is often invoked in mainstream press\ncoverage about economic policy, which is understandable and can be helpful. But\ntoday I’m going to argue comparisons to the 1970s in contemporary journalism and\npunditry are mostly an example of economic history being done very badly. As\nsoon as even the possibility of high inflation resulting from Covid related\ndisruptions was raised, these comparisons came hard and fast. \n\n\nIn fact, it seems overly generous to even say that your average invocation of\nthe 1970s is bad economic history. In other words, much of this commentary\ndoesn’t pass for even a potted recountation of events fifty years ago. Rarely do\nspecific decisions or contextualized events in “the 1970s” play a significant\nrole in analysis of our contemporary moment. For too much economic commentary,\nthe 1970s are not so much history, but a totem. Go no farther, there lies the\n1970s. \n\n\nOne of the most frustrating aspects of this ahistorical commentary for me is the\ntreatment of Federal Reserve Chairman and business cycle economist Arthur Burns.\nIf all you followed was the commentary on him, you would believe he was a dopey\nand weak radical liberal. A hapless technocrat who nearly led this country to\n“financial ruin”. No one reads Burns’ own writings, references his interviews\ndirectly, or contextualizes his time as Federal Reserve Chairman. At best,\nyou’ll get a brief reference to a speech he made after leaving the Federal\nReserve called “The Anguish of Central Banking”. This is a particularly bizarre\ngap because Burns was Federal Reserve chairman from 1970 to 1978. \n\n\nThe actual Burns was- in his time- a well respected Monetary Policy “Hawk” who\nbelieved deeply in restrictive austerity. This was nearly universally\nacknowledged during his tenure, and then for a few years after. A New York Times\narticle from 1978 about Burns’s successor, George Miller illustrates this well.\nEntitled “Miller Fights Inflation In Arthur Burns's Style”\n[https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/12/archives/miller-fights-inflation-in-arthur-burnss-style-miller-in-burnss.html?searchResultPosition=1]\n, the article argues that Miller tightened monetary policy far more aggressively\nthan the Carter administration expected and spoke in conservative, inflation\nfocused and austere terms. In other words, he was a clone of Arthur Burns. It\nwould bewilder Clyde Farnsworth to know that the political cartoon attached to\nhis article would today be interpreted as criticizing Miller for excessively\nloose monetary policy.\n\n\nThe reason this has been forgotten is the total victory of one influential\ndissenter: Milton Friedman. Milton Friedman, in real time, pilloried his former\nmentor as a money supply expanding inflationist\n[https://digitalcollections.hoover.org/objects/52188/oil-crisis-stock-market-burns-letter-on-monetary-policy?ctx=437da0047860b1d3b215b6577d2d0b99c55bc457&idx=2]\n. That view deserves its own piece sometime (spoiler: it’s mostly wrong.) But\nfor now what’s important is that while Volcker is later seen as validating\nFriedman, that didn’t satisfy the great monetarist himself. Instead, Friedman\ncomplained about Volcker’s “failure” to control the money supply\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-the-volcker-shock-worked-that-sheila-bair-forgot-to-ask/]\n. Without the supposed money supply-inflation link, his claims about Burns\nbecome a lot more suspect. Nonetheless, they are unquestioned history…Even among\npeople who don’t consider themselves monetarists.\n\n\nOf course, policymakers today are not monetarists either. They are not trying\nout controlling the money supply\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-the-volcker-shock-worked-that-sheila-bair-forgot-to-ask/] \n(as Sheila Bair pointed out\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-the-volcker-shock-worked-that-sheila-bair-forgot-to-ask/]\n) — nor are they even claiming to. Instead they are aggressively hiking interest\nrates to attempt to weaken the labor market, and lower wage rate growth. They\nare doing this because they think “in the long run”, faster wage rate growth is\nthe cause of higher inflation. As chairman Powell said at a recent Brookings\nInstitution event\n[https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/es_20221130_powell_transcript.pdf]\n: “To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing, but for wage growth to be\nsustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2% inflation”.\n\n\nBurns talked in these exact same terms\n[https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/meltzer/burref78.pdf] about wage\ngrowth: “To the extent that wage increases outrun gains in productivity,\nbusiness costs— and ultimately consumer prices— are driven up”. In fact, even\nthe same accounting identity relating productivity, wage growth and inflation\nled to the 2%-3% “inflation target”\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/premium-transcript-notes-on-the-crises-podcast-4-daniel-mitchell-chief-economist-of-nixons-pay-board/] \nof Nixon’s wage and price controls (that’s a topic I will return to later). He\nwas obsessed with wage growth, and saw its “explosive” form as the core threat\nto price stability — just as Powell’s Fed does today. This is certainly not an\narea where you could find a dime’s worth of difference between Powell and Burns.\n\n\nOne part of the fantasy Arthur Burns which has been added by pundits in recent\nyears is that he is alleged to not take “inflation expectations” seriously.\nSupposedly, along with most policymakers or experts in the early 1970s, Burns\njust didn’t consider inflation a high priority. According to this account, Burns\ndidn’t preemptively tighten monetary policy because he simply didn’t understand\nthe importance of getting inflation expectations under control. Today's\nenlightened policymakers understand that, which is why policy is so much\n“better” today. Hooray for progress! \n\n\nExcept, this narrative is… questionable, to say the least.\n\n\nIn fact, my main motivation for writing this piece came from how bizarre this\nnarrative is, when compared to reading literally any of Arthur Burns actual\nwritings and speeches. There are few people in the history of economic thought\nwho have obsessed more over the expectations of businessmen and households than\nArthur Burns. His late 1960s and early 1970s commentary is shot through with a\ndeep, perhaps even obsessive, focus on “inflationary psychology”. True he rarely\nused the phrase “inflation expectations” (if at all). But there’s more than one\nway to refer to an important topic, and the economic meaning in his writing is\nidentical. To take an example, almost from random, from congressional testimony\nin November 1971 [https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/meltzer/burref78.pdf]\n:\n\n> In part, the cost pressures stemmed from efforts by workers and their trade\nunions to compensate for the eroding impact of past price increases on their\nreal earnings. But they also reflected the efforts of labor to anticipate future\nprice increases. Both labor and management came to expect that inflation would\npersist, and that it might become our way of life. In this environment, labor\ntypically demanded large wage increases, and business firms typically met these\ndemands in the belief that higher costs could be passed on in the form of higher\nprices. As the pace of inflation quickened, expectations of continuing inflation\nbegan to dominate economic decision making”\nThis is no isolated example. His commentary is filled with passages like this,\nshowing inflation expectations to be a sustained concern of his thinking.\nClaiming Arthur Burns didn’t focus on inflation expectations is the intellectual\nequivalent of saying Milton Friedman didn’t focus on the money supply.\n\n\nSo how did the Burns era actually differ from Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve?\nOne is intellectual, the other historical. \n\n\nIntellectually, Burns didn’t think restrictive monetary policy was enough to\ncontrol inflation expectations. One reason was that he thought that fiscal\npolicy and non-financial regulation had much bigger impacts on inflation\nexpectations than monetary policy. And certainly was more relevant to the stated\nplans (forward guidance) of monetary policy. The latest evidence tells us he was \nright [https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/35/4/1597/6322971] about that\n[https://www.apricitas.io/p/understanding-inflation-expectations]. \n\n\nBurns also emphasized that “inflationary psychology” had counteracting effects\nin that higher and more uncertain inflation expectations. Expectations of higher\ninflation are also commonly associated with a declining economic outlook, which\ncan discourage spending (and wage demands). As economics writer Joey Politano\npointed out, this is also something suggested by the best evidence we have today\n[https://www.apricitas.io/p/understanding-inflation-expectations]. Most\ncritically though, he thought that the collective bargaining decisions of labor\nunions were insensitive to overall economic conditions.\n\nWhich brings us to the historical difference between the early 1970s and today:\nUnions. The number of unionized private sector employees relative to total\nprivate sector employment was far higher then. Union density has fallen\ndramatically since Burns’s career\n[https://www.epi.org/unequalpower/publications/private-sector-unions-corporate-legal-erosion/]\n. In fact, it's close to dead today. In 1970 private sector union density was\n29.1%. In 2019 it was 6.2%. Even these incredible numbers understate the story. \nUnions at that time had strong influence over their employers and economic (and\nlegal) conditions required treating them as an important, and feared,\nstakeholder in many sectors throughout the economy.\n\n\nEven a matter of years later, both economic and legal conditions had changed. \nThat union density had fallen to 20.1% by 1980 and the legal environment on\neverything from unemployment insurance, Aid to Families with Dependent Children\n(AFDC), to the NLRB and deregulation had changed. Even state policies that had\nbeen generous in the late 1960s to early 1970s were radically rolled back.\nPerhaps most importantly, unions in goods producing industries became subject to\nfar more international economic pressure and coercion than they had in earlier\ndecades. By any possible measure unions (in general) have less leverage over the\naverage employer today. That’s actually true even in many circumstances when\nthey make up a large proportion of an employer’s employees.\n\n\nThe point is that the role of labor unions in the wider economy was far\ndifferent at the beginning of the 1970s and Burns conceptually understood that\nit was different. In these circumstances Burns thought controlling inflation\nrequired direct intervention in the collective bargaining process. That wasn’t a\nliberal orthodoxy: he was thinking like businessmen, economists and most\npolicymakers of his day. In fact, while it seems far fetched today, wage and\nprice controls were a common business proposal at the beginning of the 1970s.\nMonetarist Historian and former Richmond Federal Reserve economist Robert Hetzel\nlays this out clearly in an oral interview\n[https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/historical/hetzel_interviews/wojnilower_a_20020829.pdf] \nwith legendary private sector economist Albert Wojnilower:\n\n\n> Robert L. Hetzel: Well, at that time, it was—well, for example, in 1970, Robert\nRosa gave a speech at the whatever the finance association is, and he argued for\na six-month wage freeze to change psychology. And that’s what people like\nVolcker and Weidenbaum, who is a very conservative person, that was the common\nview; that there was an inflation mentality that had to be stopped, and the way\nto stop the psychology was for freeze for six months. [...] Burns, ever since he\nwas head of the NBER, sat on a lot of corporate boards. Like Greenspan, he would\nsort of be a business forecaster. I think it was a lucrative thing for him. And\nhe always thought he had an insight into the psychology of the businessman, and\na lot of his ideas really reflect to the conventional views of the business\ncommunity at the time. And I think that’s where they came from, because the\nbusiness community was very much in favor of controls. When they said\n“controls,” they mean wage controls and price controls \n\n> Albert Wojnilower: Absolutely. You’ve got that totally right. And it was a great\nirony at that time that the business community were the ones who pushed this\nidea, which I suspect a lot of researchers or people who talk about this\nhistory, would like to overlook when they talk about it.\nWhat that means is that conventional wisdom appears completely backwards. Rather\nthan ignoring inflation expectations, the obsession with inflation expectations\nled Burns and other policymakers to use a tool of non-financial regulation to\ndirectly stabilize wages and prices. They did that in order to reduce inflation\nexpectations, and thus inflation. They were clearly egged on by both the\nbusiness community and even the labor movement (which had long endorsed price\ncontrols).\n\n\nGiven the international experience with stabilizing wages in highly unionized\neconomies, and the fact that the Volcker shock only “succeeded” in a rapidly\ndeunionizing and already changing economic and legal environment, modern\nconventional wisdom appears extremely suspect. The idea that Chairman Burns\ncould or should have “just done a Volcker”  falls apart under even minimal\nexamination. Economic, political and legal conditions were totally different at\nthe beginning of the 1970s than at the end. Burns had no choice but to try to\nfind a path to full employment and lower measured inflation within the\nconstraint of a much more unionized and formidable private labor force. Indeed,\none way of understanding the political shift rightwards during the 1970s is as a\nresponse by political elites and businessmen to having to make decisions with\nconsideration of labor union power under more adverse economic conditions. All\nof this is true and I have not even touched on the financial stability concerns\nwhich reinforced Burns’s decision to take a self-described “middle path” on\nrestricting aggregate demand.\n\n\nOf course, wage and price controls didn’t succeed to stabilize inflation. I\nwrote about this topic over the summer\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/dont-let-dick-cheney-ruin-price-regulation-too/].\nBut in the context of Arthur Burns, my argument in that piece takes on new\nlight. The obsession with inflation expectations which Burns shares with Powell \npoints us in the wrong direction. Wage and price controls did get inflation\nexpectations under control. Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAs) in collective\nbargaining contracts collapsed. Prices nonetheless shot up as soon as decontrol\nset in. Inflation expectations weren’t determinative of actual price increases.\nPricing power, rather than price expectations, were what mattered then.

Their obsession with wages. The chief example of “explosive wage\ngrowth” to Burns and his business interlocutors was the growth in construction\nwages. In fact, they were so alarmed by them that Nixon implemented \nconstruction\nunion specific wage controls in March 1972\n[https://iro.uiowa.edu/esploro/outputs/book/Wars-of-attrition-Vietnam-the-business/9983557659202771]\n, five months before general wage and price controls.

Meanwhile today even prominent Federal Reserve official Lael Brainard is\nbringing up the role of profit margins\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20220907a.htm]. That\nimplies the potential (though not guaranteed\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/prices-prices-prices-almost-everything-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-too-annoyed-to-ask/]\n) role of pricing power in inflation today. \n\n\nIf Powell is wrong, then corporate pricing power (or even simply pricing power\nin housing and a smattering of other “regulated industry” sectors) can sustain\nabove target inflation. That means even if wages forcefully decelerate, we will\nsee severe problems.

But it will be an accident. \nPowell is operating with the same playbook that Burns was… He just doesn’t have\nto read the chapters related to a heavily unionized labor market. Most troubling\nthough is that Federal Reserve officials still talk as if workers have lots of\nbargaining power. As my guest Daniel Mitchell\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/premium-transcript-notes-on-the-crises-podcast-4-daniel-mitchell-chief-economist-of-nixons-pay-board/] \nwrote in a paper entitled “Not Yet Dead at the Fed”\n[https://escholarship.org/content/qt62h197fw/qt62h197fw_noSplash_5b15010b9e85dc94a813f045c5dee6c4.pdf]\n, Federal Reserve transcripts are filled with labor bargaining language, despite\nthe lack of private sector unions. Even when you consider all the pandemic\ndisruptions, this has made the Federal Reserve’s job a lot easier than the job\nArthur Burns’ Federal Reserve had. Jerome Powell is acting like an Arthur Burns\nclone- that just makes him a monetary policy hawk, not a dove.\nIn short, read more Arthur Burns, and less “whig” history.\n\nPrinter Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/12XtYPi26We6W-ol_8Ku1MVFRIr4SJ2cb/view?usp=sharing]","html":"<p><em>This is a premium piece of Notes on the Crises. Thank you for being a paid subscriber.</em></p><p>Lately, the 1970s have loomed large in economic commentary, thanks to a recurrence of panic over inflation. History is often invoked in mainstream press coverage about economic policy, which is understandable and can be helpful. But today I’m going to argue comparisons to the 1970s in contemporary journalism and punditry are<strong> mostly an example of economic history being done very badly.</strong> As soon as even the possibility of high inflation resulting from Covid related disruptions was raised, these comparisons came hard and fast. <br></p><p>In fact, it seems overly generous to even say that your average invocation of the 1970s is bad economic history. In other words, much of this commentary doesn’t pass for even a potted recountation of events fifty years ago. Rarely do specific decisions or contextualized events in “the 1970s” play a significant role in analysis of our contemporary moment.<strong> For too much economic commentary, the 1970s are not so much history, but a totem. </strong>Go no farther, there lies the 1970s. <br></p><p>One of the most frustrating aspects of this ahistorical commentary for me is the treatment of Federal Reserve Chairman and business cycle economist Arthur Burns. If all you followed was the commentary on him, you would believe he was a dopey and weak radical liberal. A hapless technocrat who nearly led this country to “financial ruin”.<strong> No one reads Burns’ own writings, references his interviews directly, or contextualizes his time as Federal Reserve Chairman. </strong>At best, you’ll get a brief reference to a speech he made after leaving the Federal Reserve called <strong>“The Anguish of Central Banking”.</strong> This is a particularly bizarre gap because Burns was Federal Reserve chairman from 1970 to 1978.<strong> </strong><br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vG4WHft0QtMGn2is_MX8rZgZRG6KURdUn-pY9_kfQoOQd_Jo9cvqnK2J9DVoFT4U_IR3-Gua2yxnOUdEsop63B_Tyt5Cf7Zu8rMsgTBMorLQo9MAgIqmUOSHRlmkdmJAdF9L8HYaghRkJurSLaYpowyMnUcfSsQ2vMMtBTHHMB9DAc8GoGagsnzXdFrE4w\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>The actual Burns was- in his time- a well respected Monetary Policy “Hawk” who believed deeply in restrictive austerity. This was nearly universally acknowledged during his tenure, and then for a few years after. A New York Times article from 1978 about Burns’s successor, George Miller illustrates this well. Entitled <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/12/archives/miller-fights-inflation-in-arthur-burnss-style-miller-in-burnss.html?searchResultPosition=1&ref=crisesnotes.com\">“Miller Fights Inflation In Arthur Burns's Style”</a>, the article argues that Miller tightened monetary policy far more aggressively than the Carter administration expected and spoke in conservative, inflation focused and austere terms. In other words, he was a clone of Arthur Burns. It would bewilder Clyde Farnsworth to know that the political cartoon attached to his article would today be interpreted as criticizing Miller for excessively loose monetary policy.  <br></p><p>The reason this has been forgotten is the total victory of one influential dissenter: Milton Friedman. Milton Friedman, in real time, pilloried his former mentor <a href=\"https://digitalcollections.hoover.org/objects/52188/oil-crisis-stock-market-burns-letter-on-monetary-policy?ctx=437da0047860b1d3b215b6577d2d0b99c55bc457&idx=2&ref=crisesnotes.com\">as a money supply expanding inflationist</a>. That view deserves its own piece sometime (spoiler: it’s mostly wrong.) But for now what’s important is that while Volcker is later seen as validating Friedman,<strong> that didn’t satisfy the great monetarist himself.</strong> Instead, Friedman complained about <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-the-volcker-shock-worked-that-sheila-bair-forgot-to-ask/\">Volcker’s “failure” to control the money supply</a>. Without the supposed money supply-inflation link, his claims about Burns become a lot more suspect. Nonetheless, <strong>they are unquestioned history…Even among people who don’t consider themselves monetarists.</strong><br></p><p>Of course, policymakers today are not monetarists either. They are not trying out <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-the-volcker-shock-worked-that-sheila-bair-forgot-to-ask/\">controlling the money supply</a> (as<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-the-volcker-shock-worked-that-sheila-bair-forgot-to-ask/\"> Sheila Bair pointed out</a>) — nor are they even claiming to.<strong> Instead they are aggressively hiking interest rates to attempt to weaken the labor market,</strong> and lower wage rate growth. They are doing this because they think “in the long run”, faster wage rate growth is the cause of higher inflation. As chairman Powell said at a recent <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/es_20221130_powell_transcript.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Brookings Institution event</a>: “To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing, <strong>but</strong> for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2% inflation”.<br></p><p>Burns talked in these <a href=\"https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/meltzer/burref78.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">exact same terms</a> about wage growth: “To the extent that wage increases outrun gains in productivity, business costs— and ultimately consumer prices— are driven up”. In fact, even the same accounting identity relating productivity, wage growth and inflation led to the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/premium-transcript-notes-on-the-crises-podcast-4-daniel-mitchell-chief-economist-of-nixons-pay-board/\">2%-3% “inflation target”</a> of Nixon’s wage and price controls (that’s a topic I will return to later). <strong>He was obsessed with wage growth, </strong>and saw its “explosive” form as the core threat to price stability — just as Powell’s Fed does today. This is certainly not an area where you could find a dime’s worth of difference between Powell and Burns.<br></p><p>One part of the fantasy Arthur Burns which has been added by pundits in recent years is that he is alleged to not take “inflation expectations” seriously. Supposedly, along with most policymakers or experts in the early 1970s, Burns just didn’t consider inflation a high priority. According to this account, Burns didn’t preemptively tighten monetary policy because he simply didn’t understand the importance of getting inflation expectations under control. Today's enlightened policymakers understand that, which is why policy is so much “better” today. Hooray for progress! <br></p><p>Except, this narrative is… <strong>questionable</strong>, to say the least.<br></p><p>In fact, my main motivation for writing this piece came from how bizarre this narrative is, when compared to reading literally any of Arthur Burns actual writings and speeches. There are few people in the history of economic thought who have obsessed more over the expectations of businessmen and households than Arthur Burns. His late 1960s and early 1970s commentary is shot through with a deep, perhaps even obsessive, focus on “inflationary psychology”. True he rarely used the phrase “inflation expectations” (if at all). But there’s more than one way to refer to an important topic, and the economic meaning in his writing is identical. To take an example, almost from random, <a href=\"https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/meltzer/burref78.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">from congressional testimony in November 1971</a>:</p><blockquote>In part, the cost pressures stemmed from efforts by workers and their trade unions to compensate for the eroding impact of past price increases on their real earnings. But they also reflected the efforts of labor to <strong>anticipate future price increases</strong>. Both labor and management <strong>came to expect</strong> that inflation would persist, and that it might become our way of life. In this environment, labor typically demanded large wage increases, and business firms typically met these demands in the belief that higher costs could be passed on in the form of higher prices. As the pace of inflation quickened, <strong>expectations of continuing inflation began to dominate</strong> economic decision making”</blockquote><p>This is no isolated example. His commentary is <strong>filled </strong>with passages like this, showing inflation expectations to be a sustained concern of his thinking. Claiming Arthur Burns <strong>didn’t focus on inflation expectations</strong> is the intellectual equivalent of <strong>saying Milton Friedman didn’t focus on the money supply.</strong><br></p><p>So how did the Burns era actually differ from Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve? One is <strong>intellectual</strong>, the other <strong>historical</strong>. <br></p><p>Intellectually, Burns didn’t think restrictive monetary policy was enough to control inflation expectations. One reason was that he thought that fiscal policy and non-financial regulation had <strong>much bigger impacts on inflation expectations than monetary policy</strong>. And certainly was more relevant to the stated plans (forward guidance) of monetary policy. The latest evidence tells us he was <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/35/4/1597/6322971?ref=crisesnotes.com\">right</a> <a href=\"https://www.apricitas.io/p/understanding-inflation-expectations?ref=crisesnotes.com\">about that</a>. <br></p><p>Burns also emphasized that “inflationary psychology” had counteracting effects in that higher and more uncertain inflation expectations. Expectations of higher inflation are also commonly associated with a declining economic outlook, which can discourage spending (and wage demands). As economics writer Joey Politano pointed out, this is also something suggested by the best evidence <a href=\"https://www.apricitas.io/p/understanding-inflation-expectations?ref=crisesnotes.com\">we have today</a>. Most critically though, he thought that <strong>the collective bargaining decisions of labor unions were insensitive to overall economic conditions.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pyOGJ0ii67x7fBOeg-CBc6pB-RWT_DC4vUL8qJ38seE58u68T7Rxi4qhQm8qhtXSDp7iOAALDm3gVTzYgRRkYPj9ois2dGhea8X2vV7fhS9g5TtD7niA_9XCJawDmjoB4oGhrbztrCvL1qlx2RZ9H24k2N4ddJR9iWnsKKVCsz4hP2JnhZuusTpxpubwQA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Which brings us to the historical difference between the early 1970s and today: Unions. The number of unionized private sector employees relative to total private sector employment was far higher then. Union density <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/unequalpower/publications/private-sector-unions-corporate-legal-erosion/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">has fallen dramatically since Burns’s career</a>. In fact,<strong> it's close to dead today.</strong> In 1970 private sector union density was 29.1%. In 2019 it was 6.2%. Even these incredible numbers<strong> understate the story.</strong> Unions at that time had strong influence over their employers and economic (and legal) conditions required treating them as an important, and feared, stakeholder in many sectors throughout the economy.<br></p><p><strong>Even a matter of years later, both economic and legal conditions had changed.</strong> That union density had fallen to 20.1% by 1980 and the legal environment on everything from unemployment insurance, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), to the NLRB and deregulation had changed. Even state policies that had been generous in the late 1960s to early 1970s were radically rolled back. Perhaps most importantly,<strong> unions in goods producing industries became subject to far more international economic pressure and coercion</strong> than they had in earlier decades. By any possible measure unions (in general) <strong>have less leverage over the average employer today. </strong>That’s actually true even in many circumstances when they make up a large proportion of an employer’s employees.<br></p><p>The point is that the role of labor unions in the wider economy was far different at the beginning of the 1970s and <em>Burns conceptually understood that it was different.</em> In these circumstances Burns thought controlling inflation required direct intervention in the collective bargaining process. That wasn’t a liberal orthodoxy:<strong> he was thinking like businessmen, economists and most policymakers of his day. </strong>In fact, while it seems far fetched today, wage and price controls were a common business proposal at the beginning of the 1970s. Monetarist Historian and former Richmond Federal Reserve economist Robert Hetzel lays this out clearly in <a href=\"https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/historical/hetzel_interviews/wojnilower_a_20020829.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">an oral interview</a> with legendary private sector economist Albert Wojnilower:<br></p><blockquote><strong>Robert L. Hetzel:</strong> Well, at that time, it was—well, for example, in 1970, Robert Rosa gave a speech at the whatever the finance association is, and he argued for a six-month wage freeze to change psychology. And that’s what people like Volcker and Weidenbaum, who is a very conservative person, that was the common view; that there was an inflation mentality that had to be stopped, and the way to stop the psychology was for freeze for six months. [...] Burns, ever since he was head of the NBER, sat on a lot of corporate boards. Like Greenspan, he would sort of be a business forecaster. I think it was a lucrative thing for him. And he always thought he had an insight into the psychology of the businessman, and a lot of his ideas really reflect to the conventional views of the business community at the time. And I think that’s where they came from, because the business community was very much in favor of controls. When they said “controls,” they mean wage controls and price controls <br></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Albert Wojnilower:</strong> Absolutely. You’ve got that totally right. And it was a great irony at that time that the business community were the ones who pushed this idea, which I suspect a lot of researchers or people who talk about this history, would like to overlook when they talk about it.</blockquote><p>What that means is that <strong>conventional wisdom appears completely backwards. </strong>Rather than ignoring inflation expectations, the obsession with inflation expectations led Burns and other policymakers to <strong>use a tool of non-financial regulation to directly stabilize wages and prices. </strong>They did that in order to reduce inflation expectations, and thus inflation. They were clearly egged on by both the business community and even the labor movement (which had long endorsed price controls).<br></p><p>Given the international experience with stabilizing wages in highly unionized economies, and the fact that the Volcker shock only “succeeded” in a rapidly deunionizing and already changing economic and legal environment, <strong>modern conventional wisdom appears extremely suspect</strong>. The idea that Chairman Burns could or should have “just done a Volcker”  falls apart under even minimal examination. Economic, political and legal conditions were totally different at the beginning of the 1970s than at the end. Burns had no choice but to try to find a path to full employment and lower measured inflation <strong>within the constraint</strong> of a much more unionized and formidable private labor force. Indeed, one way of understanding the political shift rightwards during the 1970s is as a response by political elites and businessmen to having to make decisions with consideration of labor union power under more adverse economic conditions. All of this is true and I have not even touched on the financial stability concerns which reinforced Burns’s decision to take a self-described “middle path” on restricting aggregate demand.<br></p><p>Of course, wage and price controls<strong> didn’t succeed to stabilize inflation. </strong>I wrote about this topic over <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/dont-let-dick-cheney-ruin-price-regulation-too/\">the summer</a>.

They all were important, but the change\nattracting the most attention was canceling ten thousand dollars of student debt\nof each borrower who made less than one hundred and twenty five thousand\ndollars. They also canceled an additional ten thousand dollars for each student\ndebtor who was a Pell Grant recipient. Among other things, this announcement is\nimportant because canceling all student debt has been a key demand of many\nactivists. Cancelation began as a demand of Occupy Wall Street’s “Strike Debt”\n[https://strikedebt.org/is-strike-debt-still-active/], a predecessor to the\n“union of debtors” called the Debt Collective [https://debtcollective.org/]. It\nis well known that I’m an advocate of full student debt cancellation, but\ntoday’s piece will not be about why I think that’s a good idea. Instead, I want\nto focus on an analytical point which I think is being seriously overlooked. \n\nNamely: student debt cancellation is not a subsidy to higher education. The\nsubsidy to higher education comes from student loan credit. What is the\ndifference between student loan credit and student loan debt? Everything.\n\n\nLet’s start at the most basic level. A person who is interested in going to\ncollege but is not yet in college does not start out in student debt. They send\napplications to prospective schools, and at the same time they fill out the Free\nApplication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This application tells students how\nmuch of a Pell Grant they qualify for, based on their parents’ income (or their\nown income if they are older than 23, or have some other qualifying reason that\nmakes them an “independent student''). It also tells them how much student\ncredit they qualify for. They go through this application process every year.\n\n\nWhen those loans are taken out — i.e. when they tap their student credit — they\nget an asset, a bank deposit, and a liability, their student debt. They may not\neven directly receive that bank deposit. Instead, it might go directly to the\nschool or university they are attending. In either case, some large portion (in\nmany, many cases, all of it) of that student credit becomes income to the\nschool, or university they are attending. Even what does not go to the school\nis, in a larger sense, a subsidy to higher education. That’s because those\nstudents need to cover their basic living expenses, in order to be able to\ncontinue attending school.\n\n\nFor more on terminology used here, read this\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-government-always-money/]\nFrom the moment that students pay their tuition (and possibly room and board)\nwith the proceeds from their student loan, the university has received the\nsubsidy they get from the student loan credit program. The student now has a\ndebt load but very soon after, maybe even instantaneously, after the loan is\nmade the student credits have parted ways from the student debt. The Student is\nleft with debt, and the school is left with income. If this were simply a direct\nsubsidy paid out to schools for providing students education, everything would\nbe the same — except the student would not have debt, and this transaction would\nbe officially booked as government spending. However, the school’s income would\nbe exactly the same. \n\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]One way to think about\nthis is to imagine that an administrator in the Bursar department of some\nuniversity meets at the fork of a road with an incoming student. Suddenly\nsomeone from the department of education drives up. They hand the student a big\nbag of money labeled “student credit”, and tell the student “you owe us now”.\nAfter they drive away, the student hands the bag of money to the administrator.\nThe administrator goes down the road towards the rainbows, while the student\ngoes down the road towards the thunderclouds. They now have nothing to do with\neach other. They are going down different roads.

They are, after all, choosing to go to school. At least at the\nbeginning of the process, they have some sort of belief that this is going to\nmake their lives better. But the benefit they receive from student loans is\ncertainly not anywhere near equivalent to the face value of the loan, let alone\nthe interest bearing payments they will need to make for many years to come.\nMeanwhile, the benefit that universities are receiving from the student loan\ncredit program is something near the amount of student loans made each year —\ni.e. the fraction that becomes its income.\n\n\nWhen most members of the public (we’ll get to the economists in a second) say\nthat student debt cancellation is a “subsidy to higher education” I think they\nare envisioning that cancellation means that all that money retroactively \nbecomes a subsidy.

I think the public reaction to cancellation actually happening is illustrating\nthat it has made people much more aware that higher education has deep problems.\nIt’s now clear that higher ed needs to be regulated much more vigorously, since\nwe’ve been handing its more than many billions more dollars each year than we\nrealized.\n\n\n\n\nI know there are economists reading this who think what I’m saying is obtuse.\nThey are bubbling over with the sentiment that I just do not understand.\nSpecifically, they do not care about the past\n[https://twitter.com/nomadj1s/status/1562919845750083584] (which is what the\npiece so far has been about). To these economists, what is significant is\nlooking to the future. So when I say that student debt cancellation isn’t a\nsubsidy to higher education because it was the student loan credit which became\nhigher education’s income, they get frustrated. They think to themselves: “Yes,\nbut this is going to get more people to attend college in the future”. More\nprecisely, students may take into consideration that their debts will simply be\ncanceled and take out more student loans than they otherwise would and attend\nhigher tuition schools than they otherwise would. \n\nI think this sort of response is misguided for two reasons. First, it overrates\nthe “forward looking” behavior of college students. Morespecifically, it makes\nthe possibility that there will be a convenient Democratic Party administration,\nwho is willing to cancel more student debt a far more predictable eventuality\nthan it is. The people in their twenties who I know are much more likely to be\nindifferent to taking on student loans, whether because of future climate\ncatastrophe, or the Republican party successfully ending democracy than faith in\na future Democratic administration. \n\n\nSecond, and more fundamentally, this response misses that even if students tap\ngreater amounts of student credit in the future, it is still the student loan\ncredit program that is providing the subsidy. Without the program, cancellation\nwould have no avenue for influencing future student’s behavior. Student debt\ncancellation may induce significantly more people to seek college — though I am\ndoubtful. But either way, it's still the credit program providing the subsidy.\nFurthermore, the vast, vast majority of this subsidy was going to go out the\ndoor, whether student debt was canceled or not. \n\n\n\n\nFinally, it is much more likely that another change the Biden administration\nannounced will induce greater student attendance than outright cancellation —\nchanges to the Income-Based Repayment program.\n[https://www.americanprogress.org/article/proposed-student-loan-repayment-plan-would-extend-the-same-income-based-terms-to-all-federal-loan-borrowers/] \nSince the mid-90s a series of successive administrations — making it a\nbipartisan project- have introduced increasingly “generous” programs for making\nstudent debt payments based on income rather than debt loads.

They all were important, but the change attracting the most attention was canceling ten thousand dollars of student debt of each borrower who made less than one hundred and twenty five thousand dollars. They also canceled an additional ten thousand dollars for each student debtor who was a Pell Grant recipient. Among other things, this announcement is important because canceling all student debt has been a key demand of many activists. Cancelation began as a demand of Occupy Wall Street’s <a href=\"https://strikedebt.org/is-strike-debt-still-active/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">“Strike Debt”</a>, a predecessor to the “union of debtors” called the<a href=\"https://debtcollective.org/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> Debt Collective</a>. It is well known that I’m an advocate of full student debt cancellation, but today’s piece will not be about why I think that’s a good idea. Instead, I want to focus on an analytical point which I think is being seriously overlooked. <br><br>Namely: student debt cancellation is not a subsidy to higher education. The subsidy to higher education comes from student loan <em>credit</em>. What is the difference between student loan credit and student loan debt? <strong>Everything.</strong><br></p><p>Let’s start at the most basic level. A person who is interested in going to college but is not yet in college does not start out in student debt. They send applications to prospective schools, and at the same time they fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This application tells students how much of a Pell Grant they qualify for, based on their parents’ income (or their own income if they are older than 23, or have some other qualifying reason that makes them an “independent student''). It also tells them how much student credit they qualify for. They go through this application process every year.<br></p><p>When those loans are taken out — i.e. when they tap their <em>student credit —</em> they get an asset, a bank deposit, and a liability, their student debt. They may not even directly receive that bank deposit. Instead, it might go directly to the school or university they are attending. In either case, some large portion (in many, many cases, all of it) of that student credit becomes income to the school, or university they are attending. Even what does not go to the school is, in a larger sense, <strong>a subsidy to higher education.</strong> That’s because those students need to cover their basic living expenses, in order to be able to continue attending school.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/H4ES9qpAN5Kc1CQn5IhQ7XWiKhrtXhEbhbfswCPdbQCY_Te2f-SkSHdbGGOBPzc_ds_U6kUS3jOR2_WhPICoQQdBQofKOctoLuvmAmTcDx51BRaGSRWM0XGVujG1SqePbuMXXLTfEhKTdzgpQFremqk\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>For more on terminology used here, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-government-always-money/\">read this</a></figcaption></figure><p><br>From the moment that students pay their tuition (and possibly room and board) with the proceeds from their student loan,<strong> the university has received the subsidy they get from the student loan credit program</strong>. The student now has a debt load but very soon after, maybe even instantaneously, after the loan is made the student <em>credits</em> have parted ways from the <em>student debt</em>. The Student is left <strong>with debt,</strong> and the school is left <strong>with income.</strong> If this were simply a direct subsidy paid out to schools for providing students education, everything would be the same — except the student would not have debt, and this transaction would be officially booked as government spending. However, the school’s income would be <strong>exactly the same. </strong><br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-AyelQZejZRfWDAk3o7F4nLMyITJ0NHJvvF-PxKzMUCxnaWrs-Du9LfZ5l6EaTgjeZp082dHo3hrYlPp7jt3_o9oUfYNxCM9xFHsPh3K_72RVVx08Wz04cECmHS4yrBUalzZexKb21JuHScsPtinymQ\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>One way to think about this is to imagine that an administrator in the Bursar department of some university meets at the fork of a road with an incoming student. Suddenly someone from the department of education drives up. They hand the student a big bag of money labeled “student credit”, and tell the student “you owe us now”. After they drive away, the student hands the bag of money to the administrator. The administrator goes down the road towards the rainbows, while the student goes down the road towards the thunderclouds. They now have nothing to do with each other. They are going down different roads. If 10 years down the road(s) the department of education calls and says “wow it really has been stormy down that road, so we’re canceling your debt”, it <strong>has no impact on the administrator</strong>  — who is in the land of rainbows and sunshine. <br></p><p>None of this means that students don’t get any benefits from the proceeds of student loans.

To\nbriefly summarize, the Biden administration committed to further emptying the\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. At  the same time, they committed to buying oil\nover the next few years, at specified minimum prices. Depending on your point of\nview, the timing of my piece was either perfect or extremely bad. The very next\nday the world was caught off guard by a surprise deal between Senate Majority\nLeader Chuck Schumer, and habitual enfant terrible Joe Manchin. \n\n\nSchumer and Manchin’s fiscal deal, amusingly named the “Inflation Reduction\nAct”, is far smaller than the original Build Back Better proposal. It is also\nmuch smaller than the cut down proposals people tried to get Manchin to accede\nto. But it is still something, and better than nothing. It also has a number of\nclimate provisions, but also Oil and Gas provisions. A colleague of mine\ndescribed it as a “quarter of a loaf” — and I am still deciding whether I would\neven be that generous. Nonetheless, it is something at a time when it seemed\nlike there might not be any further fiscal action at all.\n\n\nEver since both announcements came down I have been trying to formulate what I\nthink about both issues. In particular, I have a strong sense that these are\ndeeply related topics.  My issues with both Employ America’s proposal and the\nInflation Reduction Act are deeply intertwined, but it has been difficult to\narticulate. At their core, both policy shifts indicate an emerging approach to\nclimate change that emphasizes growing both the fossil fuel and renewable energy\nindustries in the near term, and crucially only phasing out fossil fuel\nproduction when it is convenient. This is a policy which involves no disruptions\nwhich will need to be managed. In this view, emissions are purely “induced” by\nthe demand for goods and services. They don’t involve particular production\nchoices by fossil fuel businesses themselves.\n\n\nBefore diving into my problems with this perspective, I want to speak to one\ntype of criticism I got from readers after my EA piece. I have many, many\nreaders who are interested in my financial markets analysis, and maybe even some\nof my macroeconomic analysis but who think I should stay out of topics like\nclimate change. That will not be happening. \n\n\nUltimately, the only reason to be interested in macroeconomics is to want to\ncontribute to policy which will improve people’s lives at a systematic level and\naccomplish important societal goals. No goal is more important than responding\nto climate change today. My monetary policy report\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/new-report-monetary-policy-without-interest-rate-hikes/] \nfrom earlier this year is in large part about using direct credit regulation as\npart of a macroeconomic strategy for dealing with climate change. \n\n\nAs a result, I can’t “stay neutral” on these topics. I have developed my own\nview of Climate Change, and the very substantial body of empirical evidence and\nexpert opinion among scientists and energy specialists so that I can provide\nuseful and accurate macroeconomic analysis. This doesn’t mean I won’t continue\nto write about granular financial market issues (as the Monetary Policy report\nitself demonstrates). But just as I’ve commented on the coronavirus pandemic\nwith an eye to the actual public health situation, I will now do the same with\nclimate change. \n\n\nI will also say that ignoring issues of climate change would also make my\nanalysis of monetary policy and financial regulation less accurate over time. I\ncan attest from my experience attending the Journal of Financial Regulation\nconference [https://twitter.com/JFinReg/status/1555164505700720645] two weeks\nago that climate change is very much a contemporary part of the monetary policy\nconversation, and will not be going away any time soon.\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]With that out of the way,\nlet’s return to the issue at hand. The core idea of the Inflation Reduction Act\nis pairing a series of tax credits for renewable energy, battery storage and so\non with approvals for fossil fuel infrastructure, and mandatory auctioning of\noil and gas drilling leases on federal lands. Now at one level, this is merely\nwhat they needed to agree to to get Senator Manchin on board. Or more\naccurately, this is what Manchin proposed, and what Democratic party leadership\nagreed to more or less sign on the dotted line. \n\n\nAt another level though, I think this bill also represents some intellectual\nshifts on climate change in Washington DC. Over a decade ago, climate change\npolicy was defined by proposals to “price carbon” (under strong influence by\northodox economists), and more general restrictions on fossil fuel development.\nIt was seen as an area where, more or less, you either “do climate policy” by\n“giving in” to climate change advocates — or you don't. There were problems with\nthis perspective, as I discussed in some detail in my original piece about\nEmploy America. And it’s thankfully no longer the limit to these discussions. In\nresponse to the failures of the climate movement during the Obama years—and in\nthe upheaval of the Trump administration—different policy ideas surrounding\nclimate change emerged\n[https://www.volts.wtf/p/some-thoughts-on-the-inflation-reduction]. Tying\nclimate change to true full employment policies (particularly at the low end of\nthe labor market) and transformative spending projects, rather than carbon\npricing gained credence. The idea of a “Green New Deal” encapsulated many of\nthese emerging intellectual trends.\n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, in a bizarre and unintended way, shares this\nintellectual lineage even if it's a fraction of the proposed green spending. It\nfocuses on transformative spending tax credits rather than schemes to “put a\nprice on carbon”. However, it also goes beyond that. Rather than simply “not\npricing carbon” or directly restricting fossil fuel development, it ties these\nspending projects to supporting fossil fuel projects. In the context of looming\nbottlenecks and high energy prices, part of the “inflation reduction” plan today\nis clearly to boost fossil fuel production. The Biden Administration’s\nimplementation of Employ America’s proposal signals to me that these elements\nare not merely “concessions”. They are part of an intellectual trend that has\nextrapolated from the deemphasis of carbon pricing to a broader worldview. One\nwhere currently stable fossil fuel prices—without pursuing things that will\nreduce energy demand—is the most important priority.\n\n\nWhen challenged by climate activists, scientists and specialists who recognize\nthe obvious need to phase out fossil fuel production as quickly as possible,\nadvocates of this worldview give one of two answers.The first foregrounds the\npreviously mentioned issue that this was “the best that can be gotten”. This\nclaim, while hard to argue with, is missing some key points. For one thing, now\nthat the legislation is passed there is nothing stopping the Biden\nadministration from doing everything it can possibly do to discourage energy\nconsumption (besides selective arguments about electoral success)  Second,\nsettling for a “compromise” does not mean you have to gild the proverbial lily,\nand make it out as something better than it is.\n\nThe second response dismisses concerns about increased fossil fuel production.\nThis argument points to projections of significant emission reductions relative\nto the “no Inflation Reduction Act” status quo. Petroleum and Gas production is\nprojected to fall by 13% and 8% respectively by 2030 according to the REPEAT\nProject\n[https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Prelminary_Report_2022-08-12.pdf],\none of the major modelers of the energy and emission consequences of different\nU.S. legislation. As the researchers behind this project will tell you\nthemselves, there is considerable uncertainty built into their projections.\nThese are also relatively small projected cuts. The REPEAT project does a good\njob of pointing out that variations in U.S. oil and gas production will largely\nbe determined by variations in the rest of the world’s demand for U.S. energy.\n\n\n\n\nUnder their “high” Oil and Gas scenario, U.S. Oil and Gas production is not all\nthat different a decade from now. This is in large part because of a large run\nup in oil and gas exports. Their estimate of the additional emissions as a\nresult of this production does not count the emissions from using these fossil\nfuels. As such, it is at least partially an undercount of emissions (depending\non how you want to think about the demand for fossil fuels). It’s worth \npointing\nout that the U.S. had a longstanding ban on exporting crude oil\n[https://newrepublic.com/article/164307/bidens-energy-secretary-dodges-question-oil-gas-exports] \nfrom 1975 to 2015 that was lifted in December 2015 (just days after the Paris\nAgreement on Climate was signed…) \n\n\nReinstating that ban while the Ukraine crisis continues is likely not a good\nidea. However, we shouldn’t treat these export-based emissions as natural and\ninevitable over the long term when they are a result of a remarkably recent\npolicy change. It's hard not to look at these numbers and think that U.S. policy\nis aimed at continuing to be a fossil fuel exporting power house to the 2040s\nand beyond. The logic of using the U.S. Treasury to stabilize energy markets\nleads seamlessly to the U.S. becoming an even greater fossil fuel exporter (and\nit's already number two). Not burning the fossil fuels we produce is starting to\nbe rhetorically reframed as purely the problem of those who import them. Of\ncourse, market conditions can shift rapidly. Fossil fuel prices collapsed in\n2020.\n[https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/selected-fossil-fuel-prices-in-2019-2020]\nWe are only at the beginning of a decade of intense instability. Conditions\ncould still easily shift rapidly against U.S. fossil fuel exports. However, just\nas the 2014-2015 fossil fuel bust was not an intentional goal of policy, we\nshouldn’t credit any future fossil fuel busts to the policy suites that are now\neasing constraints on fossil fuel production.\n\n\nIt is well beyond the scope of this piece to provide a full assessment of the\nclimate implications of the Inflation Reduction Act. Others are\n[https://www.drilledpodcast.com/manchins-inflation-reduction-act-whats-good-and-bad-for-climate/] \n after all\n[https://www.volts.wtf/p/some-thoughts-on-the-inflation-reduction?utm_source=podcast-email&utm_medium=email#details] \n better suited\n[https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2022/08/11/modeling-ira-carbon-cuts-caveats-uncertainty-and-luggage-00050741] \nto that task. However, I do want to comment on one further element I found\ntroubling in looking at the REPEAT Project\n[https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Prelminary_Report_2022-08-12.pdf]’s\nforecasts. A significant percentage of their forecasted emission reductions come\nfrom “carbon capture and storage”. Professor Jenkins, who heads the project,\nconfirmed for me on twitter that 20% of the forecasted emission reductions comes\nfrom a rapid scaling up of still nascent CCS technologies. As professor Charles\nHarvey and his industrialist coauthor Kurt House pointed out just today in the\nNew York Times\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/opinion/climate-inflation-reduction-act.html]\n, more than 90% of the commercial CCS projects in the United States are\ncapturing carbon dioxide in order to inject it into the ground and “enhance oil\nrecovery”. This makes CCS tax credits to fossil fuel producers, especially Oil\nand Gas, another fossil fuel subsidy.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Jenkins is quick to point out that if carbon capture in electricity\ngeneration does not scale up, this does not mean that all those emissions gains\nare lost. That’s quite correct: instead, this may simply mean that wind and\nsolar power expands even more than in his forecasts. Obviously, the forecast is\nalso subject to considerable uncertainty — so the exact numbers should not be\ntaken so seriously. However, that does not stop news articles from bandying\nabout numbers from these forecasts, as if they are established matters of fact.\nBen Storrow in Politico Pro had an excellent article\n[https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2022/08/11/modeling-ira-carbon-cuts-caveats-uncertainty-and-luggage-00050741] \non the three main climate models assessing the Inflation Reduction Act, and the\nvery considerable uncertainty involved in these forecasts. It is also possible\nthat very pessimistic assumptions about carbon capture would make these\nforecasted emission reductions far less rosy. Without the models being rerun,\nit's hard to say anything definitive.\n\n\n\nFinally, an important element of these forecasts renews focus on state and local\npolicy, both in zoning and in fiscal policy. To grow at the projected pace,\nsignificant non-financial barriers need to be swept out of the way. From land\nuse laws to utility rules and everything in between, there are many reasons why\na basic financial incentive to pursue receiving a tax credit may not be enough.\nIn particular, these forecasts involve an unprecedented rate of growth in solar\nand wind investment. These models also assume that adequate transmission and\nstorage will be built to accommodate whatever renewable energy is generated.\nThis is a herculean assumption — as the modelers themselves will readily tell\nyou. \n\nMy point is not that this forecast should be discounted, but rather that local\nand state actors\n[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ira-climate-states_n_62f54317e4b045e6f6abb444] \n(both governmental and non-governmental) will need to make these forecasts true.\nA huge fight is already gearing up over energy policy now that the Inflation\nReduction Act is law.  Subnational fiscal policy may readily expand in\nanticipation of being “repaid” by utility customers, and these federal tax\ncredits. Using public investment to speed up these decarbonization investments\nwill become newly attractive, in a post-IRA world. Even if you aren’t\nparticularly interested in climate change as a topic, this big brewing fight at\nthe state and local level will potentially reshape the U.S. economy. The\naftermath of the IRA will significantly change the finances of large segments of\nthe private sector and public sector. You may not be interested in climate\npolicy, but climate policy is interested in you.\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]Printer Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-h0mMJoTBLh51EXn7V1HqNNsWYtiEh-4?usp=sharing]","html":"<div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>At the end of July, a few hours after I wrote about <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-insuring-the-oil-and-gas-industry-the-right-response-to-the-fallout-from-ukraine/\">Employ America’s Oil and Gas proposal</a>, the Biden administration implemented a modified form of their proposal. To briefly summarize, the Biden administration committed to further emptying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. At  the same time, they committed to buying oil over the next few years, at specified minimum prices. Depending on your point of view, the timing of my piece was either perfect or extremely bad. The very next day the world was caught off guard by a surprise deal between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and habitual enfant terrible Joe Manchin. <br></p><p>Schumer and Manchin’s fiscal deal, amusingly named the “Inflation Reduction Act”, is <strong>far smaller than the original Build Back Better proposal.</strong> It is also much smaller than the cut down proposals people tried to get Manchin to accede to. But it is still something, and better than nothing. It also has a number of climate provisions, but also Oil and Gas provisions. A colleague of mine described it as a “quarter of a loaf” — and I am still deciding whether I would even be that generous. Nonetheless, it is something at a time when it seemed like there might not be any further fiscal action at all.<br></p><p>Ever since both announcements came down I have been trying to formulate what I think about both issues. In particular, I have a strong sense that these are deeply related topics.  My issues with both Employ America’s proposal and the Inflation Reduction Act are deeply intertwined, but it has been difficult to articulate. At their core, both policy shifts indicate an emerging approach to climate change that emphasizes growing both the fossil fuel and renewable energy industries in the near term, and crucially <strong>only phasing out fossil fuel production when it is convenient. </strong>This is a policy which involves no disruptions which will need to be managed. In this view, emissions are purely “induced” by the demand for goods and services. They don’t involve particular production choices by fossil fuel businesses themselves.<br></p><p>Before diving into my problems with this perspective, I want to speak to one type of criticism I got from readers after my EA piece. I have many, many readers who are interested in my financial markets analysis, and maybe even some of my macroeconomic analysis but who think I should stay out of topics like climate change. <strong>That will not be happening.</strong> <br></p><p>Ultimately, the only reason to be interested in macroeconomics is to want to contribute to policy which will improve people’s lives at a systematic level and accomplish important societal goals.

The aftermath of the IRA will significantly change the finances of large segments of the private sector and public sector. <strong>You may not be interested in climate policy, but climate policy is interested in you.</strong></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-h0mMJoTBLh51EXn7V1HqNNsWYtiEh-4?usp=sharing&ref=crisesnotes.com\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Printer Friendly Version</a></div>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-inflation-reduction-act-employ-america-and-oil-gas-now-what/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"7e360e28-d4c2-4447-b751-9ee7b3aca225","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"62fb8e72693255003d2cae20","reading_time":9}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"July 26","id":"Ghost__Post__62dfc34d693255003d2bd838","title":"Is “Insuring” The Oil and Gas Industry the Right Response to the fallout from Ukraine?","slug":"is-insuring-the-oil-and-gas-industry-the-right-response-to-the-fallout-from-ukraine","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2022/07/craiyon_055807_a_bubble_around_an_oil_rig.png","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/85b5466c1631f1f4157d12c01959607d/14e2f/craiyon_055807_a_bubble_around_an_oil_rig.png","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/85b5466c1631f1f4157d12c01959607d/0ec34/craiyon_055807_a_bubble_around_an_oil_rig.png 352w,\n/migrantinsider/static/85b5466c1631f1f4157d12c01959607d/db7c3/craiyon_055807_a_bubble_around_an_oil_rig.png 704w,\n/migrantinsider/static/85b5466c1631f1f4157d12c01959607d/14e2f/craiyon_055807_a_bubble_around_an_oil_rig.png 1408w","sizes":"(min-width: 1408px) 1408px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/85b5466c1631f1f4157d12c01959607d/8c53c/craiyon_055807_a_bubble_around_an_oil_rig.webp 352w,\n/migrantinsider/static/85b5466c1631f1f4157d12c01959607d/d7f34/craiyon_055807_a_bubble_around_an_oil_rig.webp 704w,\n/migrantinsider/static/85b5466c1631f1f4157d12c01959607d/2f68b/craiyon_055807_a_bubble_around_an_oil_rig.webp 1408w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1408px) 1408px, 100vw"}]},"width":1408,"height":1063}}},"excerpt":"This is a free piece of Notes on the Crises.

One point I have\nemphasized is that there hasn’t been a generalized shortage of goods and\nservices across the board since the Coronavirus pandemic began. Instead, there\nhave been particular important inputs and consumer goods experiencing\nbottlenecks. These bottlenecks have had spillover effects on other parts of the\neconomy. Early in 2020 I described\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/how-to-pay-for-the-pandemic-war/] the initial phase\nof the pandemic as the tricky task of “safely mobilizing people to produce more\nsafety equipment and then mobilizing non-front line workers with spare safety\nequipment to meet other needs. The production of N-95 masks by means of N-95\nmasks, as it were.”\n\n\n\nIn 2021 the bottleneck in safety equipment abated but new bottlenecks emerged\nin\nsemi-conductors, wood products, meat and oil\n[https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/the-physical-capacity-shortage-view-of-inflation/] \n(among a few other products). These particular bottlenecks had outsized impacts\non the overall economy, and consumer price indices. Energy, meat and\nsemi-conductor related car prices have been overwhelmingly the source of higher\nmeasured “inflation”. That means these particular industries have been critical\nto the call for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.\n\n\nWhile a pandemic was not at the front of my mind in 2019, a scenario much like\nthis did occupy my mind in 2019. In fact, it was almost all I could talk about. \nAt a time of persistently low interest rates and low inflation, I was concerned\nabout how proposals to transform the economy (such as the Green New Deal) would\nrun aground on localized bottlenecks, rising measured inflation and rising\ninterest rates. In a Financial Times op ed\n[https://www.ft.com/content/539618f8-b88c-3125-8031-cf46ca197c64] published\nMarch 2019 by my colleagues Rohan Grey, Scott Fullwiler and myself wrote about\nthe various institutional changes that would need to be made to proactively\nrespond to inflation while engaging in large spending projects. We emphasized,\nin particular, that elevated price indices were neither necessary nor sufficient\nevidence of bottlenecks:\n\n\n\n> Regardless of which policy tool is used in a particular context, demand\nmanagement in general needs to lean much more heavily on the appearance of\nbottlenecks in specific industries instead of simply tracking changes in a\ngeneral price index. The immediate signs of bottlenecks are large and sustained\nrises in unfilled orders for specific goods and services. Preventing shortages\nis after all what demand management is first and foremost about and price\nindices are misleading policy targets when they include factors that are\ninsensitive to demand and would be counterproductive to manage with demand.\n\n\nIn other words, we were warning in advance that higher inflation wasn’t strong\nevidence of excess aggregate demand, and that bottlenecks which require policy\nresponses could emerge without any sign in CPI. This warning, to say the least,\nhas not been heeded. But it points the way towards what a better policy suite \ncould have been.\n\n\n\nThe particular bottlenecks which emerged in 2021 have been made worse over time\nby the reluctance of businesses in these sectors to speedily increase investment\nin response. To understand why, it would be useful to go back to the most basic\n— but too often forgotten — elements of John Maynard Keynes’s General Theory of\nEmployment, Interest and Money. In particular, his idea of “effective demand”. \n\n\nI could spend a lot of time talking about this idea — there are whole books that\nin fact do this! But instead I will be emphasizing one particular element. In my\nwriting in Notes on the Crises — and in other writings about macroeconomics —\nyou will see the term “demand”, the phrases “aggregate demand” and “excess\naggregate demand”, and other variations used regularly. These terms are useful,\nif in large part just to understand what orthodox economists and policymakers\nare saying. However, they don’t tell us the whole story. In the General Theory,\nKeynes focuses on defining and refining his idea of “Effective Demand”. The key\ndifference between aggregate demand and effective demand — and the most\nimportant element for our purposes — is that effective demand refers to the\nexpectations of “entrepreneurs”. Effective demand is not simply the actual sums\nof money being spent, or preparing to be spent, “out there”. In our world, we\ncan simply think of the expectations of firms rather than “entrepreneurs”. If\nthose in charge of firms are pessimistic about future sales, effective demand \nwill be low. That’s true regardless of the factors impacting aggregate demand.\n\n\nOf course, in the immediate future, it is hard to imagine this kind of mismatch\nsustaining itself. If a firm doesn’t produce because it expects its products to\nremain unsold, the sales and market share growth of its competitors will likely\nchange its tune. It does not, after all, take all that much to restart\nproduction that has been recently mothballed (abstracting from sudden\nbottlenecks of key inputs).\n\n\nKeynes understood this point well, which is why he divided expectations into two\ntypes. “Short term” expectations referred to the expectation that a firm can\nsell what it can produce with the plant and equipment it already controls. “Long\nterm” expectations are \"concerned with what the entrepreneur [firm] can hope to\nearn in the shape of future returns if he purchases (or, perhaps, manufactures)\n'finished' output as an addition to his capital equipment\". In other words, long\nterm expectations relate to whether the sales will be there to make building \nmore capacity, or even an entire new factory, worth it. \n\n\nHere lies the issue. Keynes highlights that: \"The actually realised results of\nthe production and sale of output will only be relevant to employment in so far\nas they cause a modification of subsequent expectation\". If sales growth in 2021\nor 2022 doesn’t lead to expectations of higher sales in 2027 and 2028,\nbusinesses have no reason to invest in plant and equipment with multi-year,\nperhaps even multi-decade, lifespans. \n\n\nNow it is likely that years upon years of annual sales growth could eventually\nalign “short term” and “long term” expectations. However, that would take quite\na long time. This possibility is also being currently closed by the Federal\nReserve. Chairman Powell is doing his best to validate business expectations\nthat effective demand has not increased by lowering aggregate demand today. In a\nsense, interest rate policy is closing the gap by perversely lowering short term\nexpectations until they are in line with long term expectations. Even more\nperversely, their very unwillingness to invest in new capacity has contributed\nto the elevated CPI readings, which have led to elite pressure on the Federal\nReserve to lower inflation through choking demand.\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]Which brings me to my\ncolleagues at Employ America [https://twitter.com/employamerica]. They \nrecognized this issue\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-24/the-economy-is-booming-why-don-t-firms-believe-it] \nearly on in 2021 and have been aiming their output at making policy\nrecommendations to ameliorate them. Two weeks ago I covered their\nrecommendations\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/dont-let-dick-cheney-ruin-price-regulation-too/] \nfor bringing down price growth in sectors that are not experiencing bottlenecks.\nThe other half of their output has been devoted to particular bottlenecked\nsectors and what can be done about them. In May they called their analysis the \n“The Physical Capacity Shortage View of Inflation”\n[https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/the-physical-capacity-shortage-view-of-inflation/]\n. If we can’t quickly break through pessimistic expectations that are lowering\n“long term effective demand” by boosting “short term effective demand”, we need\nto either directly invest in additional capacity or insure firms against\nnegative surprises in the future.\n\n\nOn this general point, I agree with Employ America. And if their proposals only\napplied to relatively minor (though economically important) sectors like the\nsemi-conductor manufacturing industry, I would not voice any objection. However,\nthey are not just making proposals in these sectors. They are also proposing\ninsuring the oil and gas industry against costly surprises, in order to sustain\nand boost oil and gas investment. To summarize briefly, their proposal\n[https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/spr-esf-dpa/] is to have the\nTreasury use a facility called the “Exchange Stabilization Fund'' to sell oil\nproducers a financial contract that would protect them from declines in oil\nprices. These types of contracts- called “put options''- give their holders the\noption- but not the obligation- to sell oil at a previously agreed upon price to\nthe U.S. government. The government could then, in turn, take physical delivery\nof oil and add it to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\n\nThis is a very well thought out and creative proposal. I have no doubt that it\nis one way to stabilize oil markets. However, as someone who focuses on climate\nchange as a topic for economic policy, I must object. There are particular\nglaring factors which make these kinds of schemes inadvisable in the Oil and Gas\nindustry, even if there is a good argument for them elsewhere.\n\n\nTo state the obvious, fossil fuels are the core source of carbon emissions. They\nare, along with other greenhouse gases, preventing heat from escaping into space\nand gradually warming planet Earth. Burning as little remaining fossil fuels as\npossible while we pursue electrifying our economy and, at the same time,\ndecarbonizing electricity production is the main mission humanity has in the\n21st century. In turn, the oil and gas industry is the main political opponent\nwhich advocates of combating climate change have to defeat (though by no means\nthe only one). Making sure that the oil and gas industry doesn’t bear the\ndownside uncertainties inherent in oil and gas investment strengthens this\nindustry — and makes it more difficult to defeat. \n\n\nThis political basis alone would be enough to object to such proposals. Yet, the\nissue at hand is worse than this. The very problem these proposals aim to solve\nshows us why it's a bad idea in this case. While we can’t get rid of fossil fuel\ninfrastructure overnight (to say the least!) we have to avoid incentivizing a\nbig jump in Oil and Gas infrastructure and capacity. Recall that the argument\nfor these kinds of proposals is that the plant and equipment involved last for\nlong periods of time, and thus short term increases in sales can’t overcome long\nterm pessimistic expectations. This means any oil and gas investment these\nschemes successfully induce will be around for at least a decade. And in some\ncases, 20 years or more. The timeline under which we need to stop removing oil\nfrom the ground and burning it is far more strenuous than that for our existing \noil and gas infrastructure.\n\n\nOf course, this is an industry that is currently experiencing bottlenecks. Those\nare causing disruptions and those disruptions will likely get worse during the\nwinter. Simply not increasing oil and gas investment will not solve these\nproblems. Even worse, high gas prices are a major political stumbling block to\nclimate action. Decarbonization works best politically when it emerges before\ndisruptions to the Oil and Gas industry and envelopes the economy before drivers\nsee any pain at the pump. (Ideally, without any pain at the pump at all). A\nfossil fuel bottlenecked and dirty economy is an improbable candidate for\naggressive climate action. This is something I agree with Employ America\nresearchers about, and is thus a criticism of mainstream climate policy\nadvocates I share. Carbon pricing and institutional investor disinvestment have\ngotten far too much attention relative to the transformation the economy — and\nour energy grid- needs  and the aggressive fiscal policies needed to make that\nhappen. The action has been more on the demand side than has been commonly\nacknowledged (in fact far more so).\n\n\nHowever, none of that means we need more fossil fuel infrastructure. There are\nmany ways of tackling energy consumption today (and reducing emissions) while\ncooling the global oil and gas market. Paul Williams, Yakov Feygin, Chirag Lala\nand Mitch Green put out a report last month entitled “Cooling oil consumption\nto\nease price pressures”\n[https://www.publicenterprise.org/reports/cooling-oil-consumption-to-ease-price-pressures]\n. They get to the heart of the matter with five broad ways to get oil\nconsumption down:\n\n 1. Fare holiday to get people on buses, trains and micro-mobility as quickly as\n    possible\n 2. Compress timelines for transit infrastructure investments to grow ridership\n    base\n 3. Incentives for firms to allow and encourage employees to work from home\n 4. Encourage carpooling with incentives and a bully pulpit campaign\n 5. Consider a national speed limit reduction\n\nReaders can agree or disagree with one or more of these proposals, or declare\nthat they would not be enough. However, the point is, in the case of energy, we\nhave a lot of levers that we can move before we try to increase oil and gas\ninvestment. Get other smart people in a room, and at least a dozen more good\nideas will emerge. The International Energy Agency has produced its own ten\npoint plan [https://www.iea.org/reports/a-10-point-plan-to-cut-oil-use] to\nreduce oil use which overlaps with the Center for Public Enterprise’s proposals.\nTo be clear: I know the folks at Employ America do not oppose these measures.\nHowever, I do not think proposing subsidies — however uniquely structured or\nwell designed those subsidies are — for the oil and gas industry is appropriate.\nAt least not as long as there are so many other options to pursue. \n\n\nEmploy America are respected for doing serious analysis because they do serious\nanalysis. I suspect (though do not personally know) that there are officials in\nthe Biden administration who listen to them. I think this for the simple reason\nthat they are one of the few organizations consistently putting out realistic,\nsectorally informed and detailed proposals responding to current economic\nproblems. When important organizations like Employ America put these kinds of\nproposals on the table, they legitimate them. An administration looking for easy\nand quick fixes will gravitate to the easiest and quickest fix offered by people\nwho know what they are talking about. That is dangerous when it comes to oil and\ngas. As a result, I strenuously disagree with this proposal being accepted, and\ncall for others to reject it as designed. Economic policy advocates, officials\nand staffers should start from the position that fossil fuel infrastructure\nshould not be supported or subsidized without countervailing regulation, public\nownership or stipulations . I hope my friends at Employ America junk it as well.\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]Printer Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IKW3OFcZmrrAzEK32A1GyURlWgFL5c-b/view?usp=sharing]","html":"<p><em>This is a free piece of Notes on the Crises.

Yet, the issue at hand is worse than this. The very problem these proposals aim to solve shows us why it's a bad idea in this case. While we can’t get rid of fossil fuel infrastructure overnight (to say the least!)<strong> we have to avoid incentivizing a big jump in Oil and Gas infrastructure and capacity. </strong>Recall that the argument for these kinds of proposals is that the plant and equipment involved last for long periods of time, and thus short term increases in sales can’t overcome long term pessimistic expectations. This means any oil and gas investment these schemes successfully induce will be around for at least a decade. And in some cases, 20 years or more. The timeline under which we need to stop removing oil from the ground and burning it is far more strenuous than that for our <strong>existing</strong> oil and gas infrastructure.<br></p><p>Of course, this is an industry that is currently experiencing bottlenecks. Those are causing disruptions and those disruptions will likely get worse during the winter. Simply not increasing oil and gas investment will not solve these problems. Even worse, high gas prices are a major political stumbling block to climate action. Decarbonization works best politically when it emerges <strong>before disruptions to the Oil and Gas industry</strong> and envelopes the economy before drivers see any pain at the pump. (Ideally, without any pain at the pump at all). A fossil fuel bottlenecked and dirty economy is an improbable candidate for aggressive climate action. This is something I agree with Employ America researchers about, and is thus a criticism of mainstream climate policy advocates I share. Carbon pricing and <strong>institutional investor disinvestment have gotten far too much attention </strong>relative to the transformation the economy — and our energy grid- needs  and the aggressive fiscal policies needed to make that happen. The action has been more on the demand side than has been commonly acknowledged (in fact far more so).<br></p><p>However, none of that means we need more fossil fuel infrastructure. There are many ways of tackling energy consumption today (and reducing emissions) while cooling the global oil and gas market. Paul Williams, Yakov Feygin, Chirag Lala and Mitch Green put out a report last month entitled <a href=\"https://www.publicenterprise.org/reports/cooling-oil-consumption-to-ease-price-pressures?ref=crisesnotes.com\">“Cooling oil consumption to ease price pressures”</a>. They get to the heart of the matter with five broad ways to get oil consumption down:</p><ol><li>Fare holiday to get people on buses, trains and micro-mobility as quickly as possible</li><li>Compress timelines for transit infrastructure investments to grow ridership base</li><li>Incentives for firms to allow and encourage employees to work from home</li><li>Encourage carpooling with incentives and a bully pulpit campaign</li><li>Consider a national speed limit reduction</li></ol><p>Readers can agree or disagree with one or more of these proposals, or declare that they would not be enough. However, the point is, in the case of energy, <strong>we have a lot of levers that we can move before we try to increase oil and gas investment. </strong>Get other smart people in a room, and at least a dozen more good ideas will emerge. The International Energy Agency has produced <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/a-10-point-plan-to-cut-oil-use?ref=crisesnotes.com\">its own ten point plan</a> to reduce oil use which overlaps with the Center for Public Enterprise’s proposals. To be clear: I know the folks at Employ America do not oppose these measures. However, I do not think proposing subsidies — however uniquely structured or well designed those subsidies are — for the oil and gas industry is appropriate. At least not as long as there are so many other options to pursue. <br></p><p>Employ America are respected for doing serious analysis because <strong>they do</strong> serious analysis. I suspect (though do not personally know) that there are officials in the Biden administration who listen to them. I think this for the simple reason that they are one of the few organizations consistently putting out realistic, sectorally informed and detailed proposals responding to current economic problems. When important organizations like Employ America put these kinds of proposals on the table, they legitimate them. An administration looking for easy and quick fixes will gravitate to the easiest and quickest fix offered by people who know what they are talking about. <strong>That is dangerous when it comes to oil and gas. </strong>As a result, I strenuously disagree with this proposal being accepted, and call for others to reject it as designed. Economic policy advocates, officials and staffers should start from the position that fossil fuel infrastructure should not be supported or subsidized without countervailing regulation, public ownership or stipulations . I hope my friends at Employ America junk it as well.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn

There I briefly touched on some\nreceived narratives about “price gouging” that have circulated among the center\nleft. While I am skeptical that much of the elevated growth in the Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI) or the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index (PCE) so\nfar can be explained by discrete corporate pricing decisions, orthodox economist\nresponses to these discussions have been far worse. They have tried to rule out\nthe possibility that corporations can ever raise prices to elevate target profit\nmargins (merely by assumption). They have also taken aim at any form of direct\nprice regulation, by shaking around textbook mythologies about past experiences\nwith “price controls” (claims made without much historical context.)\n\n\nThere have been too many commentaries, and too much nonsense, to deal with every\nargument here. However, I will take aim at a few primary issues that I think\nhave been the core of these silly exchanges. \n\n\nAt the most fundamental level, this conversation starts from assuming its own\nconclusion. As discussed last week: mainstream economists believe that elevated\ninflation is a result of “excess” aggregate demand. If you believe this, direct\nprice regulation cannot “stop” (or permanently reduce) inflation by assumption.\nAll it can do is “repress” inflation: make shortages worse, and lead to higher\ninflation when price regulations are lifted. The money that people would have\nspent on higher prices for those goods will simply be directed to other, less\nprice regulated goods.\n\n\nThe obvious issue is that we don’t all agree with orthodox economists about what\nis leading to higher headline inflation today. If the price increases are\nconcentrated in certain sectors—which they are—and the bottlenecks are\nconcentrated on specific goods—which they are—then price regulation in sectors\nthat aren’t experiencing bottlenecks can lower headline inflation, without\nattendant problems. Price regulation can even be effective where the bottlenecks\nare heavily concentrated in very specific areas.\n[https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2021/dec/29/inflation-price-controls-time-we-use-it]\n\n\nEven more fundamentally, if we believe that firm pricing power is a sustained\nissue of public concern (and not simply something that only matters in\nextraordinary situations) then we don’t have to believe that price regulation is\nof limited, time specific, interest. This is a very controversial point in some\ncircles—but I think returning to a concrete assessment of price indices can make\nit more palatable for even the most hard charging critics of price regulation.\nTelecoms, utilities, medical prices, education, insurance and rental housing are\nall “unique” areas of the economy, where even many centrists agree that very\nsignificant pricing power exists, and should be constrained in some way. For\nsome of these sectors, even direct price regulation is much less controversial\nthan it is elsewhere. Rent regulation is of course very controversial outside\nthe left—but at this point, even right wingers argue that legal changes need to\nbe made to constrain rent increases. They just believe those legal changes\nshould only be zoning changes.\n\n\nWhen you add up these categories, they make up between 40% and 47% of price\nindices, depending on the weighting used or whether you use the Consumer Price\nIndex or the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index. Granted the majority\nof that number is made of housing in CPI (but not PCE). Yet, as I will argue,\nthe case that direct price regulation wouldn’t lower rental inflation (even if\nyou think it is a bad policy) is not very compelling. The central argument\nagainst direct rent regulation at the local level is based on the idea that it\nwould eliminate the private incentive to build more housing. This argument is \nbased on “first generation” rent regulations. These set absolute caps and,\nespecially under wartime conditions, made it notionally possible that landlords\ncould have costs outrun rents. But how relevant is this approach to today’s\npolicy discussions? No area of the United States has had this kind of rent \nregulation in decades\n[https://jwmason.org/slackwire/considerations-on-rent-control/] (with the\nexception of some apartments, which are grandfathered in literally from the\nworld war two era, in a few jurisdictions).\n\n\n\n\nThis post isn’t going to discuss the topic of rent regulation in full detail.\nHowever, regardless of what you think about the rent regulation debate at the\nlocal level, it is extremely unlikely that whatever rent regulation could be\napplied to rent renewals at the federal level would make it unprofitable to\nconstruct more housing, to serve areas which have seen significant population\nnet inflows (such as the south). Further, in the extreme case that this was a\nserious concern, the federal government could devote far more funding to simply\nconstructing new housing directly. Even if you think both rent regulations and\npublic housing construction (or even just public financing of housing\nconstruction) are bad ideas, I think it would be very difficult to make the case\nthat rental inflation would be just as high, if that program was implemented.\n\n\nNow if you accept the orthodox story, all of this is basically irrelevant. Sure,\ndirect price regulation may reduce the upward contribution of these categories\nto price indices, but all of that will be redirected elsewhere. However, if you\ndon’t accept this story, then strengthening price regulation over simply these\ncategories—where even conservatives argue there are market structure issues\nenabling market power driven price increases—can reduce headline inflation. My\ncolleagues at Employ America implicitly made this case in their\nstraightforwardly titled late 2021 article: “Offsetting Persistent Inflationary\nPressures With Disinflationary Healthcare Policy”\n[https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/inflation-and-healthcare/].\n\n\nIn the piece, they argued: \n\n\n> Unlike other major components of core PCE, federal policy and rule-making can\nhave substantial and direct effects for healthcare. Keeping inflation readings\nin check over the coming years would represent a major opportunity to\ndemonstrate that the ambitious fiscal response to the pandemic need not lead to\nhigh inflation. Targeted disinflationary healthcare policy at this juncture\ncould dramatically shift the policymaking and macroeconomic paradigms for a\ngeneration.\n\nIf Employ America bought the orthodox story, they would have to say that their\npolicy suggestions to reduce medical price inflation would simply cause\ninflation in other components of PCE. However they, like me, think the case for\naggregate demand led price increases are very weak and, like me, think it makes\nfor great politics and good economics to use targeted price regulation to lower\nheadline inflation. The presidential tools are the most straightforward in\nhealthcare but, as the most recent CPI print shows, rent is an area where they\ncould have the greatest impact—if they found the tools. Food and energy are the\nbiggest contributors to headline inflation by far, but they are most difficult\nto tackle with federal policy, let alone executive authority.\n\n\nWhich brings us back to “price controls”. The problem with price controls is not\nthat direct price regulation is a bad idea—it's that they have historically been\ndesigned with the idea in mind that “the” problem is excess demand. As should be\nclear from above, the “excess demand” argument implies that every single price\nin the economy needs to be “controlled”. Otherwise, “uncontrolled” prices will\nsimply experience larger price jumps. Even worse, price regulations needed to be\ntemporary in this framing. For one thing, you “have to” eventually return to\n“market organization”. For another, the point of the controls was to “slow the\nmomentum” of prices. Once “momentum” successfully slows, price stability should\ncontinue on its own. \n\nTo summarize, the relentless logic of the orthodox position leads to the idea\nthat if price controls are to work, they must be sophisticated enough to\nregulate every price in the economy. They also need to be a surprise—so markets\ndon’t “get ahead of them” with big price jumps. Finally, they must be temporary.\nLooked at this way, it's a miracle there are any successful experiences with\nprice controls. I also can’t emphasize enough that all of this sidesteps the\nissue of market power. If you think at least a part of headline inflation comes\nfrom businesses using pricing power to raise profit margins, then the frustrated\nprice increases in those sectors during the “control” period will simply appear\nall at once when prices are decontrolled. This is true even if you happen to be\nsomeone who thinks only peculiar businesses such as telecoms, utilities,\nhospitals and universities have that kind of market power. This “jump” of prices\nafter decontrol is precisely what was observed in the Nixon experience.\n\n\nThis is also not a retrospective criticism. Gardiner Means, the New Deal\neconomist who coined the term “administered prices” made this point in real\ntime, in both newspapers and articles. His criticisms are especially\nnotable—because he was no enemy of price regulation. In 1975 he referred to this\nprice control experience as “Nixon’s bumbling policies”\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKkrAzbHi9r7KtB6FjHiK9OzDuBOjIwT/view?usp=sharing]\n. Having read what Dick Cheney (yes that Dick Cheney!) had to say about his\nexperience running Nixon’s price controls it's very difficult not to agree.\nCheney’s boss was none other than Donald Rumsfeld. I can’t resist quoting Dick\nCheney at length:\n\n> \nThe Democratic majority in Congress was urging the president to use powers they\nhad given him when they passed the Economic Stabilization Act, legislation that\neffectively authorized him to commandeer the economy by imposing controls on\nwages, prices, salaries, and rents. The Democrats voted these extraordinary\npowers confident that no Republican president, much less a solid free market one\nnamed Richard Nixon, would ever use them, and in the meantime, they could\ncriticize him for not taking action. But Nixon took them up on their offer, and\non Sunday night, August 15, 1971, he announced a freeze for ninety days on all\nwages and prices. The Cost of Living Council was created to monitor the freeze\nand to achieve an orderly return to the free market when the ninety-day period\nwas over\n\n> The freeze was simple enough. Nobody was to raise wages or prices. But the\nfollow-on, which became known as Phase Two, would have to have rules covering\nall sorts of things, from permitted increases in union contracts to the price of\ndill pickles, for the period until market forces ruled again. The deadline for\nmoving from the freeze to Phase Two came fast, and the two entities that were\nsupposed to write the regulations, the Pay Board and the Price Commission,\nwrangled and dithered. When it looked as though they were going to miss a\ncrucial deadline for getting regulations published in the Federal Register,\nRumsfeld decided to take things in hand. He assembled Jack Grayson, the chairman\nof the Price Commission, and about a dozen of our CLC staff and said that we\nwouldn't be leaving until we had the regulations ready for the printer. We set\nup in Rumsfeld's outer office, and as others paced and dictated, I sat at one of\nthe secretary's desks and typed everything on an IBM Selectric typewriter. By\nnine the next morning, when the secretaries arrived and emptied the ashtrays and\nreplenished the coffee, we had written the regulations that would now be\ngoverning a major share of the U.S. economy. The degree of detail we achieved\nduring our overnighter was truly impressive. We drew distinctions between apples\nand applesauce; popped and unpopped corn; raw cabbage and packaged slaw; fresh\noranges and glazed citrus peel; garden plants, cut flowers, and floral wreaths.\nWe regulated seafood products \"including those which have been shelled, shucked,\niced, skinned, scaled, eviscerated, or decapitated.\" We covered products\ncustom-made to individual order, including leather goods, fur apparel, jewelry,\nand wigs and toupees.\n\n> Regulating energy prices was one of the most complex and complicated tasks the\nCLC had to address. At one point, when we were up against a deadline to set\nprices for the coming week on oil, we discovered that there was no one available\nwith expertise in that area. Then someone mentioned that Chachi Owens was from\nTexas and that Texas had a lot of oil, so we called Chachi and asked him to stop\nby. At that time he was working for the public affairs office. If the CLC was\ngoing to permit the price of bread to rise by two cents the following week, it\nwas Chachi Owens who would bring you that news. \n\n> Aside from his resonant voice, his claim to fame was that he had played fullback\nfor Darrell Royal at the University of Texas. He turned out to be a very bright\nyoung man. Perhaps it was his Texas confidence, or perhaps it was the result of\nthe coaching he'd received, but he had no hesitation about sitting down and\nwriting the oil regs we needed. [In My Time, pages 59-61]\n\n\nTo me, the lesson of the Nixon “price control” experience is that you don’t put\nRichard Nixon, Donald Rumsefeld and Dick Cheney in charge of the economy. Nixon,\na man who actually worked during World War Two in the Office of Price\nAdministration, did not like his experience, and hated his coworkers. Nixon\neven\nlater claimed later [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2953088] that it was this\nexperience which led to his “lifelong” hatred of Bureaucrats, and “big\ngovernment”. Like most of Nixon’s political moves, his dalliance with price\ncontrols was purely cynical, and carefully calculated. Very few policies can\nsurvive the lack of belief and lack of expertise of both the highest political\nofficial involved, and the government employees ordered to organize them. Add in\nthe surprise, temporary nature and complexity of the task of comprehensive price\ncontrols demanded by the orthodox framework, and you have a recipe for disaster.\n\n\n\nHowever, direct price regulation of selected sectors that are important in price\nindices are far easier to accomplish with the mechanisms that already exist.\nThey do not require price fixing for every single item, or attempts to use the\ntools best applied to administered price setters on markets(such as meat or oil)\nwhich are not organized by administered prices. Nor do they have to be temporary\nsince they are aimed at managing permanent issues of market structure and market\npower — rather than temporary issues of excess demand. Even extremely limited\nprice regulation can lower headline inflation, and relieve some pressure on the\nFederal Reserve to raise interest rates.\n\n\nCareful readers may have noticed that I focused on the sectors where the case\nfor market power-driven price increases are the most obvious, and least\ncontroversial. I happen to think that there is a case for direct price\nregulation in other sectors where administered prices predominate.

There I briefly touched on some received narratives about “price gouging” that have circulated among the center left. While I am skeptical that much of the elevated growth in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index (PCE) so far can be explained by discrete corporate pricing decisions, <strong>orthodox economist responses to these discussions have been far worse.</strong> They have tried to rule out the possibility that corporations can ever raise prices to elevate target profit margins (merely by assumption). They have also <strong>taken aim at any form of direct price regulation,</strong> by shaking around textbook mythologies about past experiences with “price controls” (claims made without much historical context.)<br></p><p>There have been too many commentaries, and too much nonsense, to deal with every argument here. However, I will <strong>take aim at a few primary issues</strong> that I think have been the core of these silly exchanges. <br></p><p>At the most fundamental level, this conversation starts from assuming its own conclusion. As discussed last week: <strong>mainstream economists believe that elevated inflation is a result of “excess” aggregate demand.</strong> If you believe this, direct price regulation cannot “stop” (or permanently reduce) inflation by assumption. All it can do is “repress” inflation: make shortages worse, and lead to higher inflation when price regulations are lifted. The money that people would have spent on higher prices for those goods will simply be directed to other, less price regulated goods.</p><p><br>The obvious issue is that <strong>we don’t all agree with orthodox economists about what is leading to higher headline inflation today.</strong> If the price increases are concentrated in certain sectors—which they are—and the bottlenecks are concentrated on specific goods—which they are—then price regulation in sectors that aren’t experiencing bottlenecks can lower headline inflation, <strong>without attendant problems.</strong> Price regulation can even be effective where the bottlenecks are heavily concentrated in very <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2021/dec/29/inflation-price-controls-time-we-use-it?ref=crisesnotes.com\">specific areas.</a><br></p><p>Even more fundamentally, if we believe that firm pricing power is a sustained issue of public concern (and not simply something that only matters in extraordinary situations) then we don’t have to believe that price regulation is of limited, time specific, interest. This is a <strong>very controversial point in some circles</strong>—but I think returning to a concrete assessment of price indices can make it more palatable for even the most hard charging critics of price regulation. Telecoms, utilities, medical prices, education, insurance and rental housing are all “unique” areas of the economy, where even many centrists agree that very significant pricing power exists, and should be constrained in some way. For some of these sectors,<strong> even direct price regulation is much less controversial than it is elsewhere</strong>. Rent regulation is of course very controversial outside the left—but at this point, even right wingers argue that legal changes need to be made to constrain rent increases. They just believe those legal changes should only be zoning changes.<br></p><p>When you add up these categories, they make up between 40% and 47% of price indices, depending on the weighting used or whether you use the Consumer Price Index or the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index. Granted the majority of that number is made of housing in CPI (but not PCE). Yet, as I will argue, the case that direct price regulation wouldn’t lower rental inflation (even if you think it is a bad policy) is not very compelling. The central argument against direct rent regulation at the local level is based on the idea that it would eliminate the private incentive to build more housing. This argument is <strong>based on “first generation” rent regulations.</strong> These set absolute caps and, especially under wartime conditions, made it notionally possible that landlords could have costs outrun rents. But how relevant is this approach to today’s policy discussions? No area of the United States has had this kind of rent <a href=\"https://jwmason.org/slackwire/considerations-on-rent-control/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">regulation in decades</a> (with the exception of some apartments, which are grandfathered in literally from the world war two era, in a few jurisdictions).<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5erYcJpbpsZQnqQ5tXsKLCAGW7J4gP1tO3c-S_UtfLkryospdLlVZoB9d1f6q5yUYLFKuHaVUyBMbNnEDzX_z8kB_iq6tYp5I7wWj2k6sV8HZFKe-iFL-Oa0RoqretcLIm4VpYjWF0SCtx_qCbOQSoE\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><br><br>This post isn’t going to discuss the topic of rent regulation in full detail. However, regardless of what you think about the rent regulation debate at the local level, it is <strong>extremely unlikely that whatever rent regulation could be applied to rent renewals at the federal level would make it unprofitable to construct more housing, </strong>to serve areas which have seen significant population net inflows (such as the south). Further, in the extreme case that this was a serious concern, <strong>the federal government could devote far more funding to simply constructing new housing directly.</strong> Even if you think both rent regulations and public housing construction (or even just public financing of housing construction) are bad ideas, I think it would be very difficult to make the case that rental inflation would be just as high, if that program was implemented.<br></p><p>Now if you accept the orthodox story, <strong>all of this is basically irrelevant.</strong> Sure, direct price regulation may reduce the upward contribution of these categories to price indices, but all of that will be redirected elsewhere. However, if <strong>you don’t accept this story,</strong> then strengthening price regulation over simply these categories—where even conservatives argue there are market structure issues enabling market power driven price increases—can reduce headline inflation. My colleagues at Employ America implicitly made this case in their straightforwardly titled late 2021 article: <a href=\"https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/inflation-and-healthcare/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">“Offsetting Persistent Inflationary Pressures With Disinflationary Healthcare Policy”</a>.<br></p><p>In the piece, they argued: <br></p><blockquote>Unlike other major components of core PCE, federal policy and rule-making can have substantial and direct effects for healthcare. Keeping inflation readings in check over the coming years would represent a major opportunity to demonstrate that the ambitious fiscal response to the pandemic need not lead to high inflation. Targeted disinflationary healthcare policy at this juncture could dramatically shift the policymaking and macroeconomic paradigms for a generation.<br></blockquote><p>If Employ America bought the orthodox story, they would have to say that their policy suggestions to reduce medical price inflation would simply cause inflation in other components of PCE. However they, like me, think the case for aggregate demand led price increases are very weak and, like me, think it makes for great politics and <em>good economics</em> to use targeted price regulation to lower headline inflation. The presidential tools are the most straightforward in healthcare but, as the most recent CPI print shows,<strong> rent is an area where they could have the greatest impact</strong>—if they found the tools. Food and energy are the biggest contributors to headline inflation by far, but they are most difficult to tackle with federal policy, let alone executive authority.</p><p><br>Which brings us back to “price controls”. The problem with price controls is not that direct price regulation is a bad idea—it's that they have <strong>historically been designed with the idea in mind that “the” problem is excess demand. </strong>As should be clear from above, the “excess demand” argument implies that every single price in the economy needs to be “controlled”. Otherwise, “uncontrolled” prices will simply experience larger price jumps. Even worse, price regulations needed to be temporary in this framing. For one thing, you “have to” eventually return to “market organization”. For another, the point of the controls was to “slow the momentum” of prices. Once “momentum” successfully slows, price stability should continue on its own. <br><br>To summarize, the relentless logic of the orthodox position leads to the idea that if price controls are to work, they must be sophisticated enough to regulate every price in the economy. They also need to be a surprise—so markets don’t “get ahead of them” with big price jumps. Finally, they must be temporary. Looked at this way, it's a miracle there are any successful experiences with price controls. I also can’t emphasize enough that all of this sidesteps the issue of market power. If you think at least a part of headline inflation comes from businesses using pricing power to raise profit margins, then the <strong>frustrated price increases in those sectors during the “control” period will simply appear all at once when prices are decontrolled.</strong> This is true even if you happen to be someone who thinks only peculiar businesses such as telecoms, utilities, hospitals and universities have that kind of market power. This<strong> “jump” of prices after decontrol </strong>is precisely what was observed in the Nixon experience.<br></p><p>This is also not a retrospective criticism. Gardiner Means, the New Deal economist who coined the term “administered prices” made this point in real time, in both newspapers and articles. His criticisms are especially notable—because he was no enemy of price regulation. In 1975 he referred to this price control experience as <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKkrAzbHi9r7KtB6FjHiK9OzDuBOjIwT/view?usp=sharing&ref=crisesnotes.com\">“Nixon’s bumbling policies”</a>. Having read what Dick Cheney (yes <strong>that </strong>Dick Cheney!) had to say about his experience running Nixon’s price controls it's very difficult not to agree. Cheney’s boss was <strong>none other than Donald Rumsfeld.</strong>  I can’t resist quoting Dick Cheney at length:</p><blockquote><br>The Democratic majority in Congress was urging the president to use powers they had given him when they passed the Economic Stabilization Act, legislation that effectively authorized him to commandeer the economy by imposing controls on wages, prices, salaries, and rents. The Democrats voted these extraordinary powers confident that no Republican president, much less a solid free market one named Richard Nixon, would ever use them, and in the meantime, they could criticize him for not taking action. But Nixon took them up on their offer, and on Sunday night, August 15, 1971, he announced a freeze for ninety days on all wages and prices. The Cost of Living Council was created to monitor the freeze and to achieve an orderly return to the free market when the ninety-day period was over<br></blockquote><blockquote>The freeze was simple enough. Nobody was to raise wages or prices. But the follow-on, which became known as Phase Two, would have to have rules covering all sorts of things, from permitted increases in union contracts to the price of dill pickles, for the period until market forces ruled again. The deadline for moving from the freeze to Phase Two came fast, and the two entities that were supposed to write the regulations, the Pay Board and the Price Commission, wrangled and dithered. When it looked as though they were going to miss a crucial deadline for getting regulations published in the Federal Register, Rumsfeld decided to take things in hand. He assembled Jack Grayson, the chairman of the Price Commission, and about a dozen of our CLC staff and said that we wouldn't be leaving until we had the regulations ready for the printer. We set up in Rumsfeld's outer office, and as others paced and dictated, I sat at one of the secretary's desks and typed everything on an IBM Selectric typewriter. By nine the next morning, when the secretaries arrived and emptied the ashtrays and replenished the coffee, we had written the regulations that would now be governing a major share of the U.S. economy. The degree of detail we achieved during our overnighter was truly impressive. We drew distinctions between apples and applesauce; popped and unpopped corn; raw cabbage and packaged slaw; fresh oranges and glazed citrus peel; garden plants, cut flowers, and floral wreaths. We regulated seafood products \"including those which have been shelled, shucked, iced, skinned, scaled, eviscerated, or decapitated.\" We covered products custom-made to individual order, including leather goods, fur apparel, jewelry, and wigs and toupees.<br></blockquote><blockquote>Regulating energy prices was one of the most complex and complicated tasks the CLC had to address. At one point, when we were up against a deadline to set prices for the coming week on oil, we discovered that there was no one available with expertise in that area. Then someone mentioned that Chachi Owens was from Texas and that Texas had a lot of oil, so we called Chachi and asked him to stop by. At that time he was working for the public affairs office. If the CLC was going to permit the price of bread to rise by two cents the following week, it was Chachi Owens who would bring you that news. <br></blockquote><blockquote>Aside from his resonant voice, his claim to fame was that he had played fullback for Darrell Royal at the University of Texas. He turned out to be a very bright young man. Perhaps it was his Texas confidence, or perhaps it was the result of the coaching he'd received, but he had no hesitation about sitting down and writing the oil regs we needed. [In My Time, pages 59-61]<br><br></blockquote><p>To me, the lesson of the Nixon “price control” experience is that <strong>you don’t put Richard Nixon, Donald Rumsefeld and Dick Cheney in charge of the economy.</strong> Nixon, a man who actually worked during World War Two in the Office of Price Administration, did not like his experience, and hated his coworkers. <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2953088?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Nixon even later claimed later</a> that it was this experience which led to his “lifelong” hatred of Bureaucrats, and “big government”. Like most of Nixon’s political moves, his dalliance with price controls was purely cynical, and carefully calculated. Very few policies can survive the lack of belief and lack of expertise of both the highest political official involved, and the government employees ordered to organize them. Add in the surprise, temporary nature and complexity of the task of comprehensive price controls demanded by the orthodox framework, and <strong>you have a recipe for disaster.</strong><br><br></p><p>However, direct price regulation of selected sectors that are important in price indices are far easier to accomplish with the mechanisms that already exist. They do not require price fixing for every single item, or attempts to use the tools best applied to administered price setters on markets(such as meat or oil) which are not organized by administered prices. Nor do they have to be temporary since <strong>they are aimed at managing permanent issues of market structure and market power —</strong> rather than temporary issues of excess demand. Even extremely limited price regulation can lower headline inflation, and relieve some pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.<br></p><p>Careful readers may have noticed that I focused on the sectors where the case for market power-driven price increases are the most obvious, and least controversial. I happen to think that there is a case for direct price regulation in other sectors where administered prices predominate. I will write about that more in the future—but for now interested readers can check out my chapter<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-labor-in-competition-law/DA27B8F42F54C30605087123FD6F6E72?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> in the Cambridge Handbook of Labor in Competition Law, with Luke Herrine</a>. I think <strong>price regulation can work in these other sectors, too.</strong> But how these markets are organized will likely need to be fundamentally changed for regulation to be most effective. For our purposes today, what matters is that—despite what you have heard—<strong>price regulation has a role to play in saving the Federal Reserve from its own policy mistakes.</strong></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/14_5-tdqVNcr8EZczI09WQnXB7lyM_lxl/view?usp=sharing&ref=crisesnotes.com\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Printer Friendly Version</a></div>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/dont-let-dick-cheney-ruin-price-regulation-too/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"42c65560-109b-45b7-a53b-d8f5be9e303b","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"62d0214b693255003d2a2c99","reading_time":10}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"July 5","id":"Ghost__Post__62c3fa50693255003d2950b5","title":"Prices, Prices, Prices.

At this point there is a lot to talk about, to say the least. In\nfact, part of what has taken this piece so long is any time I got a handle of\nall I wanted to say, yet another layer of the conversation emerged. I had made a\nlot of progress in fleshing out everything I wanted to say and then… Russia\ninvaded Ukraine. I will discuss some of the implications that have for these\nissues later, but there is so much more of interest to say about\nsanctions—especially from a financial regulation perspective.\n\nBefore getting started though, it is important to cover some basics. You may\nhear commentators refer to something called the “price level” and/or talk about\ninflation like it is just one thing. I won’t get into whether inflation is even\na useful concept here (you can read this piece\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/are-general-price-level-indices-theoretically/] to\nget some introductions to my thoughts). But for the purposes of this piece, what\nI am interested in focusing on is the actual price indices published by several\ngovernment statistical agencies. In the United States the main important\nconsumer price indices are the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and the Personal\nConsumption Expenditures price index (PCE). These indexes are published by the\nBureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, respectively.\n\n\nFor our immediate relevant purposes—and most importantly for political\npurposes—movements in these indices are “inflation”. You may see commentators,\nespecially orthodox economists, say that x or y movement in a price index “isn’t\ninflation”. We are just going to ignore attempts to define some idealized\nconception of inflation, separated from the actual measurement of price averages \n\n\nThis is important to clarify because it helps us set aside two types of\narguments that mirror each other. One type of argument tries to set aside\n“idiosyncratic” factors—such as the pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nThese affect a few categories of prices much more than others and thus- so the\nargument goes- are not related to “inflation”. At some point I’d like to devote\nan entire piece to the concept of “categories” in price indices. But for now\nwhat is important is that the price of different products are not inherently\ncomparable. You will be looked at strangely if you say “the average price of a\ntelevision/banana is 400 dollars”. Price indices solve this problem by weighting \ndifferent products, by how much the “average” household spends on that consumer\ngood. But this method makes “inflation” sensitive to the approach towards\nweighting, and makes certain prices (such as rents) very important to the\nbehavior of the overall price index.\n\n\nNotwithstanding that point, the second type of argument claims that there really\nis no such thing as particular factors which impact some categories much more\nthan others. Instead, particular factors are a kind of “superficial\nsmokescreen”, that papers over the “fundamental” factors that are supposedly\ndriving “inflation”. You may think that, among other things, a shortage of\nmicrochips has created unique bottlenecks in car production that have\nparticularly impacted the used car market. Therefore in the absence of a\nmicrochip shortage, measured CPI or PCE would have been lower. The defenders of\nthe second argument posit that since “inflation” is generated by overall demand\nconditions (or more infrequently, “the money supply''), the elimination of\nparticular bottlenecks won’t actually “positively” impact the overall Consumer\nPrice Index.\n\n\nThe economic fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a major challenge \nto both these sorts of arguments. Many commentators may wish to dismiss the\neconomic consequences of sanctions on Russia, and the devastation of Ukrainian\nproduction (and exports) as not part of “inflation”. But in both economic policy\nand in politics, “inflation” has no existence outside of these measured indices. \nThe Federal Reserve itself is almost certainly raising interest rates faster and\nhigher than it would otherwise if the invasion had not happened. That is because\nof how it interprets its “price stability” mandate. Of course, at the most basic\nlevel, these price increases still impact ordinary households—even if some\ncommentators want to conceptually distinguish them from “inflation”.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the flipside, the rise of energy and food prices in response to this latest\ncrisis highlights what journalist Matthew Klein\n[https://theovershoot.co/p/understanding-covid-flation] has been highlighting\nfor a long time now—even before the Russian attack the “excess” growth in CPI\nwas almost completely attributable to food (largely meat), energy and “motor\nvehicle related” prices. (See Klein’s excellent chart above). That is without\neven considering the potential knock on price increases from energy costs rising\nfor businesses operating in other industries. Some commentators attribute higher\ninflation in 2021 and early 2022 to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\n[https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text]. But why\nwould the “real” cause of these earlier price increases be a generalized\n“excess” demand when the price increases appeared, in large part, in food and\nenergy. By contrast, price increases in mostly the same sectors are suddenly\nexplicable by supply chain disruptions in the aftermath of war in Eastern\nEurope. The war in Ukraine is horrible. However, there is not a very strong case\nto be made that it has been more disruptive to supply chains than the Covid\npandemic.\n\n\nThese points nonetheless bring me into conflict with some of the progressive and\ncenter left narratives that have surfaced in the past year about inflation. In\ngeneral, I don’t find it shocking or implausible that corporations have pricing\npower that  they can successfully deploy to raise profit margins and prices (at\nleast in certain circumstances). However, “potentially plausible” and “the\nempirically identifiable cause of faster price index growth” are two different\nthings. As I’ve just laid out, the price increases accelerating growth in the\nconsumer price index have mostly not been in sectors with “administered prices”.\nIn other words, not in the sectors where prices are determined by companies \nsetting a price for weeks, months, or even years, at a time, and held constant\nfor a significant number of transactions. Even motor vehicles, which do see\nadministered prices, are unique in that there is a submarket for “used cars”\nmanaged by dealers. This secondhand market sees sudden and large price increases\nthat affect the administered price decisions of car manufacturers (who have\nimportant relationships with those same dealers).\n\n\nThe rest of these markets are, for the most part, managed by formal exchange\nmarkets (such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange). These exchange markets see\nday by day traded prices become a reference price for both wholesale and\nconsumer prices. These markets are jointly managed by financial firms and the\nrules the chartered exchanges administer themselves. Many critiques can be made\nof how these markets are managed—but undeniably, their dynamics are not clearly\nexplained by discrete pricing decisions by corporations. There is a case to be\nmade that a market like meatpacking in the United States (for instance) is\nmostly run by the major meat companies like Cargill or Tyson. But even here, the\nimpact on prices is debatable. Before the pandemic, the main progressive\ncritique of meatpackers [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_hCLjUrK1E] was that\nthey were holding down meat prices for upstream producers, by locking them into\nlong term contracts, and keeping cattle from auctions. Now it may be the case\nthat if the meat industry were restructured, meat packing profit margins would\nfall. But it's very questionable whether meat price growth would have been lower\nduring the pandemic if cattle were returned to the auction price determination\nprocess (which inherently benefits sellers.)\n\n\nThis all being said, it is the case that during at least the first 18 months of\nthe pandemic many corporations experienced significantly elevated profits. Some\nmay look at that and think that contradicts what I am saying, asking: “didn’t\nthose profits come from higher prices?”. I don’t think so. As I explained early\non in the pandemic [https://www.crisesnotes.com/where-do-profits-come-from/],\ntotal profits across all businesses come from a few major sources. One of those\nsources is the government budget balance. Given the large expansion of\ngovernment budget deficits, we should expect higher aggregate profits—regardless\nof specific pricing decisions made by companies. Those profits went up as the\ngovernment temporarily took on business expenses, with programs like the Payroll\nProtection Program. Programs like unemployment insurance provided income to\nnewly unemployed workers (who thus were no longer business expenses either). The\ninfamous “stimulus” checks provided income across the board, to workers and\nnon-workers alike. Both groups spent this income on goods and services sold by\nbusinesses. With these drops in expenses and jump in sales, it's no surprise\nthat profits went up.\n\n\nOne could argue that if companies had “passed on” those higher profits into\nlower prices, overall inflation would have been lower. Some have made a version\n[https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/corporate-profits-drive-60-of-inflation] of\nthis argument. I do not find it very convincing. In the first place, some of \nthose profits came from programs that—implicitly or explicitly—were standing in\nfor retained earnings by companies. These companies didn’t have big enough\n“rainy day” funds to get through the pandemic, and so the government stepped in.\nIs it really the best policy to instantly unwind those savings, just as they got\nbuilt up? Now we can always make the case that far too much profit is being put\ninto dividend payments, stock buybacks and merger and acquisitions. But\nfinancial regulation aimed at forcing businesses to save for a rainy day (an\noption I discussed at the beginning of the pandemic\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/should-we-force-businesses-to-save/]) would still\nnot leave room for cutting target profit margins, in order to lower prices.\nRebalancing away from these alternative uses of cash towards more corporate\nsavings will not solve the “pricing problem”. \n\nFurthermore, in the midst of a pandemic it is unrealistic to expect companies\nnot to prepare for the obvious contingencies that may emerge such as\ngeopolitical instability created by the pandemic such as… well… a war in\nUkraine. These problems emerge without even mentioning that there were very good\nreasons to expect this boost in sales not to last. It is important to keep in\nmind that pricing is forward looking. You set a price, and thus a target profit\nmargin today, in the hopes of having successful financial results in the future.\nCutting target profit margins (or alternatively boosting the estimates of\nbudgeted output) in the expectation that sales growth will be sustained can\neasily lead to financial disaster when sales growth slows, or even reverses. If\nbefore the pandemic companies didn’t already have a sense of how quickly\nmacroeconomic trends can turn against them, the pandemic certainly taught that\nlesson very harshly. \n\n\nThis one time shot of “deficit driven” cash couldn’t sustain lower prices\nindefinitely—if it were even possible to coordinate among companies in the first\nplace. The data that many organizations are relying on to claim that companies\nhave been “price gouging” is financial accounting data of a company’s overall\nresults. The “average profit margin” in financial accounting data is simply\ntotal profits, divided by sales. This is not very informative about much of\nanything: it doesn’t even tell us if companies are raising their target profit\nmargins at the individual product level. In order to provide oversight and\njudgment of business pricing decisions, we need managerial accounting data that\ndelves down to the individual product level. \n\n\nComplicating things further, “cost based” price increases can lead to better\nfinancial results. That’s because businesses generally set profit margins on a\npercentage basis, rather than in dollar terms. In other words, if you set a\nprofit margin on diapers that is 6% of your budgeted average total costs then\nany increase in budgeted average total cost will increase the dollar amount of\nyour profit margin—even though the percentage stays the same. We can debate\nwhether that is an appropriate approach to pricing that is in the public\ninterest. However, the company interest in not having percentage profit margins\nshrinking consistently over time is obvious.\n\n\nNone of this means that we shouldn’t regulate corporately administered prices (I\nwill comment on various proposals for that in the future). Nor does it mean that\nincreasing target profit margins may not be a more significant source of price\nindex growth over the next few years. The fact that there is so much we still\ndon’t know is reason enough to create regulations which make the decisions—and\nthe cost data—of corporate pricing committees far more transparent and open to\ncritical scrutiny. What it does mean is that the answers to these questions are\nnot as simple as they may seem on the surface. So there will need to be a two\npronged approach to managing prices: one which takes the institutional\ndifferences between formal exchange prices and corporately administered prices\nseriously.\n\nPrinter Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i220F9XzZXIIJ6QgTCFaMvHm3Xx-jSKM/view?usp=sharing]","html":"<p><em>This is a premium piece of Notes on the Crises</em></p><p>I haven’t covered what’s been going on in pricing and the “inflation” conversation. At this point there is a lot to talk about, to say the least. In fact, part of what has taken this piece so long is any time I got a handle of all I wanted to say, yet another layer of the conversation emerged. I had made a lot of progress in fleshing out everything I wanted to say and then… Russia invaded Ukraine. I will discuss some of the implications that have for these issues later, but there is so much more of interest to say about sanctions—especially from a financial regulation perspective.</p><p>Before getting started though, it is important to cover some basics. You may hear commentators refer to something called the “price level” and/or talk about inflation like it is just one thing. I won’t get into whether inflation is even a useful concept here (you can <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/are-general-price-level-indices-theoretically/\">read this piece</a> to get some introductions to my thoughts). But for the purposes of this piece, what I am interested in focusing on is the <strong>actual price indices published by several government statistical agencies.</strong> In the United States the main important consumer price indices are the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index (PCE). These indexes are published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, respectively.<br></p><p>For our immediate relevant purposes—and most importantly for political purposes—movements in these indices are “inflation”. You may see commentators, especially orthodox economists, say that x or y movement in a price index “isn’t inflation”. We are just going to ignore attempts to define some idealized conception of inflation, separated from the actual measurement of price averages <br></p><p>This is important to clarify because it helps us set aside two types of arguments that mirror each other. One type of argument tries to set aside “idiosyncratic” factors—such as the pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These affect a few categories of prices much more than others and thus- so the argument goes- are not related to “inflation”. At some point I’d like to devote an entire piece to the concept of “categories” in price indices. But for now what is important is that the price of different products are not inherently comparable. You will be looked at strangely if you say “the average price of a television/banana is 400 dollars”. Price indices solve this problem by <em>weighting</em> different products, by how much the “average” household spends on that consumer good. But this method makes “inflation” sensitive to the approach towards weighting, and makes certain prices (such as rents) very important to the behavior of the overall price index.<br></p><p>Notwithstanding that point, the second type of argument claims that there r<strong>eally is no such thing as particular factor</strong>s which impact some categories much more than others. Instead, particular factors are a kind of “superficial smokescreen”, that papers over the “fundamental” factors that are supposedly driving “inflation”. You may think that, among other things, a shortage of microchips has created unique bottlenecks in car production that have particularly impacted the used car market. Therefore in the absence of a microchip shortage, measured CPI or PCE would have been lower. The defenders of the second argument posit that since “inflation” is generated by overall demand conditions (or more infrequently, “the money supply''), the elimination of particular bottlenecks won’t actually “positively” impact the overall Consumer Price Index.<br></p><p>The <strong>economic fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a major challenge</strong> to both these sorts of arguments. Many commentators may wish to dismiss the economic consequences of sanctions on Russia, and the devastation of Ukrainian production (and exports) as not part of “inflation”. But in both economic policy and in politics, <strong>“inflation” has no existence outside of these measured indices.</strong> The Federal Reserve itself is almost certainly raising interest rates faster and higher than it would otherwise if the invasion had not happened. That is because of how it interprets its “price stability” mandate. Of course, at the most basic level, these price increases still impact ordinary households—even if some commentators want to conceptually distinguish them from “inflation”.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ST4ngOWZ7OPswVNp9Ak7o9AjcsoJypTuEv3IyxFUm_d7OpObJS09DH8P-B9qryhZ4CDFAo-D_waP1swqJaB_K_p7K0ClcLoktQrytRo4Tom--UAXQREM-i7K2Ms-OmK0iJA0J95zngcZUL98e64\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><br></p><p>On the flipside, the rise of energy and food prices in response to this latest crisis highlights what <a href=\"https://theovershoot.co/p/understanding-covid-flation?ref=crisesnotes.com\">journalist Matthew Klein</a> has been highlighting for a long time now—even before the Russian attack the “excess” growth in CPI was almost completely attributable to food (largely meat), energy and “motor vehicle related” prices. (See Klein’s excellent chart above). That is without even considering the potential knock on price increases from energy costs rising for businesses operating in other industries. Some commentators attribute higher inflation in 2021 and early 2022 to the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text?ref=crisesnotes.com\">American Rescue Plan Act of 2021</a>. But why would the “real” cause of these earlier price increases be a generalized “excess” demand when the price increases appeared, in large part, in food and energy. By contrast, price increases in mostly the same sectors are suddenly explicable by supply chain disruptions in the aftermath of war in Eastern Europe. The war in Ukraine is horrible. However, there is not a very strong case to be made that it has been more disruptive to supply chains than the Covid pandemic.<br></p><p>These points nonetheless bring me into conflict with some of the progressive and center left narratives that have surfaced in the past year about inflation. In general, I don’t find it shocking or implausible that corporations have pricing power that  they can successfully deploy to raise profit margins and prices (at least in certain circumstances). However, “potentially plausible” and “the empirically identifiable cause of faster price index growth” are <strong>two different things.</strong> As I’ve just laid out, the price increases accelerating growth in the consumer price index have mostly not been in sectors with “administered prices”. In other words, not in the sectors where prices are determined by companies <strong>setting a price for weeks, months, or even years, at a time,</strong> and held constant for a significant number of transactions. Even motor vehicles, which do see administered prices, are unique in that there is a submarket for “used cars” managed by dealers. This secondhand market sees sudden and large price increases that affect the administered price decisions of car manufacturers (who have important relationships with those same dealers).<br></p><p>The rest of these markets are, for the most part, managed by formal exchange markets (such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange). These exchange markets see day by day traded prices become a reference price for both wholesale and consumer prices. These markets are jointly managed by financial firms and the rules the chartered exchanges administer themselves. Many critiques can be made of how these markets are managed—but undeniably, their dynamics are not clearly explained by discrete pricing decisions by corporations. There is a case to be made that a market like meatpacking in the United States (for instance) is mostly run by the major meat companies like Cargill or Tyson. But even here, the impact on prices is debatable. Before the pandemic, the main <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_hCLjUrK1E&ref=crisesnotes.com\">progressive critique of meatpackers</a> was that they were <em>holding down</em> meat prices for upstream producers, by locking them into long term contracts, and keeping cattle from auctions. Now it may be the case that if the meat industry were restructured, meat packing profit margins would fall. But it's <strong>very questionable whether meat price growth would have been lower during the pandemic</strong> if cattle were returned to the auction price determination process (which inherently benefits sellers.)<br></p><p>This all being said, it is the case that during at least the first 18 months of the pandemic many corporations experienced significantly elevated profits. Some may look at that and think that contradicts what I am saying, asking: “didn’t those profits come from higher prices?”. I don’t think so. As I explained <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/where-do-profits-come-from/\">early on in the pandemic</a>, total profits across all businesses come from a few major sources. One of those sources is the government budget balance. Given the large expansion of government budget deficits, we should expect higher aggregate profits—regardless of specific pricing decisions made by companies. Those profits went up as the government temporarily took on business expenses, with programs like the Payroll Protection Program. Programs like unemployment insurance provided income to newly unemployed workers (who thus were no longer business expenses either). The infamous “stimulus” checks provided income across the board, to workers and non-workers alike. Both groups spent this income on goods and services sold by businesses. With these drops in expenses and jump in sales, it's no surprise that profits went up.<br></p><p>One could argue that if companies had “passed on” those higher profits into lower prices, overall inflation would have been lower. <a href=\"https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/corporate-profits-drive-60-of-inflation?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Some have made a version</a> of this argument. I do not find it very convincing. In the first place, some of <strong>those profits came from programs that—implicitly or explicitly—were standing in for retained earnings</strong> by companies. These companies didn’t have big enough “rainy day” funds to get through the pandemic, and so the government stepped in. Is it really the best policy to instantly unwind those savings, just as they got built up? Now we can always make the case that far too much profit is being put into dividend payments, stock buybacks and merger and acquisitions. But financial regulation aimed at forcing businesses to save for a rainy day <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/should-we-force-businesses-to-save/\">(an option I discussed at the beginning of the pandemic</a>) would still not leave room for cutting target profit margins, in order to lower prices.

Ferreira Lima, a law professor at the University of Leeds, and Chris Marsh, a macroeconomist at Exante Data, about their paper questioning the legality of the International Monetary Fund’s 2018 program in Argentina. The interview runs through the important background history to the IMF’s most recent Argentine program, the questionable changes which have been made to the IMF’s operating procedures in the past few decades and the legal constraints which are supposed to exist for IMF programs. Our guests went on to explain the specifics of the 2018 stand-by arrangement with the IMF and the reasons they think this program was particularly egregious economically, to the point of being illegal.

Regular\nreaders will know that insights from MMT inform all my writing on this\nnewsletter on various different topics. But I prefer to focus on my analysis of\nunfolding situations, rather than arguing about the framework that lies behind\nmy thinking. Nonetheless, in other contexts this is an important part of my\nwork. I am the research director of the Modern Money Network, after all. A major\nproject that I took on as lead author preceding the pandemic came out of the\ndebate over MMT in 2019. (As an introduction to Modern Monetary Theory, I wrote\nout a talk on the subject originally delivered to a Federal Credit Union, which \nyou can find here\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-gave-a-talk-to-a-federal-credit/])\n\nIt is hard to remember those long ago days but, at the time, the debate about\nModern Monetary Theory was over whether it makes sense to say that inflation and\nthe availability of physical resources was the main constraint to expansionary\nfiscal policy. In contrast, mainstream commentators came out of the woodwork to\nsay no, if you run deficits that are too big, even if there isn’t an issue with\ninflation, the national debt will get out of control and bond markets will\n“punish” you. Some even claimed that the Trump tax cuts meant that the U.S. had\n“run out of ammo” for the next recession. In their framing, fiscal policy was\nsupposed to manage the national debt and monetary policy — specifically interest\nrate policy — was supposed to manage the economy and preserve full employment\nplus price stability. \n\n\nMore sophisticated commentators claimed that MMT may be right — but it didn’t\nmatter much. Josh Barro, who was at New York Magazine at the time, claimed:\n\nIf the government prints and spends money when the economy is at or near full\nemployment, MMT counsels (correctly) that this will lead to inflation, and\nprescribes deficit-reducing tax increases to reduce aggregate demand and thereby\ncontrol inflation. See how we have ended up back where we started? Whether you\ntake a Keynesian view or an MMT view, if the government spends more, it’s likely\ngoing to need to tax more, sooner or later. [...] Whatever the Federal Reserve’s\ndemerits, the idea of depending on Congress to pass surplus-generating tax\nincreases in order to keep the economy stable and prevent runaway inflation\ngives me hives.\n\nBarro’s piece signaled that we were in a new phase of the debate. While many\nmainstream economists embarrassingly held onto the idea of the national debt\n“spiraling out of control”, it was clear that more and more commentators would\ngravitate to Barro’s idea. They came to argue that it doesn’t matter much\nwhether you are “balancing the budget” or “budgeting for inflation”. \n\n\nMy colleagues and I saw various dangers in this new framing. For one thing,\nwhile we thought a focus on inflation and physical resources was a vast\nimprovement over a focus on the size of the national debt, we had a very\ndifferent view of prices and aggregate demand than mainstream commentators.\nPolicymakers who naively focused on headline inflation could miss key\nbottlenecks in specific sectors which wouldn’t be solved by throttling demand \n(whether that throttling came from fiscal policy or monetary policy). Further,\nthere are a variety of cost-based and market structure-grounded reasons that\nprices can increase when output is widely available. \n\n\nEven when aggregate demand and income growth is the main cause of shortages and\nprice increases, it does not follow that the only possible response is raising\ntaxes or fiscal policy. Restrictive financial regulation, or even non-financial\nregulation can restrict demand (that’s a point I will return to). Later on, I\nwould coin the phrase “non-fiscal payfors” to emphasize that in “demand terms”,\nexpansionary fiscal policy could be “offset” by restrictive non-fiscal policy\nrather than tax increases or other spending cuts. Contra Barro, this is a very\ndifferent world than the one envisioned by mainstream economic policy or the\npartisan economists who populate its conventional wisdom.\n\n\n\nTo head off Barro’s view becoming the new conventional wisdom and preemptively\nclarify these misunderstandings (as well as confusions I discuss below), UMKC\nprofessor Scott Fullwiler, MMN president (and now professor) Rohan Grey and I\nwrote an op-ed for the Financial Times\n[https://www.ft.com/content/539618f8-b88c-3125-8031-cf46ca197c64]. In\ndiscussions with our colleagues at the organization Our Money, it became clear\nthat they were interested in financing a report to flesh out the idea that\ntightening financial regulation could serve as an alternative to both interest\nrate hikes and tax increases. I became lead author and spent a lot of my time in\n2019 and early 2020 leading up to the pandemic working on this report. Thanks to\nmy colleagues at the Modern Money Network, particularly Michael Brennan, I am\nproud to announce that “The New Monetary Policy: Reimagining Demand Management\nand Price Stability in the 21st Century”\n[https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf] is finished and ready for\npublic consumption.\n\n\nThe New Monetary Policy is focused on how the budgeting — and policymaking —\napproaches used by government agencies, particularly the Congressional Budget\nOffice, would need to change and adjust in order to incorporate and take full\nadvantage of non-fiscal payfors. It examines the various different elements of\ncontemporary financial regulation and considers which financial regulatory tools\nwould be most suited to managing demand. Finally, it recommends two suites of\nfinancial regulatory tools, geared towards different political contexts. One\nsuite, dubbed the “Build Back Better” approach, focuses on how financial\nregulation could come to serve a demand management role without major\ndisruptions to the current approaches to budgeting and monetary policy. It is\nmeant to exemplify that policymakers can benefit from MMT insights about\nmanaging aggregate demand without signing up to a Permanent Zero Interest Rate\non Government debt (PZIRG) policy.\n\n\nOur more “aggressive” policy suite, dubbed “Green New Deal” monetary policy, is\nmeant to show the kind of demand-management tools available via financial\nregulation if policymakers (and the public) become interested in freeing up a\nvast array of physical resources for Green New Deal mobilization. We also\nemphasize that avoiding U.S. interest rate hikes is especially important in the\ncontext of the United States, where dollar interest rates impact countries\ndeeply indebted in dollars, both in dollar terms and in terms of their exchange\nrates. Whether it is the pandemic response or the climate response, raising\ndollar interest rates is inconsistent with tackling these global problems on a\nglobal scale. The planned Federal Reserve interest rate hikes are already having\nadverse impacts on much of the rest of the world.\n\n\nThere is much more in The New Monetary Policy than I can go over here. That’s\nwhy readers should read it! One thing, however, that the report is not about is\nour current “inflation” situation. As I stated earlier, it was mostly written in\n2019 and has only been updated in the places where contemporary circumstances\nare the most critical to the argument. While we flesh out more of our thoughts\nabout the “non-demand” elements of inflation and price stability, that topic is\nnot the main focus of this report. The role that competition law and other areas\nof law that directly impact business price-making have in aiming for a true full\nemployment economy with price stability is a subject that deserves its own paper\nor report. My work with colleagues Sanjukta Paul\n[https://files.crisesnotes.com/universityofstthomaslawjournal.pdf] and Luke\nHerrine [https://files.crisesnotes.com/labourincompetitionlaw.pdf] will\ncertainly play a key role in a full developed framework answering those\nquestions. In the meantime, I am going to write about recent arguments over this\ntopic later this week, and the more general arguments over pandemic-related\nprice increases.\n\nWhat I can say here is that the pandemic has vindicated many of these points.\nConcerns over where the United States would “find the money” (rather than\n“finding the resources”) for various fiscal initiatives dissolved in the\npandemic as the Federal Reserve launched an array of programs (which I became\nwell known for). Congress also passed trillions of dollars in spending\ninitiatives without offsets of any kind. In fact, just yesterday Professor\nStephanie Kelton was profiled in a New York Times Profile entitled “Time For a\nVictory Lap*\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/business/economy/modern-monetary-theory-stephanie-kelton.html]\n” on this exact point. Meanwhile, the pandemic became a major real world example\nof non-financial regulation contracting demand throughout the economy. In other\nwords, pandemic measures reduce demand which actually required expansionary\nfiscal policy to “offset”.\n\n\nAs if this all were not enough, our concern that the mainstream view that\ninflation is only caused by excess aggregate demand would mean particular supply\nchain bottlenecks would be used to justify demand restraint has been prescient.\nThe business press is now daily focused on the intimate details of supply\nchains. That new focus is based on the idea that you need to understand those\nintricacies to understand wider economic conditions, and what would be the most\neffective policy response. \n\n\nWe were worried about how these potential future bottlenecks would play out\npolitically at a time when few other commentators were focused on such issues.\nNow president Biden commonsensically says\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-04/biden-rebrands-reagan-s-supply-side-economics-to-save-build-back-better-agenda]\n: “if car prices are too high right now, there are two solutions: You increase\nthe supply of cars by making more of them, or you reduce demand for cars by\nmaking Americans poorer.” Naturally, he concludes he endorses the former.\nBiden’s Federal Reserve, however, still appears poised to pursue the latter.\n\n\nThe New Monetary Policy is a major step in laying out an alternative to the\northodox policy consensus — and I look forward to producing more work in the\nfuture that fleshes out that alternative even more.\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]Printer Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TdEA9E3mJOt-dBJzVnn3eL8dG_1BNZJC/view?usp=sharing]","html":"<div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>I don’t spend a lot of time writing about Modern Monetary Theory on <em>Notes on the Crises</em>.

(See Adam Tooze’s reflection on the broken metaphor of ‘China’s Chernobyl’ \nin our last podcast.\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/notes-on-the-crises-podcast-2-adam-tooze-talks-shutdown/]\n) Our failures to respond to problems preemptively will soon mean greater\ndamage, death and destruction.

This simple truth may\nbe difficult to accept, because the contrary\n[https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2022/01/27/the-nyts-polarizing-pandemic-pundit-00003059] \nis so often stated. At multiple times last year the Biden administration\nattempted to declare the pandemic over. When they declared that Coronavirus is\nbecoming a “pandemic of the unvaccinated”, that was another iteration of trying\nto put the pandemic “behind us”.  Many mainstream news outlets have implied that\nCovid is either under control, or soon will be. Stubbornly, the pandemic has not\nlistened. \n\n\nThis campaign of denialism has now reached the point that we have pushed the\nhealthcare system far over capacity, and the Biden administration has still\nshown no interest in any mitigation efforts that are not simply vaccination.\nEven vaccination itself has not involved the outreach work that, say, the census\ninvolves i.e. door knocking and opening physical offices across the country\nwhere you can talk to an informed representative about your questions and\nconcerns. In fairness to the Biden administration, the mere suggestion of door\nknocking by president Biden was met with outrage by the governor of Missouri\n[https://fox4kc.com/news/missouri-news/gov-parson-pushes-back-on-federal-door-to-door-vaccination-campaign-in-missouri/]\n. However, trying nothing because trying things will encounter strong political\nresistance when this many lives are on the line is not leadership and there is\nno reason those of us on the sidelines should accept that kind of reasoning.\n\n\n\nAnd make no mistake, many lives are on the line. Far from coming to a close in\nthe short term, Covid is an on-going and worsening crisis too many are hoping to\nwish away. According to the New York Times\n[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html], the 7 day death\naverage in the United States is about 2500 deaths a day. That is a truly\nstaggering amount. That is not far off from the peak of deaths in the winter of\n2020-2021. The number of people hospitalized with Covid has started to trend\ndown but is still a staggering 146,000 people. The peak in winter 2020-2021 was\n136,000 people. Partial vaccination and a complete lack of mitigation measures\ndo not end pandemics even though vaccination provides strong protection to\nindividuals. Denying this doesn’t make Covid disappear, nor does it make the\nsocial ramifications of Coronavirus disappear.\n\n\n\nIn this context I have had trouble joining the month to month coverage of the\nFederal Reserve’s actions, and the discussion of where we are at relative to\n“full employment”. In my view a great many commentators are mistaking\ncircumstances where service workers are responding to workplaces which have\nbecome dramatically more unsafe and unpleasant, for a “strong” labor market\nwhere workers have true bargaining power. It is true that employers have had to\nraise wage rates to have even a minimal chance to attract workers — but they\nhave budged on working conditions far less. This is in part because working\nconditions are more of a matter of collective standards and it is very hard to\nget agreement on protections which are not widely accepted across workplaces.\nThe controversy over “school closings” reflects this. Pundits rhetorically\ninveigh against closing schools when community (and school) transmission spikes\nby pointing to the lack of protections (or closures) at bars and restaurants. \n\n\nA highly unionized profession with higher standards for workplace safety has\nextreme difficulty defending itself when there exists a low wage workforce where\nworking conditions can collapse without social response. As a result, teacher\nunions have largely made concessions on worker conditions and earlier agreements\nto tie whether school would be “remote” or not to community transmission rates.\nIronically, this has simply meant school closures anyway as the Omicron surge\ncaused staff shortages that made in-person school impossible.\n\n\nWhether you agree with my view of the “school closure” debate, the point is that\naggregate wage and employment rate measures about the health of “the economy”\nfor ordinary workers are much more misleading in the midst of a pandemic where\nwe lack similarly high quality working conditions measures. This is, in part,\nbecause working conditions are a qualitative factor rather than something\nmeasured in dollars or hours worked. It is also simply because we have not\ninvested sufficient  resources into producing measures of the quality of\nworkplaces. Those wage gains for lower waged workers still matter of course.\nThey also likely will not reverse when the pandemic is over. But they are a\nbarometer of how bad conditions are, not a conventionally “improving” labor\nmarket.\nZooming out even more, we can note that the pandemic is still going on globally.\nThe global vaccination effort has been minimally resourced, at best. There have\nbeen, for example, no issuance of SDRs\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/listen-fed-the-imf-needs-access-to/] by the IMF or\nlarge grants from the United States. Instead, the U.S. is planning on raising\ninterest rates which is already tightening dollar financial conditions (and thus\nexchange rates) for countries that are already overstretched in their pandemic\nresponse. This is also another sense where the term “crises” applies.\nCoronavirus is not simply one “crisis”, but many interlocking ones. It is hard\nto even keep track of all the different “Coronavirus crises”. Ending all of\nthese Coronavirus crises will take far more concerted and global effort than is\nbeing made and the desire (especially among U.S. elites)  to wish it all away\nonly extends them further. Of course, the same applies to climate change as\nwell.

This is huge because we have very\nlittle national level evidence on evictions. As Dr. Haoyang Liu, and Dr. Zhang\nsay in their July 2020 blog post on the topic\n[https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/07/who-has-been-evicted-and-why/]\n:\n\n> Despite the importance of evictions and related policies, very few economic\nstudies have been done on this topic. With the exception of the Milwaukee Area\nRenters Study\n[https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mdesmond/files/desmondshollenberger.demography.2015.pdf]\n, evictions are rarely measured in economic surveys. To fill this gap, we\nconducted a novel national survey on evictions within the Housing Module of the\nSurvey of Consumer Expectations (SCE)\n[https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce/housing#main] in 2019 and 2020\nThat 2020 survey was conducted in February 2020, so it serves as a valuable\nbaseline for what began happening afterwards. But in itself that survey doesn’t\ntell us much about the overall pandemic experience. Nonetheless, it's worth\nreading in full. Some valuable information it provides us is some sense of the\nexperience with evictions in the population as a whole and among renters:\n\n> More than 24 percent of households know someone who has been evicted and about 4\npercent of households have been evicted themselves. These rates are\nsubstantially higher for current renters, with 37 percent knowing someone\nevicted since 2006 and 9 percent having an eviction history. For homeowners,\nthese shares are 21 percent and 2 percent, respectively.\nIt had been a while since I corresponded with the researchers who included these\neviction questions in the housing module of the survey of consumer expectations.\nSince then, I hadn’t seen anything come from the “Liberty Street” blog, so this\nweek I decided to get back in contact with another email. They informed me that\nthey had not included any eviction questions in the 2021 survey. I followed up,\nsurprised, asking why and was told by one researcher that:\n\n> One reason was that given the eviction moratorium, evictions would have been\nrare.\nI find this reasoning weak, to say the least. As their own earlier blog post\nsays: “First, evictions can happen outside\n[https://evictionlab.org/methods/#all-evictions]of the court system. Some\nevidence even suggests that more than half of evictions are informal, without\nbeing ordered by a court”. Out-of-Court evictions would likely be more important \nunder an eviction moratorium which would make the inclusion of eviction\nquestions more important. Even worse, because the CDC eviction moratorium \nrequired atestation by renters\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/fiscal-cliffication-continues-as/] (and, in\naddition, their awareness of the CDC eviction protection), court evictions were\nstill very possible. It would be nice to have evidence for how many court\nevictions still happened, and for how long it took the word to get out about CDC\neviction protection. \n\n\nThe missing eviction questions are also strange because the “Federal Reserve\nBank of New York’s Community Development Unit” has been extensively covering the\n“eviction crisis”. They’ve also put out white papers\n[https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/regional_outreach/2021/20210923] on\neffective eviction protection, where they bemoan the lack of data. I expect they\nwould have ideas for producing consistent eviction-related housing data in their\nown survey. That would also serve to provide evidence for the effect of the\neviction moratorium as moratoriums expire and the pandemic does (or does not)\nrecede. In other words, including the eviction questions in 2021 would\nfacilitate asking these questions again in 2022. Let alone conducting the survey\nmore frequently in the midst of an eviction crisis.\n\n\nI debated back and forth with myself for sometime about whether I should write\nthis piece. These researchers have been very forthright and helpful in\ncommunications with me. I appreciate the data that their past surveys provide,\nand think they helpfully contribute to our understanding of evictions. I also\nhave no idea whether they decided not to include these questions, or whether\nthat decision was made on a budgetary basis above them. Nonetheless, I also\nthink it is important to hold the Federal Reserve System to account for its\nresearch decisions. I think it is a grave and baffling error to not include\neviction related questions, and not make them a regular part of the Survey of\nConsumer Expectations. I will update you if this situation changes (as I hope it\nwill!)\n\n\nAs the recent Brookings Institution survey “Gender and Racial Diversity of\nFederal Government Economists: 2020 Data” helpfully informs us:\n\nNearly 40% (879) of all Ph.D. economists who work for the federal government are\nemployed by the Federal Reserve System—roughly half at the Board of Governors\nand half at the 12 regional Fed banks\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York alone has more than 4.5 times as many Ph.D\neconomists on staff as the entire Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nThe distribution of Ph.D economists in the federal government does not reflect\nthe relative importance of the responsibilities these institutions have, but\nrather the happenstance of their budgetary process. Agencies outside of the\nFederal Reserve system largely rely on annual appropriations for their annual\nbudgets. The Federal Reserve System meanwhile has “budgetary independence”.

As Dr. Haoyang Liu, and Dr. Zhang say in their <a href=\"https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/07/who-has-been-evicted-and-why/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">July 2020 blog post on the topic</a>:</p><blockquote>Despite the importance of evictions and related policies, very few economic studies have been done on this topic. With the exception of the <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mdesmond/files/desmondshollenberger.demography.2015.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Milwaukee Area Renters Study</a>, evictions are rarely measured in economic surveys. To fill this gap, we conducted a novel national survey on evictions within the <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce/housing?ref=crisesnotes.com#main\">Housing Module of the Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE)</a> in 2019 and 2020</blockquote><p>That 2020 survey was conducted in February 2020, so it serves as a valuable baseline for what began happening afterwards. But in itself that survey doesn’t tell us much about the overall pandemic experience. Nonetheless, it's worth reading in full. Some valuable information it provides us is some sense of the experience with evictions in the population as a whole and among renters:</p><blockquote>More than 24 percent of households know someone who has been evicted and about 4 percent of households have been evicted themselves. These rates are substantially higher for current renters, with 37 percent knowing someone evicted since 2006 and 9 percent having an eviction history. For homeowners, these shares are 21 percent and 2 percent, respectively.</blockquote><p>It had been a while since I corresponded with the researchers who included these eviction questions in the housing module of the survey of consumer expectations. Since then, I hadn’t seen anything come from the “Liberty Street” blog, so this week I decided to get back in contact with another email. They informed me that they had not included <em>any</em> eviction questions in the 2021 survey. I followed up, surprised, asking why and was told by one researcher that:</p><blockquote>One reason was that given the eviction moratorium, evictions would have been rare.</blockquote><p>I find this reasoning weak, to say the least. As their own earlier blog post says: “First, evictions can happen <a href=\"https://evictionlab.org/methods/?ref=crisesnotes.com#all-evictions\">outside </a>of the court system. Some evidence even suggests that more than half of evictions are informal, without being ordered by a court”. Out-of-Court evictions would likely be <em>more important</em> under an eviction moratorium which would make the inclusion of eviction questions <em>more important</em>. Even worse, because the CDC eviction moratorium <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/fiscal-cliffication-continues-as/\">required atestation by renters</a> (and, in addition, their awareness of the CDC eviction protection), court evictions were still very possible. It would be nice to have evidence for how many court evictions still happened, and for how long it took the word to get out about CDC eviction protection. <br></p><p>The missing eviction questions are also strange because the “Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Community Development Unit” has been extensively covering the “eviction crisis”. They’ve also <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/regional_outreach/2021/20210923?ref=crisesnotes.com\">put out white papers</a> on effective eviction protection, where they bemoan the lack of data. I expect they would have ideas for producing consistent eviction-related housing data in their own survey. That would also serve to provide evidence for the <em>effect</em> of the eviction moratorium as moratoriums expire and the pandemic does (or does not) recede. In other words, including the eviction questions in 2021 would facilitate asking these questions again in 2022. Let alone conducting the survey more frequently in the midst of an eviction crisis.<br></p><p>I debated back and forth with myself for sometime about whether I should write this piece. These researchers have been very forthright and helpful in communications with me. I appreciate the data that their past surveys provide, and think they helpfully contribute to our understanding of evictions. I also have no idea whether they decided not to include these questions, or whether that decision was made on a budgetary basis above them. Nonetheless, I also think it is important to hold the Federal Reserve System to account for its research decisions.<strong> I think it is a grave and baffling error to not include eviction related questions,</strong> and not make them a regular part of the Survey of Consumer Expectations. I will update you if this situation changes (as I hope it will!)</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/RqkhHcGMHxJTiyGRONCCgAxjedi4xQNtEbNiq3-zEBJ1th5GtMTzpLYsw4GpIbE6yg8Qh2Ie1xrJw5OOOH93hGzHnEKpdIGT-PWGw613QHnVcRx8I0GCQbwB_2KqFahL4ZzG4_64\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><br>As the recent Brookings Institution survey “Gender and Racial Diversity of Federal Government Economists: 2020 Data” helpfully informs us:</p><p>Nearly 40% (879) of all Ph.D. economists who work for the federal government are employed by the Federal Reserve System—roughly half at the Board of Governors and half at the 12 regional Fed banks</p><p>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York alone has more than 4.5 times as many Ph.D economists on staff as the entire <em>Department of Housing and Urban Development</em>. The distribution of Ph.D economists in the federal government does not reflect the relative importance of the responsibilities these institutions have, but rather the happenstance of their budgetary process. Agencies outside of the Federal Reserve system largely rely on annual appropriations for their annual budgets. The Federal Reserve System meanwhile has “budgetary independence”. As <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/what-if-the-federal-reserve-just/\">I’ve discussed before</a>, this means they have wide latitude to spend as they like, primarily through using the money creation power.

Where once raising interest rates was necessary because the economy was overstimulated or labor was too rowdy, now we must raise interest rates because low interest rates are causing too much inequality. The conclusions are the same, but the arguments have been repackaged for a more class-conscious age.\n\nI have been looking for good opportunities to write about this which came in the form of a particularly straightforward and troubling Financial Times op ed from Rana Foroohar entitled “The left’s low-rate fantasy makes inequality worse”. The main through line of the article is the claim that low interest rates cause bubbles which increase inequality while playing down the effect tighter monetary policy would have on wage growth and employment at the low end of the labor force. Playing up the former while playing down the latter paints the benefits of low interest rates as “too costly”.  \n\n\nThe article throws out a number of justifications for this view. One particularly confusing line points to “academic research” showing low interest rates cause asset bubbles but links to a theoretical paper on the natural rate of interest and inequality which doesn’t discuss bubbles. This is the only real justification for the assertion in the article. Plenty of debt fueled bouts of asset price increases have continued amid high interest rates and rising interest rates. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes from August 2004 to August 2006 did little to cool the U.S. housing market. That’s no surprise when banks were systematically committing fraud in order to gain double digit returns. How high does Foroohar want the U.S. to raise interest rates?\n\n\nThis question becomes particularly urgent since she implies that she wants the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in order to crash the cryptocurrency market:\n\nWith stock prices still near record highs, and US home prices up nearly 20 per cent annually, it’s no wonder that small-time investors are desperate for their slice of the pie. Income growth won’t buy you a house. And yet, risk is greatest just when the punchbowl is about to be pulled. I worry about the rise of retail speculation on apps such as Robinhood. I also worry that investors with fewer liquid assets are those taking on some of the biggest risks. Consider a recent Harris poll showing that 15 per cent of Latino Americans and 25 per cent of African Americans say they’ve purchased non-fungible tokens, compared with just 8 per cent of white Americans.\n\nFirst, it must be emphasized that taking this Harris poll at face value strains credulity past its breaking point. There is simply no way that 1 in 4 Black people own an NFT and that the proportion of Black people who own an NFT is triple the proportion of white people who do. If you look at the actual poll it helpfully informs closer readers that: “[t]his online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. Figures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region and household income were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population.” In other words, there isn’t a margin for error- there’s a chasm of possible error. It is painfully obvious that crypto fans who responded to an online poll mentioning crypto and “non-response bias” from non-cryptocurrency holders blew up the results.\n\n\nThe misuse of this poll in this argument is however, in some sense, a distraction. The more fundamental problem here is the idea that raising interest rates to 4 or 5 percent will kill interest in cryptocurrencies, a space which has seen extreme levels of volatility and returns. Someone who hears tell of bitcoin purchased for a few dollars and sold for fifty thousand will not be disuaded by a few percent higher interest rates. If regulators have consumer protection concerns about investments in cryptocurrency, they should use regulatory tools to combat them. If regulators see a “bubble” and want to discourage monetary flows into cryptocurrencies, they have tools to do that too. The idea that the macroeconomy should be managed with an eye to cryptocurrency prices is even more absurd than the suggestions of yesteryear to manage the macroeconomy with an eye to housing prices.\n\nLeaving the “bubble” argument aside, there is still the question of wage and employment growth. Rana doesn’t give much hint of her perspective of us in the article. She tells us that the Fed’s limited interest rate hikes in 2015 and 2016 didn’t have much of an effect on wage growth. But those hikes were small, quickly stopped and happened after wage growth among the lowest quarter of workers began to accelerate. She also tells us that lowering rates doesn’t increase employment much or accelerate low wage growth very much. Even if that were true, it doesn’t follow that raising interest rates couldn’t have a bigger negative impact. I have argued in the past that the effect of interest rate changes are asymmetric.\n\n\nHer perspective makes more sense when readers realize that she thinks recessions, unemployment and slowing wage growth for marginalized workers is inevitable. It just is a matter of happening now, or happening in bigger and worse ways in the future. She links to a remarkable article she wrote in 2019 bemoaning the lack of recession since the Great Financial Crisis. In it, she states that:\n\nAll this begs the question of whether longer really is better when it comes to business cycles. Recessions are a natural and normal part of capitalism, not something to be avoided at all costs. Indeed, the Deutsche Bank economists argue that productivity would be higher and American entrepreneurial zeal stronger if the US business cycle had not been artificially prolonged by monetary policy.\n\nIt’s important to remember that, as I pointed out in one of my very earliest pieces for Notes on the Crises in March of 2020, the economic recovery since the Great Financial Crisis had died of a pandemic, not of old age. A recession wasn’t otherwise inevitable. It is only made inevitable by policymakers who take a complacent view to recessions, encouraged by pundits like Foroohar. Later on last year I also criticized the fallacies baked into the Deutsche Bank view she recounts.\n\n\nWhatever the facts may be, Rana’s view is now clear. She doesn’t think macroeconomic policy can sustain recoveries which lead to tightening labor markets, so why bother trying? The attempts to try “just” cause bubbles which increase inequality and make things worse. It’s notable that she avoids talking about the fiscal policy interventions last year which sustained incomes for very many ordinary workers, actually leading to much more income protection for lower wage workers than the Great Financial Crisis. It is, of course, the amazing and unprecedented response of fiscal policy which has sustained overall income growth and made it possible for austerity-leaning pundits to make a case for contractionary policy at all.\n\n\nOf course, there is a grain of truth in the argument that there is some sort of connection between low rates and wealth inequality. Future income streams, whether potential or actual, are frequently turned into forms of property that can be bought and sold now. Rental housing is bought and sold today incorporating the value of rents that can be charged decades into the future. Bonds, stocks, real estate properties and other such assets will see their valuations rise when interest rates fall according to the rules of standard valuation methodologies.\n\n\nHowever, there is less here than meets the eye. For one thing, capital gains come from falling interest rates, not low interest rates. Sustaining the same interest rate stance doesn’t have the effect of increasing capital gains, and certainly not to the extent that actually lowering interest rates does. This sort of capital gains happened in the 1980s when rates were falling from 20+% to “merely” 7% or so. Holding interest rates at the same level shouldn’t be conflated with this interest rate effect. Further, from an inequality point of view, the high returns provided by such high interest rates is as relevant as these capital gains. It's not hard to get rich when you are earning your principal back in just a few years.\n\n\n\nBy definition, the total return from a bond is the interest received plus any possible capital gains from selling the bond. When interest rates fall, future bonds provide less interest at that rate level. They also provide less scope for capital gains than the “incumbent” bonds. Meanwhile, the current holders of those bonds won’t see any difference in return as a result of these paper capital gains unless they sell those bonds. The result of all this is that high bond returns are ultimately sourced to high interest rates, whether currently or significantly in the past. The decades long “bull market” in bonds is made up of already high returns from high interest rates getting “supercharged” by their dramatic decline  (bond investors and analysts distinguish between different types of capital gains to strategize the returns “bond funds” provide. That is beyond the scope of my analysis here, though this thread is a good starting point)\n\n\nThe point is that when commentators are quick to blame bond returns on historically low interest rates, they ignore the other side of the coin- high interest rates in the past. Why should we increase future bond returns (not to mention loan returns) by making it easier to charge higher interest rates in the future? Or set the stage for a future “bull bond market” where interest rates can again be lowered? A low and flat yield curve will decrease bond market returns over time, if that truly is our goal.\n\n\nBy this point a reader may be saying “okay, that may be true about bonds, but what about stocks and real estate?” This is an important question. It is also more complex. Bond returns (whether capital gains or interest) are mainly about interest rate valuations. These other assets experience returns that are, for the most part, unrelated to interest rate valuations. Interest rates can be at zero, but a stock can still experience big capital gains simply because the company grows substantially, paying more dividends and/or accumulating more assets (thus supporting stock price increases). In fact, this is one of the main reasons to invest in stocks in the first place and why the concept of an “expensive stock” is relative. A very expensive stock can still provide high returns if it will indeed keep on growing.\n\n\nThe flipside of these points is that if interest rate valuations are much less important to returns in these areas, they are much less relevant to the impact returns to these assets have on overall inequality. In that portion of returns for which interest rate valuations are relevant, the tradeoff between capital gains now and yield in the future remains just as relevant here as they do for bonds. More than anything, this viewpoint emphasizes how ephemeral interest rates are to wealth inequality as an ongoing and intergenerational process- which makes sense. Once stated, it becomes obvious that owning all the companies and all the real estate would generate most wealth inequality and most increases in measured wealth inequality.\n\nThis all leaves us with the idea that lowering interest rates today can raise measured inequality today through increasing the current value of future yields, but it is not an enduring effect and becomes swamped by lower yields over time. More than anything else, we’ve clarified that interest rate valuations are a sideshow to the story of U.S wealth inequality. Targeting the wealthy’s returns will require some combination of regulation, reallocating coordination rights, democratizing companies and heavy taxation. It shouldn’t shock readers that such a policy program is not espoused by monetary policy hawks who cry over interest rate driven inequality.\n\n\nThis logic appears even more broken when put in a comparative context. As economist JW Mason pointed out many years ago, the U.S. has more assets which see paper price increases because more of society’s wealth is converted into property which can be freely bought and sold. Countries like Germany have lower stock valuations because of worker representation and influence on companies and a higher proportion of renters. Those renters have strong legal protections for their tenancy which decreases measured real estate values. If we followed the logic that interest rate policy should be made with these valuation changes in mind, the very fact that the U.S. is a substantively more unequal society would push towards the U.S. raising interest rates to paper over that fact while countries like Germany could “afford” to have lower interest rates.\n\n\nThis doesn’t provide any coherent guide to policy. One final issue is important to talk about. Throughout the article, Foroohar implies that higher interest rates would lead less wealthy households to build wealth, closing wealth gaps while negative “real” interest rates increase wealth inequality through discouraging wealth building. This is false. The bottom 50% of households in wealth are net debtors and their net-worth is at 2% of overall net-worth, a post-GFC high. Higher interest rates will drain their disposable income, lessening any possibility to build wealth. After all, paying off debts is a form of wealth building as well.\n\n\nIn fact, as economists Sandy Darity and Darrick Hamilton constantly point out, saving doesn’t have much to do with wealth building at all. It is inherited wealth which drives household wealth inequality. This is obvious once we remember that all the companies in existence have associated owners or shareholders and the vast majority of urban and suburban real estate is already owned by households. How could wealth be anything other than made up of these intergenerational transfers? The children of Logan Roy in the HBO show Succession didn’t save their way to being heirs of an empire.\n\n\nFor all the attempts to dress themselves in the concerns of racial and social justice, these sorts of arguments appear stilted. Commentators like Foroohar are missing the spirit which drives concerns with inequality below the pundit class. No one cares much about some property claim somewhere going up in value in and of itself. What they care about is the power that that property can hold over them. They care about their inability to gain an income, live in good housing or improve their working conditions. They are concerned about the power a boss, landlord or creditor has over them.\n\n\nRaising interest rates to cause a recession will hurt very real people. It will give creditors greater power over ordinary households and it will threaten the wage growth that lower wage workers have been experiencing. None of the people hurt by these policies will take much comfort in a graph that shows some billionaires experienced some paper losses while still having the power and control they have over the companies they operate or society at large. Raising interest rates to reduce wealth inequality is the equalizer of knaves and fools.\n\n\n\n\nPrinter Friendly Version\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n","html":"<p><em>Miss the New Notes on the Crises podcast? </em><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/notes-on-the-crises-podcast-1-joe-weisenthal-on-supply-chains/\"><em>Check out episode one with Joe Weisenthal</em></a><em>.  I am also excited to announce today that I am doing <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal\">an end-of-year sale</a>.

One particularly confusing line points to “academic research” showing low interest rates cause asset bubbles but links to a theoretical paper on the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-secularly-stagnating-arguments-of-olivier-blanchard-and-larry-summers/\">natural rate of interest</a> and inequality which doesn’t discuss bubbles. This is the only real justification for the assertion in the article. Plenty of debt fueled bouts of asset price increases<a href=\"https://utpress.utexas.edu/books/blab2p?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> have continued amid</a> high interest rates and rising interest rates. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes from August 2004 to August 2006 did little to cool the U.S. housing market. That’s no surprise when banks were <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-there-really-a-looming-bank-collapse/\">systematically committing fraud</a> in order to gain double digit returns. How high does Foroohar want the U.S. to raise interest rates?<br></p><p>This question becomes particularly urgent since she implies that she wants the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in order to crash the cryptocurrency market:</p><blockquote>With stock prices still near record highs, and US home prices up nearly 20 per cent annually, it’s no wonder that small-time investors are desperate for their slice of the pie. Income growth won’t buy you a house. And yet, risk is greatest just when the punchbowl is about to be pulled. I worry about the rise of retail speculation on apps such as Robinhood. I also worry that investors with fewer liquid assets are those taking on some of the biggest risks. Consider a recent Harris poll showing that 15 per cent of Latino Americans and 25 per cent of African Americans say they’ve purchased non-fungible tokens, compared with just 8 per cent of white Americans.</blockquote><p>First, it must be emphasized that taking this Harris poll at face value strains credulity past its breaking point. There is simply no way that 1 in 4 Black people own an NFT and that the proportion of Black people who own an NFT is triple the proportion of white people who do. If you look at the actual poll it <a href=\"https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Harris-Poll_Speculative-Investing_Data-Tables_March-2021.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">helpfully informs closer readers</a> that: “[t]his online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. Figures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region and household income were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population.” In other words, there isn’t a margin for error- there’s a chasm of possible error. It is painfully obvious that crypto fans who responded to an online poll mentioning crypto and “non-response bias” from non-cryptocurrency holders blew up the results.<br></p><p>The misuse of this poll in this argument is however, in some sense, a distraction. The more fundamental problem here is the idea that raising interest rates to 4 or 5 percent will kill interest in cryptocurrencies, a space which has seen extreme levels of volatility and returns. Someone who hears tell of bitcoin purchased for a few dollars and sold for fifty thousand will not be disuaded by a few percent higher interest rates. If regulators have consumer protection concerns about investments in cryptocurrency, they should use regulatory tools to combat them. If regulators see a “bubble” and want to discourage monetary flows into cryptocurrencies, they have tools to do that too. The idea that the macroeconomy should be managed with an eye to cryptocurrency prices is even more absurd than the suggestions of yesteryear to manage the macroeconomy with an eye to housing prices.</p><p>Leaving the “bubble” argument aside, there is still the question of wage and employment growth. Rana doesn’t give much hint of her perspective of us in the article. She tells us that the Fed’s limited interest rate hikes in 2015 and 2016 didn’t have much of an effect on wage growth. But those hikes were small, quickly stopped and happened after wage growth among the lowest quarter of workers <a href=\"https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker?panel=1&ref=crisesnotes.com\">began to accelerate</a>. She also tells us that lowering rates doesn’t increase employment much or accelerate low wage growth very much. Even if that were true, it doesn’t follow that raising interest rates couldn’t have a bigger negative impact. I have argued in the past that the effect of interest rate <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/low-interest-rates-dont-drive-market/\">changes are asymmetric</a>.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/M8upszg8poDT49JMBG8q-G4pSm85GgCcEsDoiJ1TyMUNjysqL0p9A__oGwSN-A5ZcXAwcNvy_SiIwP85z80w5eYdBgGvefW9mprEyxpnI9hh8SwWL3aQ9HQF3G1_WhJdmWVyAeFJ\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Her perspective makes more sense when readers realize that she thinks recessions, unemployment and slowing wage growth for marginalized workers is inevitable. It just is a matter of happening now, or happening in bigger and worse ways in the future. She links to a remarkable article she wrote in 2019 bemoaning the lack of recession since the Great Financial Crisis. In it, she states that:</p><blockquote>All this begs the question of whether longer really is better when it comes to business cycles. Recessions are a natural and normal part of capitalism, not something to be avoided at all costs. Indeed, the Deutsche Bank economists argue that productivity would be higher and American entrepreneurial zeal stronger if the US business cycle had not been artificially prolonged by monetary policy.</blockquote><p>It’s important to remember that, as I <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/were-we-heading-to-a-recession-anyway/\">pointed out in one of my very earliest pieces</a> for <em>Notes on the Crises</em> in March of 2020, the economic recovery since the Great Financial Crisis had died of a pandemic, not of old age. A recession wasn’t otherwise inevitable. It is only made inevitable by policymakers who take a complacent view to recessions, encouraged by pundits like Foroohar. Later on last year <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/should-we-start-shooting-corporate/\">I also criticized the fallacies</a> baked into the Deutsche Bank view she recounts.<br></p><p>Whatever the facts may be, Rana’s view is now clear. She doesn’t think macroeconomic policy can sustain recoveries which lead to tightening labor markets, so why bother trying? The attempts to try “just” cause bubbles which increase inequality and make things worse. It’s <a href=\"https://jwmason.org/slackwire/earnings-shocks-and-stabilization-during-covid-19/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">notable that</a> she avoids talking about the fiscal policy interventions last year which sustained incomes for very many ordinary workers, actually leading to much more income protection for lower wage workers than the Great Financial Crisis. It is, of course, the amazing and unprecedented response of fiscal policy which has sustained overall income growth and made it possible for austerity-leaning pundits to make a case for contractionary policy at all.<br></p><p>Of course, there is a grain of truth in the argument that there is some sort of connection between low rates and wealth inequality. Future income streams, whether potential or actual, are frequently turned into forms of property that can be bought and sold now. Rental housing is bought and sold today incorporating the value of rents that can be charged decades into the future. Bonds, stocks, real estate properties and other such assets will see their valuations rise when interest rates fall according to the rules of standard valuation methodologies. <br></p><p>However, there is less here than meets the eye. For one thing, capital gains come from <em>falling</em> interest rates, not <em>low</em> interest rates. Sustaining the same interest rate stance doesn’t have the effect of increasing capital gains, and certainly not to the extent that actually lowering interest rates does. This sort of capital gains happened in the 1980s when rates were falling from 20+% to “merely” 7% or so. Holding interest rates at the same level shouldn’t be conflated with this interest rate effect. Further, from an inequality point of view, the high returns provided by such high interest rates is as relevant as these capital gains. It's not hard to get rich when you are earning your principal back in just a few years.<br><br></p><p>By definition, the total return from a bond is the interest received plus any possible capital gains from selling the bond. When interest rates fall, future bonds provide less interest at that rate level. They also provide less scope for capital gains than the “incumbent” bonds. Meanwhile, the current holders of those bonds won’t see any difference in return as a result of these paper capital gains unless they sell those bonds. The result of all this is that high bond returns are ultimately sourced to high interest rates, whether currently or significantly in the past. The decades long “bull market” in bonds is made up of already high returns from high interest rates getting “supercharged” by their dramatic decline  (bond investors and analysts distinguish between different types of capital gains to strategize the returns “bond funds” provide. That is beyond the scope of my analysis here, though this thread is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/choffstein/status/1445038271579443201?ref=crisesnotes.com\">good starting point</a>)<br></p><p>The point is that when commentators are quick to blame bond returns on historically low interest rates, they ignore the other side of the coin- high interest rates in the past. Why should we increase future bond returns (not to mention loan returns) by making it easier to charge higher interest rates in the future? Or set the stage for a future “bull bond market” where interest rates can again be lowered? A low and flat yield curve will decrease bond market returns over time, if that truly is our goal.<br></p><p>By this point a reader may be saying “okay, that may be true about bonds, but what about stocks and real estate?” This is an important question. It is also more complex. Bond returns (whether capital gains or interest) are mainly <em>about</em> interest rate valuations. These other assets experience returns that are, for the most part, unrelated to interest rate valuations. Interest rates can be at zero, but a stock can still experience big capital gains simply because the company grows substantially, paying more dividends and/or accumulating more assets (thus supporting stock price increases). In fact, this is one of the main reasons to invest in stocks in the first place and why the concept of an “expensive stock” is relative. A very expensive stock can still provide high returns if it will indeed keep on growing.<br></p><p>The flipside of these points is that if interest rate valuations are much less important to returns in these areas, they are much less relevant to the impact returns to these assets have on overall inequality. In that portion of returns for which interest rate valuations are relevant, the tradeoff between capital gains now and yield in the future remains just as relevant here as they do for bonds. More than anything, this viewpoint emphasizes how ephemeral interest rates are to wealth inequality as an ongoing and intergenerational process- which makes sense. Once stated, it becomes obvious that owning all the companies and all the real estate would generate most wealth inequality and most increases in measured wealth inequality.<br><br>This all leaves us with the idea that lowering interest rates today can raise measured inequality today through increasing the current value of future yields, but it is not an enduring effect and becomes swamped by lower yields over time. More than anything else, we’ve clarified that interest rate valuations are a sideshow to the story of U.S wealth inequality. Targeting the wealthy’s returns will require some combination of regulation, reallocating coordination rights, democratizing companies and heavy taxation. It shouldn’t shock readers that such a policy program is not espoused by monetary policy hawks who cry over interest rate driven inequality.<br></p><p>This logic appears even more broken when put in a comparative context. As <a href=\"https://jwmason.org/slackwire/wealth-distribution-and-puzzle-of/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">economist JW Mason</a> pointed out many years ago, the U.S. has more assets which see paper price increases because more of society’s wealth is converted into property which can be freely bought and sold. Countries like Germany have lower stock valuations because of worker representation and influence on companies and a higher proportion of renters. Those renters have strong legal protections for their tenancy which decreases measured real estate values. If we followed the logic that interest rate policy should be made with these valuation changes in mind, the very fact that the U.S. is a substantively more unequal society would push towards the U.S. raising interest rates to paper over that fact while countries like Germany could “afford” to have lower interest rates.<br></p><p>This doesn’t provide any coherent guide to policy. One final issue is important to talk about. Throughout the article, Foroohar implies that higher interest rates would lead less wealthy households to build wealth, closing wealth gaps while negative “real” interest rates increase wealth inequality through discouraging wealth building. This is false. The bottom 50% of households in wealth are net debtors and their net-worth is a<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-09/bottom-half-of-u-s-households-post-fastest-gain-in-wealth?ref=crisesnotes.com\">t 2% of overall net-worth</a>, a post-GFC high. Higher interest rates will drain their disposable income, lessening any possibility to build wealth. After all, paying off debts is a form of wealth building as well.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Jc33TcU61WzO38SPfH6DkbUGMTkJY4Jcz0QpnTiRJlHFdFUNxxxfKVl1wnu4f7-SQylzsp2Usmfe1viFUbRsmzFTL1Jp8bnCP4e73pjLRsNrOqsJn54xJX6wVbwmnE1S9luseTNA\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>In fact, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1007/s12114-010-9063-1?ref=crisesnotes.com\">as economists Sandy Darity and Darrick Hamilton constantly point out</a>, saving doesn’t have much to do with wealth building at all. It is inherited wealth which drives household wealth inequality. This is obvious once we remember that all the companies in existence have associated owners or shareholders and the vast majority of urban and suburban real estate is already owned by households. How could wealth be anything other than made up of these intergenerational transfers? The children of Logan Roy in the HBO show Succession didn’t save their way to being heirs of an empire.<br></p><p>For all the attempts to dress themselves in the concerns of racial and social justice, these sorts of arguments appear stilted. Commentators like Foroohar are missing the spirit which drives concerns with inequality below the pundit class. No one cares much about some property claim somewhere going up in value in and of itself. What they care about is the power that that property can hold over them. They care about their inability to gain an income, live in good housing or improve their working conditions. They are concerned about the power a boss, landlord or creditor has over them. <br></p><p>Raising interest rates to cause a recession will hurt very real people. It will give creditors greater power over ordinary households and it will threaten the wage growth that lower wage workers have been experiencing. None of the people hurt by these policies will take much comfort in a graph that shows some billionaires experienced some paper losses while still having the power and control they have over the companies they operate or society at large. Raising interest rates to reduce wealth inequality is the equalizer of knaves and fools.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><html> <center> \n    <br>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g6HlFnnYkhLgYY5XZMHD9Bvv_yXbR-RT/view?usp=sharing&ref=crisesnotes.com\"   <button> Printer Friendly Version </button> </a> </br>  </center> \n</html><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><html> <center> \n    <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal\"   <button> Subscribe </button> </a> </br>  </center> \n</html><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/rana-foroohars-strange-case-for-raising-interest-rates-does-stringent-monetary-policy-really-produce-equality/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"2b778c38-50d5-4809-acf0-8420db2c5c86","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"619ef756085a6e003ba2cedf","reading_time":10}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"November 3","id":"Ghost__Post__61824d70d1db11003b429439","title":"Notes on the Crises Podcast #1: Joe Weisenthal on Supply Chains","slug":"notes-on-the-crises-podcast-1-joe-weisenthal-on-supply-chains","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2021/11/NOTC-podcast-art-1.1-1.jpg","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#c8c8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/36e151614e676882a5f2f7b890e0c9f9/cabd1/NOTC-podcast-art-1.1-1.jpg","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/36e151614e676882a5f2f7b890e0c9f9/19e71/NOTC-podcast-art-1.1-1.jpg 128w,\n/migrantinsider/static/36e151614e676882a5f2f7b890e0c9f9/68974/NOTC-podcast-art-1.1-1.jpg 256w,\n/migrantinsider/static/36e151614e676882a5f2f7b890e0c9f9/cabd1/NOTC-podcast-art-1.1-1.jpg 511w","sizes":"(min-width: 511px) 511px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/36e151614e676882a5f2f7b890e0c9f9/6766a/NOTC-podcast-art-1.1-1.webp 128w,\n/migrantinsider/static/36e151614e676882a5f2f7b890e0c9f9/22bfc/NOTC-podcast-art-1.1-1.webp 256w,\n/migrantinsider/static/36e151614e676882a5f2f7b890e0c9f9/9f973/NOTC-podcast-art-1.1-1.webp 511w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 511px) 511px, 100vw"}]},"width":511,"height":511}}},"excerpt":"Notes on the Crises has a new monthly podcast","custom_excerpt":"Notes on the Crises has a new monthly podcast","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"03 November, 2021","published_at_pretty":"03 November, 2021","updated_at_pretty":"03 November, 2021","created_at":"2021-11-03T04:50:56.000-04:00","published_at":"2021-11-03T08:45:00.000-04:00","updated_at":"2021-11-03T09:56:25.000-04:00","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Notes on the Crises","slug":"crisesnotes","bio":null,"profile_image":null,"twitter":null,"facebook":null,"website":null}],"primary_author":{"name":"Notes on the Crises","slug":"crisesnotes","bio":null,"profile_image":null,"twitter":null,"facebook":null,"website":null},"primary_tag":{"name":"Fiscal Policy","slug":"fiscal-policy","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},"tags":[{"name":"Fiscal Policy","slug":"fiscal-policy","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},null],"plaintext":" \nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal] \nDear readers, I have exciting news!

But\ninstead, we have hit very rough terrain. President Biden’s whittled down\ninfrastructure spending plans are in critical danger\n[https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-bills-b9fb060c728da28709fc9effaecb0b9a] \n( weary readers may recall these plans started life as a much more expansive\napproach to“building back better” and what “infrastructure” meant).  As time has\ndraged on, the fights over the Biden administration’s spending agenda have\ncrashed head first into our recurring cycle of debt ceiling crises.\n\nTo recap, for obscure reasons [https://rohangrey.net/files/coinage.pdf] in\nfiscal history, congress has decided to pass appropriations bills which\nauthorized and required spending, while imposing arbitrary limitations on how\nmuch debt the treasury can incur in meeting the obligations which congress has\nimposed on the Treasury. Congress then raises this debt ceiling periodically (or\nsuspends it altogether…). But this is not permitted before making raising it a\nplace for partisan political grandstanding. This spectacle has gotten more\nserious as partisanship sharpened, and the Republican party became more\nsingle-minded in its policy-invariant opposition to Democratic presidents in the\n1990s.\n\n\nThis is the most serious debt ceiling crisis yet — today there is not even a\npretense of negotiations between the parties. Worse, the Democratic party\ncontrols the senate by the thinnest of margins, giving right wing Democrats\nenormous leverage. Many in Washington see what’s at stake as nothing less than\nthe ability of those in the majority to govern and pass the agenda they were\nelected to pass — a reasonable perspective, to my mind.\n\nFor my purposes, what is sufficient is that either some legal or financial\ntechnicality will bypass the obstructions, or the Biden administration's\nspending agenda will need curtailing — or even to be abandoned altogether. I\nthink that is a high cost to bear, especially since there are alternatives. I’ll\nleave aside the complicated legislative maneuvers happening now since others are\ncovering these in great detail. As others are focusing on the legal\ntechnicalities, I will focus on my specialty: the financial technicalities.\n\n\nAvoiding the Ceiling Altogether\n\nBefore we discuss a certain coin of … ample denomination, it’s worth taking a\nstep back to think of other available options. There are more conventional\nmeasures that could have been done to avoid, or at least delay, this\neventuality. But how seriously were these being considered?\n\n\nOne option is to simply keep the balance in the Treasury General Account\n(essentially the U.S. Treasury’s “checking” account) at the Federal Reserve very\nhigh. In thinking about this, I was very surprised to find that as soon as Janet\nYellen became Treasury Secretary, the TGA began precipitously dropping\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=H6Yh]. This is partially understandable:\nfunds from various recently passed legislations presumably began to be dispersed\nin large quantities. Nonetheless, this could always be offset by more treasury\nauctions.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, the downside to sustaining the Treasury’s general account at such\nhigh levels would normally be that you reach the debt ceiling limit that much\nsooner. However, this is not the problem it appears at first sight because the\ndebt ceiling no longer works this way. In the last few rounds of debt ceiling\nfights, congress abandoned simply raising the debt ceiling limit. \n\n\nInstead, they “suspended” the debt ceiling\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-01/u-s-debt-ceiling-suspension-ends-congress-unclear-on-next-step]\n. That means that if no solution was reached by the time of the suspension’s\nexpiration, the new debt ceiling simply became however many treasury securities\nwere in the hands of  “the public”. (The debt ceiling resumed at the end of July\n2021, which is why we’re talking about all this now.) \n\n\nThe “extraordinary measures” the Treasury uses to avoid missing payments\n(whether they be interest payments or social security payments) has carried it\nthis far. But those stopgaps are expected to run out sometime in the next month\nor so.\n\n\nThus, the new structure of temporarily dealing with the debt ceiling obstacle\nhas fundamentally changed how the U.S. Treasury can deal with the situation.\nSince the debt ceiling, if it should return, will just apply to whatever\ntreasuries are outstanding, the Treasury department could have issued 10\ntrillion dollars worth of securities. As we’ve talked about at great length\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/we-should-authorize-the-federal-reserve/], the\nFederal Reserve ensures that Treasury security issuance doesn’t interfere with\nits monetary policy objectives. That means there are no concerns over the\nliquidity of these treasuries, or the overall level of interest rates. \n\n\nOf course, on a day to day level there would have to be a significantly\nincreased level of coordination between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve,\nbut this would be a difference of degree and not of kind.\n\n\nI realized as I wrote this piece that this option created by the new legal\nstructure of the debt ceiling has never been properly articulated publicly (at\nleast as far as I’m aware). That is likely a big reason why the general account\nwasn’t sustained at high levels — or even greatly increased from the “lameduck”\nTrump era. Still, I do find myself somewhat disappointed that Secretary Yellen\ndidn’t do more to make the resumption of the debt ceiling a politically less\npainful experience. I can’t help but wonder if her historical deficit\nhawkishness prevented her considering an option that would have technically\nmeant more debt outstanding sooner.\n\n\nI’ve discussed this option informally with a number of people in economic policy\ncircles over the last couple of years.  I have taken to calling it the “Poor\nman’s Trillion Dollar Platinum Coin”.  While this option is an interesting\nconceptual exercise, it is a moot point now. The debt ceiling has resumed. The\nplatinum coin however, is a live option. \n\n\nWhich brings us to our big boy, the Platinum Coin.\n\n\nYes, #MintTheCoin\n\n\nCould a trillion dollar platinum coin solve our cycle of constitutional crisis\nfrom causing intractable financial chaos? Let’s recap!\n\n\nI’ve discussed this intriguing technicality in U.S. coinage law at the very\nbeginning [https://www.crisesnotes.com/all-your-questions-about-the-trillion/] \nof Notes on the Crises. At the time, it served as a kind of “fiscal rhetoric”. A\nrhetorical tool clear to the public that responding to the Coronavirus\nDepression was financially feasible.\n\nHowever, the coin began life as a discovery by an enterprising independent\nlawyer named Carlos Mucha [https://twitter.com/mucha_carlos], who was\nresearching ways to get around Obama’s debt ceiling crisis. Thus, we have swung\nback around to the “classical” platinum coin debates (and yes, they’ve gone on\nlong enough to have “classical” debates!). It is important to emphasize in the\ncontext of these “classical” debates that this is a currently available\nfinancing instrument which can be used at any time.\n\n\nThe debt ceiling only caps how much debt can be outstanding and not all\nliabilities count for that purpose. An obvious example of a liability that\ndoesn’t count would be the Treasury’s obligation to pay social security payments\nto retirees. Even some currently circulating instruments don’t count under the\ndebt ceiling. For example, the Treasury has the ability to issue its own paper\nmoney (called “Treasury Notes”) which does not count under the debt ceiling. \n\nHowever, paper issuance has its own particular cap of 300 million — an\nantiquated limit which dates from the 19th century! Coin issuance has no such\ncap. However, coins are usually statutorily limited in what denomination they\ncan be issued. It would be technically unfeasible (to say the least!) to issue\ndollar coins in sufficient quantities to cover modern deficit spending.\n\n\nThere is however, one exception. Section 5112(k)\n[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5112] of the U.S. Code authorizes\nthe mint and issuance of:\n\n...platinum bullion coins and proof platinum coins in accordance with such\nspecifications, designs, varieties, quantities, denominations, and inscriptions\nas the Secretary, in the Secretary’s discretion, may prescribe from time to time\n[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5112]\n\n\nIt may seem absurd when you first think of it — but according to this provision\nthe U.S. mint can legally mint platinum coins in denominations of the trillions,\nor more. So, why not?\n\n\nMy colleague Rohan Grey has written the definitive law review article\n[https://rohangrey.net/files/coinage.pdf] on its legality and implications.\nGrey’s piece features an extensive response to all the currently made\nobjections, and likely consequences for the debt ceiling.\n\n\nMoreover, the Treasury Secretary has not only the option, but the constitutional\nobligation to use this coinage power. Coinage must be deployed if it stands as\nthe only option available to her for avoiding default — and so it seems to be! \n\n\nThis constitutional obligation is one reason why it is very concerning that the\nBiden administration has publicly declared that this option is not on the table.\nThe other reason it is concerning is that it means they are willingly ceding\nleverage to Republicans. What will they give up in order to avoid using the coin\noption? \n\n\nDemocrats very understandably want to generate a political narrative around\nRepublican intransgenience — and in fairness, there is a lot of intransgenience\nto point to. [https://newrepublic.com/article/163534/case-partisanship] However,\nit is also intransgent to ignore and leave aside these alternative solutions in\nfavor of a political showdown. I also think Democrats overestimate the political\nbenefit they get from highlighting how difficult republicans are making\nlegislating. Potential voters are just as likely to drop out and feel voting is\npointless as they are to feel extra motivated to vote and oppose Republicans. \nSpending, however, can motivate people. \nAnd the best hope for Democrats passing a big spending bill is for accounting\ngimmicks to be dealt with by accounting gimmicks, rather than lowered\nexpectations. The debt ceiling is an accounting problem, calling out for an\naccounting solution.\n\nThat’s a lot of words to say something simple: Mint the damn coin! And then\nlet’s refocus on the real crises.\n\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal] \n\nPrinter Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/15T2_2IT35EYc6b74aInl_a7vp84EqqVP/view?usp=sharing]","html":"<p>After the Georgia runoff elections many had high hopes for fiscal policy.

As others are focusing on the legal technicalities, I will focus on my specialty: the financial technicalities.<br></p><p><strong>Avoiding the Ceiling Altogether</strong></p><p>Before we discuss a certain coin of … ample denomination, it’s worth taking a step back to think of other available options. There are more conventional measures that could have been done to avoid, or at least delay, this eventuality. But how seriously were these being considered?<br></p><p>One option is to simply keep the balance in the Treasury General Account (essentially the U.S. Treasury’s “checking” account) at the Federal Reserve very high. In thinking about this, I was very surprised to find that as soon as Janet Yellen became Treasury Secretary, the TGA <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=H6Yh&ref=crisesnotes.com\">began precipitously dropping</a>. This is partially understandable: funds from various recently passed legislations presumably began to be dispersed in large quantities. Nonetheless, this could always be offset by more treasury auctions.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lSDl8FGIYN23McdGVonADoKeIgGT804SyLZjOTqiGL4-pPBZMyUUOE8bUCtzIetcQClM5lcHhORNOC4-3NLlGKHpalpKSHhNslG1mya_AcNHY68jiDN1n8FqE0HLnG2B9dTQ1ITD=s0\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><br></p><p>Of course, the downside to sustaining the Treasury’s general account at such high levels would normally be that you <strong>reach the debt ceiling limit that much sooner.</strong> However, this is not the problem it appears at first sight because the debt ceiling no longer works this way. In the last few rounds of debt ceiling fights, congress abandoned simply raising the debt ceiling limit. <br></p><p>Instead, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-01/u-s-debt-ceiling-suspension-ends-congress-unclear-on-next-step?ref=crisesnotes.com\">they “suspended” the debt ceiling</a>. That means that if no solution was reached by the time of the suspension’s expiration, the new debt ceiling simply became however many treasury securities were in the hands of  “the public”. (The debt ceiling r<strong>esumed at the end of July 2021, </strong>which is why we’re talking about all this now.) <br></p><p>The “extraordinary measures” the Treasury uses to avoid missing payments (whether they be interest payments or social security payments) has carried it this far. But those stopgaps <strong>are expected to run out sometime in the next month or so.</strong><br></p><p>Thus, the new structure of temporarily dealing with the debt ceiling obstacle has fundamentally changed how the U.S. Treasury can deal with the situation. Since the debt ceiling, if it should return, will just apply to whatever treasuries are outstanding, the Treasury department could have issued 10 trillion dollars worth of securities. As <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/we-should-authorize-the-federal-reserve/\">we’ve talked about at great length</a>, the Federal Reserve ensures that Treasury security issuance doesn’t interfere with its monetary policy objectives. That means there are no concerns over the liquidity of these treasuries, or the overall level of interest rates. <br></p><p>Of course, on a day to day level there would have to be a significantly increased level of coordination between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, but this would be <strong>a difference of degree and not of kind.</strong><br></p><p>I realized as I wrote this piece that this option created by the new legal structure of the debt ceiling has never been properly articulated publicly (at least as far as I’m aware). That is likely a big reason why the general account wasn’t sustained at high levels — or even greatly increased from the “lameduck” Trump era. Still, I do find myself somewhat disappointed that Secretary Yellen didn’t do more to make the resumption of the debt ceiling a politically less painful experience. I can’t help but wonder if her historical deficit hawkishness prevented her considering an option that would have technically meant more debt outstanding sooner.<br></p><p>I’ve discussed this option informally with a number of people in economic policy circles over the last couple of years.  I have taken to calling it the “Poor man’s Trillion Dollar Platinum Coin”.  While this option is an interesting conceptual exercise, it is a moot point now. The debt ceiling has resumed. <strong>The platinum coin however, is a live option. </strong><br></p><p>Which brings us to our big boy, the Platinum Coin.<br></p><p><strong>Yes, #MintTheCoin</strong><br></p><p>Could a trillion dollar platinum coin solve our cycle of constitutional crisis from causing intractable financial chaos? Let’s recap!<br></p><p>I’ve discussed this intriguing technicality in U.S. coinage law <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/all-your-questions-about-the-trillion/\">at the very beginning</a> of <em>Notes on the Crises. </em>At the time, it served as a kind of “fiscal rhetoric”. A rhetorical tool clear to the public that responding to the Coronavirus Depression was financially feasible.<br><br>However, the coin began life as a discovery by an enterprising independent lawyer named <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mucha_carlos?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Carlos Mucha</a>, who was researching ways to get around Obama’s debt ceiling crisis. Thus, we have swung back around to the “classical” platinum coin debates (and yes, they’ve gone on long enough to have “classical” debates!). It is important to emphasize in the context of these “classical” debates that this is a currently available financing instrument which can be used at any time.<br></p><p>The debt ceiling only caps how much debt can be outstanding and not all liabilities count for that purpose. An obvious example of a liability that doesn’t count would be the Treasury’s obligation to pay social security payments to retirees. Even some currently circulating instruments don’t count under the debt ceiling. For example, the Treasury has the ability to issue its own paper money (called “Treasury Notes”) <strong>which does not count under the debt ceiling.</strong> <br><br>However, paper issuance has its own <strong>particular cap of 300 million — an antiquated limit</strong> which dates from the 19th century! Coin issuance has <strong>no such cap.</strong> However, coins are usually statutorily limited in what denomination they can be issued. It would be technically unfeasible (to say the least!) to issue dollar coins in sufficient quantities to cover modern deficit spending.<br></p><p>There is however,<strong> one exception.</strong><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5112?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> Section 5112(k)</a> of the U.S. Code authorizes the mint and issuance of:</p><p>...<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5112?ref=crisesnotes.com\">platinum bullion coins and proof platinum coins in accordance with such specifications, designs, varieties, quantities, denominations, and inscriptions as the Secretary, in the Secretary’s discretion, may prescribe from time to time</a><br></p><p>It may seem absurd when you first think of it — but according to this provision the U.S. mint can<strong> legally mint platinum coins in denominations of the trillions, or more.</strong> So, why not?<br></p><p>My colleague Rohan Grey has written the<a href=\"https://rohangrey.net/files/coinage.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> definitive law review article</a> on its legality and implications. Grey’s piece features an extensive response to all the currently made objections, and likely consequences for the debt ceiling.<br></p><p>Moreover, the Treasury Secretary has not only the option, but the <em>constitutional obligation </em>to use this coinage power. Coinage must be deployed if it stands as the only option available to her for avoiding default — and so it seems to be! <br></p><p>This constitutional obligation is one reason why it is very concerning that the Biden administration has publicly declared that this option is not on the table. The other reason it is concerning is that it means they are willingly ceding leverage to Republicans. What will they give up in order to avoid using the coin option? <br></p><p>Democrats very understandably want to generate a political narrative around Republican intransgenience — and in fairness, there is a<a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/163534/case-partisanship?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> lot of intransgenience to point to.</a> However, it is also intransgent to ignore and leave aside these alternative solutions in favor of a political showdown. I also think Democrats <strong>overestimate the political benefit</strong> they get from highlighting how difficult republicans are making legislating. Potential voters are <strong>just as likely to drop out and feel voting is pointless </strong>as they are to feel extra motivated to vote and oppose Republicans. <strong>Spending, however, can motivate people.</strong> <br>And the best hope for Democrats passing a big spending bill is for <strong>accounting gimmicks to be dealt with by accounting gimmicks, rather than lowered expectations. </strong>The debt ceiling is an accounting problem, calling out for an accounting solution.<br><br>That’s a lot of words to say something simple: <strong>Mint the damn coin!</strong> And then let’s<strong> refocus on the </strong><em><strong>real</strong></em><strong> crises.</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><html> <center> \n    <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal\"   <button> Subscribe </button> </a> </br>  </center> \n</html><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><html> <center> \n    <br>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/15T2_2IT35EYc6b74aInl_a7vp84EqqVP/view?usp=sharing&ref=crisesnotes.com\"   <button> Printer Friendly Version </button> </a> </br>  </center> \n</html><!--kg-card-end: html-->","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/yet-another-debt-ceiling-crisis-or-how-joe-biden-should-learn-to-stop-worrying-and-mintthecoin/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"807b068d-309b-4fd9-bdd0-b4d25930cae8","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"6151ebd90cfeed004ae5fef5","reading_time":6}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"August 4","id":"Ghost__Post__610ae4ac628114003baa6be8","title":"ID.ME Says There Has Been Massive Unemployment Benefits Fraud.

The Covid-19 pandemic had forced a near-total shutdown of the state's\neconomy and Thompson-Herfurth, a part-time delivery driver for Uber, DoorDash,\nand GrubHub, couldn't work.\n\nLuckily, unemployment benefit expansion meant she could get insurance payments.\nHowever, Maryland is one of four states in the nation—like Nevada—that will not\ndo direct deposit for unemployment benefits. That meant that Thompson-Herfurth\nalso had to go through a needlessly complicated verification process, in order\nto get her benefits.\n\n\"I applied for it and initially was approved,\" Thompson-Herfurth told me.\n\"Everything went through... I could see how much I was getting paid each week\nand it was supposedly going to a debit card, which I could not access because I\ndidn't have the debit card yet.\"\n\nThe card was held up because ID.me wasn't able to verify Thompson-Herfurth's\nidentity—\"they had me living in Texas with a totally different Social Security\nnumber with my name,\" she said—and the process of getting the company to\nacknowledge she was who she said she was took four months. Thompson-Herfurth\ndescribed sending hundreds of emails, making hundreds of phone calls, and using\nevery resource at her disposal to try to get the company to verify her identity.\n\nAll that stress took a toll.\n\n\"I had to go to the doctor, I had to get put on antidepressants, anti-anxiety\npills because my anxiety was through the roof,\"she said. \"My hair was falling\nout. I was physically getting ill from the situation.\"\n\nThompson-Herfurth isn't the only person to report infuriating delays from\nID.me's processes. And as the company expands to more states and picks up new\nprivate contracts, it's worth looking at the disconnect between what they claim\nthey can do and the reality of ID.me's services for the public.\n\nMarshall Steinbaum, a professor of economics at the University of Utah, told me\nthat he sees the use of ID.me in the unemployment insurance process as part of a\ndeeper rot at the heart of American institutions.\n\n\"The idea that benefits fraud is pervasive presupposes that beneficiaries are\nmorally culpable even if they haven't committed fraud (but they probably have),\nwhich is a retrograde and inegalitarian ideology,\" Steinbaum said.\n\nA Controversial Processing System for the Unemployed\n\nFounded by former Army Ranger Blake Hall in 2010, ID.me uses proprietary\nsoftware to verify identities for a number of purposes, including, increasingly,\ndispensation of unemployment benefits. The company exploded over the past year\nas states turned to private sector solutions for identity verification to match\nan unprecedented surge in unemployment insurance applications at the height of\nthe Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNow valued at $1.5 billion, ID.me raised $100 million in capital in March. The\ncompany described its success in a contemporaneous press release:\n\nToday, ID.me has 39 million members with more than 70,000 new users signing-up\nevery day to its secure digital identity network. Major federal agencies, 22\nstates, and over 400 leading brands accept ID.me's login to streamline customer\nauthentication. ID.me's service is free to consumers while business customers\npay ID.me for trust and to streamline workflows.\n\nYet despite the increase in valuation, the company's effectiveness is a matter\nof some debate. Critics say that ID.me's processes are overly lengthy,\nunnecessarily confusing. This point of view was widespread among the people I\ntalked to who actually had to personally deal with the system. This dysfunction\nhad high stakes: it could result in months-long delays for already urgently\nneeded payments. These logistical delays have real-world effects, from economic\nhardship to anxiety-induced stress and illnesses.\n\nAxios reporter Felix Salmon, pointing to the company's numbers on unemployment\ninsurance fraud, claimed that drops in successful applicants that occur after\nthe company takes the reins is evidence that the firm's system is working.\n\nBut the company's seen bad press around the efficacy of its signature product.\nLong wait times and frustrating processes have been a marker for ID.me as the\ncompany has taken charge of identity verification in unemployment insurance\nsystems around the country. In Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, landscaper Mark\nSamuel told local affiliate Fox 43\n[https://www.fox43.com/article/news/local/cumberland-county-man-says-he-cannot-get-someone-to-verify-his-identity-for-unemployment-benefits/521-fd9f1578-2623-42c0-a1f8-54b68718fde6] \non April 29 that he had been waiting 45 days to talk to someone in the company's\nvideo chat.\n\n\"I'm extremely frustrated,\" Samuel said, \"and if I didn't have a full freezer,\nand we depended on this, and my wife got sick, and we didn't own a business,\nwe'd be in pretty bad shape, and I'm sure there are others in bad shape.\"\n\nSalmon didn't contest that there were problems in how the company does its work:\n\n\"There are, I'm sure, absolutely thousands of individuals who got caught up in\nthis who haven't been able to prove their identity, who are having a horrible\ntime dealing with it,\" he told me. \"I am not an ID.me fanboy in any way.\"\n\nDelays for the Desperate\n\nWait times at the video call center where \"Dean,\" a video support team member at\nthe company, works were \"days long\" at points over the winter in December and\nJanuary, he told me. It's hard to see how people survived, he said, given the\nway the system treated applicants—with or without ID.me verification delays.\n\n\"I talk to roughly 45 people in an 8 hour shift, and a common statement is, 'all\nthis has taken me a month, or two months, or two weeks, or three,'\" Dean said.\n\"There's obviously something going on that the system is not able to handle\nthese things quickly.\"\n\nEconomist Steinbaum pointed to the company's pervasive issues as evidence of a\ncareless approach to lifesaving benefits at the hands of a company using a\nmoment of crisis to make a quick buck.\n\n\"The tech is bad, the data can be hacked, vulnerable people are assumed not to\nhave ownership of their own data if they're applying for benefits anyway,\" he\nsaid. \"It's all just a gross concoction.\"\n\nIn comment, ID.me strenuously denied its wait times were in the days or\nweeks.CEO Hall  told me that ID.me doesn't usually have wait times exceeding 30\nminutes at the most, at least now.\n\n\"Wait times for Trusted Referee sessions have been consistently under 30 minutes\nfor the past month and are currently in the single digits,\" he said.\n\nAs far as the higher wait times reported by people frustrated with the service,\nHall put the onus for those delays on states for sending the company the\nentirety of their backlog at once.\n\n\"We had multiple states send us months, and even a full years worth, of\nclaimants to us for verification in several weeks due to the overwhelming fraud\nthat preceded our introduction in that state. The states decided they would\nrather have wait times go up for a short period of time than to pay fraudulent\nclaims out to organized crime rings. Of course, when states spiked demand for\nour services, wait times went up for several weeks, but that was not a function\nof ID.me’s capacity but rather a state choice to send their entire applicant\npool to us for processing at once. ,\" Hall said.\n\nEven if one accepts that as true, it's an irrelevant distinction to those\nwaiting on the company for identity verification, and puts the lie to Hall's\nclaim that \"no one is waiting days or weeks to verify — or even close to that.\"\nAfter all, not everyone has the time to wait hours on end to get through to\nsomeone on the other end of a video chat, assuming that their internet doesn't\ncut out and bump them back out of line. While ID.me's failures to provide\nverification in a timely manner has caused countless problems for users, the\nreal issue with unemployment insurance is a deeper, systemic one,\nThompson-Herfurth told me. A government-wide failure at the state and federal\nlevel to provide benefits to those who lost their jobs during an unprecedented\neconomic crisis is at the root of the problem.\n\n\"I think the government needs to step up and provide a better paying system for\njobs,\" said Thompson-Herfurth.\n\nOrganizing to Secure Support for the Unemployed\n\nDustin Branch, a national digital and distributed organizer with Unemployed\nWorkers United, currently located in Orlando, Florida, filed for unemployment\nlast year and entered the labyrinthine world of identity verification that ID.me\nruns as part of its contracts with state governments. Branch, who worked for the\nBernie Sanders campaign in Nevada in 2020, found himself out of work with the\npandemic bearing down after the campaign shut down.\n\nLike Maryland, Nevada's unemployment system requires people to get a Bank of\nAmerica prepaid card for their funds, which are deposited into the account. You\ncan do a check, Branch told me, but that takes months. It took him nearly a year\nto get through Nevada's unemployment insurance system and then the bank's\nidentity verification system, run by ID.me, held up his payments.\n\n\"It wasn't until March 15th of 2021 that I finally got my unemployment\nbenefits,\" Branch said. \"So almost a full year from when I first applied—and the\nsame day that I got notification that this deposit had been made, Bank of\nAmerica blocked my card for identity verification. So there is no way for me to\ntransfer it out.\"\n\nHe called the unemployment insurance system in Nevada to make sure the correct\ndocuments were in place, and the state agency assured him they were. But that\ndidn't matter, ID.me didn't have his identity verified. He would eventually, in\nMay—two months later—get the whole thing sorted out.\n\nBranch, who called the verification process \"completely absurd,\" told me that\nwhile ID.me had his information from the moment he applied last year, the holds\nwere put on anyway, evidence of the outdated system in place.\n\n\"Thousands of people have been denied and had their claims and their benefits\nput on hold because of this,\" Branch said.\n\nA California worker who dealt with ID.me in that state— who I’ll refer to as\nStephen—was one of those people. He told me that fighting to verify his identity\nwith the company was a nightmare. As well as being slow, the process almost\nresulted in him having to pay back four months of unemployment insurance\nbenefits.\n\n\"I’d only been back working for a couple of months at that point, after several\nmonths without any income,\" Stephen said. \"The idea of my wages being possibly\ngarnished and owing back all that expanded UI was extremely stressful.\"\n\nThe process Stephen had to go through to verify his identity, he told me, was \n\"needlessly stressful and a huge time suck.\"\n\nUnemployed Workers Left Without A Choice\n\n\"Because of my work here at Unemployed Workers United, I'm taken care of,\"\nBranch said. \"I don't have to worry as much about getting these funds next week\nor paying my rent or paying my car—but while I was out of work, those are the\nthings I was worrying about. I was terrified.\"\n\nDue to his work, Branch talks to people in the working class around the nation.\nThey all tell him the same thing: the jobs they were doing before aren't back. \nThat means either riding it out with governmental assistance as the pandemic\ndanger recedes — or taking a low paying job without the salary and protections\ntheir skill level should command.\n\n\"They're all saying, oh, everything's fine, we're back to the way it was, we're\nall good to go—people can go right back to work,\" Branch said. \"And that is just\nnot the reality. People have not caught up. Some people haven't even caught up\nfrom 2008.\"\n\nCompounding the problem is the unemployment benefit system, which places undue\nburdens on workers. The program's myriad hurdles are aimed at forcing people\nback to work—no matter what.\n\n\"People are really struggling and it is designed to dehumanize you and make you\nfeel as though it's you who's done something wrong, it's you who's not good\nenough,\" Branch said. \"That just can't be the narrative around worker\nprotections.\"\n\nThe socioeconomic hurdles of identity verification aren't lost on Dean. He noted\nthat access to primary documents is difficult under normal circumstances to the\npoor and working class—conditions which only worsened during the pandemic.\n\nThompson-Herfurth put it bluntly:\n\n\"It's disgusting that we have to go through this if we want to survive,\"\nThompson-Herfurth told me. \"We don't have a choice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal] \n\nPrinter Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nl0hah7HVNxb8KRmsyP0OjYU64p4HuUA/view?usp=sharing]","html":"<p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2021/08/image-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"885\" srcset=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/image-1.png 600w, https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/image-1.png 1600w, https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/size/w2400/2021/08/image-1.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p><em>This is a Guest Article for Notes on the Crises.

Long wait times and frustrating processes have been a marker for ID.me as the company has taken charge of identity verification in unemployment insurance systems around the country. In Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, landscaper Mark Samuel <a href=\"https://www.fox43.com/article/news/local/cumberland-county-man-says-he-cannot-get-someone-to-verify-his-identity-for-unemployment-benefits/521-fd9f1578-2623-42c0-a1f8-54b68718fde6?ref=crisesnotes.com\">told local affiliate Fox 43</a> on April 29 that he had been waiting 45 days to talk to someone in the company's video chat.</p><p>\"I'm extremely frustrated,\" Samuel said, \"and if I didn't have a full freezer, and we depended on this, and my wife got sick, and we didn't own a business, we'd be in pretty bad shape, and I'm sure there are others in bad shape.\"</p><p>Salmon didn't contest that there were problems in how the company does its work:</p><p>\"There are, I'm sure, absolutely thousands of individuals who got caught up in this who haven't been able to prove their identity, who are having a horrible time dealing with it,\" he told me. \"I am not an ID.me fanboy in any way.\"</p><p><strong>Delays for the Desperate</strong></p><p>Wait times at the video call center where \"Dean,\" a video support team member at the company, works were \"days long\" at points over the winter in December and January, he told me. It's hard to see how people survived, he said, given the way the system treated applicants—with or without ID.me verification delays.</p><p>\"I talk to roughly 45 people in an 8 hour shift, and a common statement is, 'all this has taken me a month, or two months, or two weeks, or three,'\" Dean said. \"There's obviously something going on that the system is not able to handle these things quickly.\"</p><p>Economist Steinbaum pointed to the company's pervasive issues as evidence of a careless approach to lifesaving benefits at the hands of a company <strong>using a moment of crisis to make a quick buck.</strong></p><p>\"The tech is bad, the data can be hacked, vulnerable people are assumed not to have ownership of their own data if they're applying for benefits anyway,\" he said.<strong> \"It's all just a gross concoction.</strong>\"</p><p>In comment, ID.me strenuously denied its wait times were in the days or weeks.CEO Hall  told me that ID.me doesn't usually have wait times exceeding 30 minutes at the most, at least now.</p><p>\"Wait times for Trusted Referee sessions have been consistently under 30 minutes for the past month and are currently in the single digits,\" he said.</p><p>As far as the higher wait times reported by people frustrated with the service, Hall put the onus for those delays on states for sending the company the entirety of their backlog at once.</p><p>\"We had multiple states send us months, and even a full years worth, of claimants to us for verification in several weeks due to the overwhelming fraud that preceded our introduction in that state. The states decided they would rather have wait times go up for a short period of time than to pay fraudulent claims out to organized crime rings. Of course, when states spiked demand for our services, wait times went up for several weeks, but that was not a function of ID.me’s capacity but rather a state choice to send their entire applicant pool to us for processing at once. ,\" Hall said.</p><p>Even if one accepts that as true, it's an irrelevant distinction to those waiting on the company for identity verification, and puts the lie to Hall's claim that \"no one is waiting days or weeks to verify — or even close to that.\" After all, not everyone has the time to wait hours on end to get through to someone on the other end of a video chat, assuming that their internet doesn't cut out and bump them back out of line. While ID.me's failures to provide verification in a timely manner has caused countless problems for users, the real issue with unemployment insurance is a deeper, systemic one, Thompson-Herfurth told me. A government-wide failure at the state and federal level to provide benefits to those who lost their jobs during an unprecedented economic crisis is at the root of the problem.</p><p>\"I think the government needs to step up and provide a better paying system for jobs,\" said Thompson-Herfurth.</p><p><strong>Organizing to Secure Support for the Unemployed</strong></p><p>Dustin Branch, a national digital and distributed organizer with Unemployed Workers United, currently located in Orlando, Florida, filed for unemployment last year and entered the labyrinthine world of identity verification that ID.me runs as part of its contracts with state governments. Branch, who worked for the Bernie Sanders campaign in Nevada in 2020, found himself out of work with the pandemic bearing down after the campaign shut down.</p><p>Like Maryland, Nevada's unemployment system requires people to get a Bank of America prepaid card for their funds, which are deposited into the account. You can do a check, Branch told me, but that takes months. It took him nearly a year to get through Nevada's unemployment insurance system and then the bank's identity verification system, run by ID.me, held up his payments.</p><p>\"It wasn't until March 15th of 2021 that I finally got my unemployment benefits,\" Branch said. <strong>\"So almost a full year from when I first applied</strong>—and the same day that I got notification that this deposit had been made, Bank of America blocked my card for identity verification. So there is no way for me to transfer it out.\"</p><p>He called the unemployment insurance system in Nevada to make sure the correct documents were in place, and the state agency assured him they were. <strong>But that didn't matter, </strong>ID.me didn't have his identity verified. He would eventually, in May—two months later—get the whole thing sorted out.</p><p>Branch, who called the verification process \"completely absurd,\" told me that while ID.me had his information from the moment he applied last year, the holds were put on anyway, evidence of the outdated system in place.</p><p>\"Thousands of people have been denied and had their claims and their benefits put on hold because of this,\" Branch said.</p><p>A California worker who dealt with ID.me in that state— who I’ll refer to as Stephen—was one of those people. He told me that fighting to verify his identity with the company was a nightmare. As well as being slow, the process almost resulted in him having to pay back four months of unemployment insurance benefits.</p><p>\"I’d only been back working for a couple of months at that point, after several months without any income,\" Stephen said. \"The idea of my wages being possibly garnished and owing back all that expanded UI was extremely stressful.\"</p><p>The process Stephen had to go through to verify his identity, he told me, was <strong>\"needlessly stressful and a huge time suck.\"</strong></p><p><strong>Unemployed Workers Left Without A Choice</strong></p><p>\"Because of my work here at Unemployed Workers United, I'm taken care of,\" Branch said. \"I don't have to worry as much about getting these funds next week or paying my rent or paying my car—but while I was out of work, those are the things I was worrying about. I was terrified.\"</p><p>Due to his work, Branch talks to people in the working class around the nation. They all tell him the same thing:<strong> the jobs they were doing before aren't back.</strong> That means either riding it out with governmental assistance as the pandemic danger recedes — or taking a low paying job without the salary and protections their skill level should command.</p><p>\"They're all saying, oh, everything's fine, we're back to the way it was, we're all good to go—people can go right back to work,\" Branch said. \"And that is just not the reality. People have not caught up. Some people haven't even caught up from 2008.\"</p><p>Compounding the problem is the unemployment benefit system, which places undue burdens on workers. The program's myriad hurdles are aimed at forcing people back to work—no matter what.</p><p>\"People are really struggling and it is designed to dehumanize you and make you feel as though it's you who's done something wrong, it's you who's not good enough,\" Branch said. \"That just can't be the narrative around worker protections.\"</p><p>The socioeconomic hurdles of identity verification aren't lost on Dean. He noted that access to primary documents is difficult under normal circumstances to the poor and working class—<strong>conditions which only worsened during the pandemic.</strong></p><p>Thompson-Herfurth put it bluntly:</p><p>\"It's disgusting that we have to go through this if we want to survive,\" Thompson-Herfurth told me. \"We don't have a choice.\"</p><p><br></p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><html> <center> \n    <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal\"   <button> Subscribe </button> </a> </br>  </center> \n</html><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><html> <center> \n    <br>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nl0hah7HVNxb8KRmsyP0OjYU64p4HuUA/view?usp=sharing&ref=crisesnotes.com\"   <button> Printer Friendly Version </button> </a> </br>  </center> \n</html><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><p></p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/id-me-says-there-has-been-massive-unemployment-benefits-fraud-should-we-believe-them/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"369217bb-1f18-4064-a1d3-c2f2f80e56cf","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"610ae4ac628114003baa6be8","reading_time":8}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"June 25","id":"Ghost__Post__60d611743937ad003e46c74b","title":"Will recovery funds really allow state and local governments to build back better?","slug":"will-recovery-funds-really-allow-state-and-local-governments-to-build-back-better","featured":false,"feature_image":null,"featuredImg":null,"excerpt":".","custom_excerpt":".","visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"25 June, 2021","published_at_pretty":"25 June, 2021","updated_at_pretty":"25 June, 2021","created_at":"2021-06-25T13:25:08.000-04:00","published_at":"2021-06-25T13:39:10.000-04:00","updated_at":"2021-06-25T13:39:10.000-04:00","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Notes on the Crises","slug":"crisesnotes","bio":null,"profile_image":null,"twitter":null,"facebook":null,"website":null}],"primary_author":{"name":"Notes on the Crises","slug":"crisesnotes","bio":null,"profile_image":null,"twitter":null,"facebook":null,"website":null},"primary_tag":null,"tags":[{"name":"#Crisesnotes","slug":"hash-crisesnotes","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"internal"},{"name":"Fiscal Policy","slug":"fiscal-policy","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},{"name":"Federalism","slug":"federalism","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"}],"plaintext":"\nThis is a Guest Article for Notes on the Crises\n\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal] \nAmanda Kass [https://twitter.com/Amanda_Kass] is the Associate Director of the\nGovernment Finance Research Center.\n\n\nPhilip Rocco [https://twitter.com/PhilipRocco] is an assistant professor of\npolitical science at Marquette University and co-author of Obamacare Wars:\nFederalism, State Politics, and the Affordable Care Act. \n\n\nThe phrase “Build Back Better” was at the heart of Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential\ncampaign. Yet during his first months in office, the President’s rhetoric and\npolicy proposals have been dominated by a central tension. Should the\nadministration’s emphasis be on building back, simply restoring the American\npolitical economy to its pre-pandemic status quo? Or on building something \nbetter: policies designed to address long standing inequalities, and insulate\nhouseholds and communities from future COVID-like shocks? \n\n\nThe tension between “building back” and “building better” is nowhere more\nvisible than in the debate over the American Rescue Plan Act’s (ARPA). ARPA\namounts to $350 billion in multipurpose aid allocated to states, Tribal\ngovernments, U.S. territories, and local governments. For fiscal hawks — who\nbelieve that “building back” should end when the crises lift —ARPA’s State and\nLocal Fiscal Recovery Funds are the height of federal profligacy. (Didn’t state\nand local revenues already bounce back from their nadir in the second quarter of\n2020? What else needs to be “built back”?) \n\n\nYet COVID-19 has also demonstrated that––far from an exogenous shock––crises are\nfundamentally shaped by pre-existing policy infrastructures. What did the\nCoronavirus crisis result in over the short term? Chronically underfunded city\nhealth departments and social service agencies struggled to deal with the\nearliest phases of the pandemic, as they waited for federal aid to arrive.\nOvercrowded school buildings with HVAC systems that hadn’t been updated in years\nmade it unsurprisingly difficult to adapt to pandemic conditions. These stark\nrealities require something beyond a reversion to the status quo — the ‘better’\nin Biden’s slogan. \n\n\nMore than this, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with a series of\npolice killings of Black Americans that were captured on video and seen by the\ngeneral public, including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. This violence sparked\na renewed call for racial justice in the United States, and it should force us\nto carefully examine who the American Rescue Plan will rescue. State and local\nrecipients of ARPA aid continue to operate in the shadow of the 2008 financial\ncrisis, which deepened racial and economic inequality in the United States.\nDefining “building back better” thus raises crucial questions about how to use\nfiscal aid to redress these inequalities. \n\n\nIs $350 Billion in State and Local Aid Necessary? \n\n\nThe passage of ARPA is nothing short of a milestone in the history of American\nfiscal federalism. Not since the creation in 1972 of General Revenue Sharing\n(GRS)––a fiscal program that delivered roughly $388 billion (current dollars)\nover 15 years in unrestricted federal aid to state and local governments––has\nCongress made such a significant commitment of multipurpose transfers for the\nwork that states, cities, and counties do. \n\n\nThe timing of ARPA’s passage, as the US vaccine rollout hit its stride and as\nstate and local revenue performed better than initially feared, led some\ncommentators to criticize the aid as wasteful and unnecessary. In a New York\nTimes article, for example, the senior policy director for the\nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget declared that states were “swimming\nin revenue” and, “It’s pretty clear to [him] that we spent a lot of money on\nstates that we didn’t need to.”\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/business/economy/republicans-biden-infrastructure-federal-aid.html] \nWhether fiscal aid was needed was hotly contested in the run-up to ARPA’s\npassage, and was almost cut from the bill. \n\n\nHowever, as we have argued elsewhere\n[https://www.governing.com/finance/the-myth-of-unnecessary-federal-aid-to-state-and-local-governments.html]\n, the notion that state and local governments no longer ‘need’ federal emergency\naid relies on a myopic understanding of need and is based on evaluating just the\nrevenue side of the ledger. First, simply because aggregate state and local\nrevenues have rebounded relative to the dismal position they were in during the\nsecond quarter of 2020 isn’t altogether reassuring. This does not mean that they\nare on track with where they would have been in the absence of the pandemic.\nAggregate figures, however, mask wide state and local variation. To what degree\nrevenue has rebounded also depends on what’s being examined, and commentaries\nand news on COVID’s revenue impact have used a variety of approaches, like\ncomparing actual 2020 vs. actual 2019 revenue and comparing actual 2020 revenue\nvs. estimates of 2020 revenue done at the start of the crisis. But the best\napproach is an event study, which compares actual revenue with an estimate of\nwhat revenue would have been but for the event (in this case, COVID). Using this\napproach, Professor Kenneth Kriz has estimated that COVID resulted in a nearly\n$1.5 billion revenue loss for the State of Illinois\n[https://igpa.uillinois.edu/sites/igpa.uillinois.edu/files/reports/EF4-Revenue-Forecast_012621.pdf]\n.\n\n\nSecond, COVID’s fiscal impact is not captured by revenue performance alone.\nWhile budget deficits tell us the gap between spending and revenue, this too\nprovides an incomplete picture. State and local governments are often bound by\nbalanced budget constraints, and their budgets also only capture planned \nspending — that is the spending levels that revenue can support. As such,\nbudgets are not meant to capture spending needs. The uneven impact of COVID and\nthe K-shaped economic recovery reflects pre-COVID societal inequalities. But\nstill more worryingly, it suggests a deepening of them. As such, spending needs\ngo beyond what’s recorded in a budget, to mitigating the direct and immediate\nhealth and economic consequences of COVID. It must also extend to factors that\nled the impact to be so uneven and dire, in the first place. And especially to\nprovide relief for low-income, Black and Brown communities.\n\n\nWhile COVID’s revenue impact is hotly tracked (albeit in different ways), less\neffort has been spent quantifying what it would cost to pay for all the direct\nand indirect spending needs. Take for example how the issue of unpaid sick\nleave\nhas led to hesitancy among some workers to get the vaccine. Workers have been\nreluctant due to worry that the possible side effects will lead to missed work\ndays\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/27/time-off-vaccine-workers/].\nThe public sector could guarantee paid vaccine sick leave, but the theoretical\ncost of doing so (and the societal cost of slowed vaccinations) are not captured\nin any budget or fiscal report. Such a cost would only be recorded if the money\nwas actually spent. \n\n\nHow Significant is ARPA for State and Local Governments?\n\n\nIt’s easier to understand the importance of ARPA’s Fiscal Recovery Funds by\ncomparing them to the Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF), the core multipurpose\ncomponent of the 2020 CARES Act’s aid to state and local governments. As the\ntable below shows, ARPA not only provides more than double the amount of aid\noffered by CARES, it entitles a far larger number of local governments (more\nthan 30,000) to be prime recipients of the aid. This means they are guaranteed\nfederal aid, and do not have to wait at the mercy of state governments for a\ndiscretionary “pass through.” The CARES Act allocated CRF funds based on\npopulation — while ARPA’s fiscal aid is allocated using several different\nformulae. \n\n\nYet perhaps the most distinguishing feature of ARPA is how state and local\ngovernments can use recovery funds. Under the CARES Act, multipurpose aid to\nstate and local governments proved cumbersome to use.Especially limited,\nofficials had to show that funds were used for necessary expenses tied directly\nto COVID-19’s health and economic impacts. In practice, this resulted in \nconfusion and delay [https://www.gfoa.org/materials/crf-recipient-perspective].\nResearchers at the National Academy of Public Administration found\n[https://www.naco.org/sites/default/files/documents/Coronavirus%20Relief%20Fund%20Review%20of%20Federal%20Fiscal%20Assistance%20and%20of%20Innovative%20County%20Response%20Strategies.pdf] \nthat the CARES Act’s restrictions on aid led to administrative burdens that\ndelayed the effective use of these dollars. They called for greater flexibility.\nAll in all, the design of ARPA appears to reflect some amount of policy learning\nas state and local governments have greater spending discretion. We compare key\naspects of each multipurpose aid program in the table below:\n\n\nComparing Multipurpose State and Local Aid in CARES Act and ARPA\n\n\n\nCARES Act\n\nARP Act\n\nTotal Amount of Aid\n\n$150 billion\n\n$350 billion\n\nAmount\n\nBy Unit of Government\n\n * $139 billion; State + Local Governments\n   \n   \n * $8 billion; Tribal Governments\n   \n   \n * $3 billion; DC + U.S. Territories\n   \n   \n\n * $195.3 Billion; State Governments + DC\n   \n   \n * $130.2 billion; Local Governments\n   \n   \n * $20 billion; Tribal Governments\n   \n   \n * $4.5 billion; U.S. Territories\n   \n   \n\nFund Name\n\nCoronavirus Relief Fund\n\nCoronavirus State And Local Fiscal Recovery Funds\n\nWho are Prime Recipients?\n\nStates, eligible local governments (based on population size), District of\nColumbia, U.S. Territories, and tribal governments\n\nStates, eligible local governments (based on population size), District of\nColumbia, U.S. Territories, and tribal governments\n\nLocal Government Prime Recipient Population Threshold\n\n500,000\n\nAll counties and metropolitan cities, and towns with a population of at least\n50,000\n\nNumber of Counties + Cities that Prime Recipients of Aid\n\n154\n\n30,000+\n\nFormula for Aid to State Governments\n\nPopulation\n\n$500 million per state plus share of $169 billion.

If spending is found\nto be ineligible, governments would have to pay back the funds to the federal\ngovernment. State and local governments can spend ARPA funds in three broad\npolicy categories[1]: \n\n\n * Addressing the direct health and economic impacts of COVID. Examples of\n   eligible spending includes payroll for public health workers, economic impact\n   payments to households, and replenishing state unemployment trust funds.\n   State and local governments must be able to directly connect spending that\n   falls into this category to the “disease itself or the harmful consequences\n   of the economic disruptions resulting from or exacerbated by the COVID-19\n   public health emergency\n   [https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/FRF-Interim-Final-Rule.pdf]” (p.\n   10).\n * Maintaining government services that would otherwise be jeopardized because\n   of COVID related revenue shortfalls. Spending in this category can be for\n   general government services, meaning the spending does not need to tie\n   directly to COVID. However, because this category is intended to address\n   revenue shortfalls, state and local governments have to provide the Treasury\n   Department with a calculation of COVID’s impact on their revenue to justify\n   spending in this category,. Furthermore, the use of Fiscal Recovery Funds for\n   this category cannot exceed the revenue loss. (The Interim Final Rule\n   specifies how governments are to calculate the revenue impact).\n * Infrastructure projects to address needs that existed pre-COVID and\n   exacerbated the crisis's impact. More specifically, the money can only be\n   spent on water, sewer, and/or broadband projects. For this category,\n   governments will have to provide the Treasury with information on “workforce\n   plans and practices” — although the additional reporting requirements have\n   yet to be determined. \n   \n\nAcross all three of these categories, the Treasury Department has encouraged\nstate and local governments to deploy funds in targeted ways that would benefit\ncommunities most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID’s health and economic\neffects, as we know, disproportionately fell on Black and Brown communities. And\ngiven that the pandemic exacerbated pre-existing disparities in these\ncommunities, Treasury has suggested that recipients may use funds to redress\nthose disparities, too. Among other things, that includes: “Remediation of lead\npaint or other lead hazards to reduce risk of elevated blood lead levels among\nchildren” and, “Evidence-based community violence intervention programs to\nprevent violence and mitigate the increase in violence during the pandemic\n[https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/FRF-Interim-Final-Rule.pdf]” (p.\n23).\n\n\nGiven the magnitude of the pandemic, as well as the scale of state and local\ngovernment needs that preceded it, the above categories of eligible uses is\nnecessarily broad. It constitutes the largest one-time transfer of multipurpose\nintergovernmental aid in decades.\n\n\nYet, importantly, multipurpose aid is not the same thing as unrestricted aid.\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, proposals for state and local relief funds\nhave assumed that these dollars could be used flexibly. However they are still\nprimarily allocated for the purpose of responding to the pandemic, covering\ncosts, or replacing foregone revenues.\n\n\nEven when compared to earlier proposals, such as the House-passed HEROES Act,\nARPA includes a number of additional restrictions on how state and local\nofficials can use federal dollars. It specifies that ARPA funds cannot be used\nto pay for state/local tax cuts, to pay down unfunded pension liabilities or\noutstanding debt, and/or replenish rainy day funds[2]. \n\n\nRestrictions on the Fiscal Recovery Funds reflect the tense political\nenvironment in which ARPA was passed. Republicans repeatedly placed Democrats on\nthe defensive over so-called “blue state bailouts” and preemptive charges that\nadditional aid was “not necessary” filtered in. For their part, Democrats\nclearly did not want to give Republicans at the subnational level the ability to\nclaim credit for a tax cut, in the midst of a pandemic year.\n\n\nIn addition to partisan friction, ARPA’s legislative guardrails––as well as\nTreasury’s interpretation of them––reflects a conceptual tension in the visions\nfor recovery aid. On the one hand, the legislation’s stated rationale of COVID\nrelief suggests a need to ensure that allocated funds are used in ways specific\nto the pandemic and go to support the local communities most impacted. Yet, if\nthe Biden administration’s policy goal is to build back stronger state and local\ngovernments than existed before the crisis, there’s some cause for concern. We\nshould recognize that governments’ inability to meet unfunded pension\nliabilities and other, outstanding debt burdens has contributed to the whittling\naway of core social and health services. This clearly became even more crucial\nduring the pandemic.\n\n\nMoreover, federal restrictions on aid and other reporting requirements add up to\nsignificant administrative burdens for state and local officials. In its own\nInterim Final Rule, the Department of Treasury estimates that reporting and\nauditing requirements may result in an annual 1.5 million hours of paperwork for\nall state and local governments, using the recovery funds. For comparison,\nconsider that General Revenue Sharing (1972–1986)––as a no-strings-attached\nprogram––included only minimal reporting requirements in the form of a one page\nreport on planned (and actual) use. Audits were only intended to reveal fraud or\nillegal activity[3]. Thus while the Treasury Department has a clear\nresponsibility for overseeing the proper use of ARPA funds, it will also be\nnecessary to ensure that audit culture does not become the enemy of effective\npolicy implementation. \n\nActual Use Report Form for General Revenue Sharing Program \n\n\n\n\nWill state and local governments be able to use ARPA dollars in transformative\nways? \n\n\nAs budget season heats up, ARPA dollars are recasting state and local fiscal\npolicy debates around the country. This comes in the context of calls for racial\njustice, and last year’s nationwide protests that were sparked by police\nkillings captured on video. Yet ARPA’s scale and flexibility do not guarantee\ntransformative policy. Rather, what matters are the decisions that state and\nlocal officials make now. These choices will be influenced not only by\npre-existing community needs and the macro-policy context, but also the role\nplayed by technical experts. As ever, experts are informed by the usual public\nfinance norms, and mobilized publics, that always appear in fiscal politics. \n\n\nThe history of General Revenue Sharing provides an instructive lesson about how\npotentially transformational reforms can––once implemented––revert to a logic of\nincrementalism. As one prominent study\n[https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_Revenue_Sharing_to_Deficit_Sharing/FcqYV8HiLvQC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PR3&printsec=frontcover] \nof the program concluded, despite high-flown rhetoric about the program’s\npotential to catalyze change in local governments, “city executives neither\nexpected nor reported actually using much of the new revenue to initiate new\nprograms or expand existing services.” Instead, GRS funds were far more\nfrequently used to maintain existing services, rather than to address needs not\ncurrently incorporated into city services. Local officials’ caution makes sense,\nespecially given that GRS transfers were not designed to increase with inflation\nor federal income tax collections. Moreover, by 1978 the program was enmeshed in\na context of local tax revolts, including significant cutbacks on\nintergovernmental aid to cities, and threats to retrench revenue sharing funds\nthemselves. \n\n\nPrior experiences with intergovernmental aid––as we have noted in a report\n[https://gfrc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/188/2021/04/GFRC_Strengthening-Local-Government-Finances.pdf] \npublished by the Government Finance Research Center––suggest that we need a\ndedicated, automatic intergovernmental aid program. One that expands during\nrecessionary periods, and contracts as normal economic conditions resume. A\none-time program, created months into an economic and public health crisis, is\nsimply not enough. \n\n\nStill, even in the absence of a permanent program with an automatic trigger,\nthere are ways to ensure that ARPA will fulfill its potential. One major\nchallenge that officials at all levels of government currently face is\ndeveloping the institutional architecture for planning ARPA spending. As one of\nus has written about earlier in the pandemic\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/state-and-local-austerity-is-a-death/] in Notes on\nthe Crises, the decay of formal institutions for intergovernmental relations has\nresulted in a more fragmented and chaotic policymaking context. The Treasury\nDepartment has only recently  set up an office to oversee the administration of\nrecovery funds. \n\n\nLocal governments are, to varying degrees, still establishing explicit processes\nand institutions to guide ARPA spending. Indeed, with limited planning capacity,\nlocal officials may choose “shovel ready” projects, which are easy and quick to\nimplement, rather than strategic investments (an issue seen with CARES Act\nspending\n[https://gfrc.uic.edu/slow-to-spend-state-approaches-to-allocating-federal-coronavirus-relief-funds/]\n). Using ARPA funds for the payroll of existing employees, for example, is\nadministratively less burdensome than creating a brand new program. \n\n\nIn addition to creating dedicated institutional capacity for ARPA planning,\nlocal officials must ensure the representation of community members whose voices\nare traditionally marginalized in the fiscal policy process. Because ARPA is a\none-time infusion of federal dollars, local officials may face pressure to\nsupport one-time capital improvement projects––including those already in the\nworks. There’s reason to worry that this could contribute to uneven development\nand gentrification. City officials may also be under pressure to devote one-time\nARPA funds to purposes that have a better chance of enhancing bond ratings, than\nthey do addressing outstanding needs. At the same time, the ability to use ARPA\nfunds to ensure communities have clean drinking water (as notoriously did not\nexist for Flint, Michigan) reflects how the act was informed by pre-pandemic\nissues. This speaks to the Biden administration’s vision that building back\nbetter entails tackling longstanding societal inequities. \n\n\nTo be sure, local officials in some cities appear to be striving for a more\nparticipatory model of decision-making where ARPA funds are concerned, with, for\nexample, Detroit holding 25 community meetings to solicit residents’ input\n[https://detroitmi.gov/government/mayors-office/american-rescue-plan-act]. In\nMilwaukee, a proposal is currently on the table to divide an equivalent\npercentage of ARPA funds among aldermanic districts “based on the principles of\nparticipatory budgeting.”\n[https://www.kpvi.com/news/national_news/milwaukee-leaders-seek-power-to-distribute-1-million-each-to-their-neighborhoods/article_6c6d3222-d0d7-560c-ba2d-80073a37875c.html] \nBut consultation and participation will likely not be sufficient to ensure that\nARPA funds are equitably spent. Rather, sustained mobilization by community\norganizations to expand the scope of conflict may help to develop policy\nalternatives that reflect the most urgent needs. They could also generate\ngreater attention to the typically obscure details of local fiscal policy. \nIn short, ARPA’s legacy and its capacity to close racial and economic\ndisparities is contingent on two things. First, on local capacity and how fiscal\npolicy experts deploy principles of public finance. Second,  on whether those\nwith the power to make decisions about how to spend the Fiscal Recovery Funds\nsee these issues as at the core of what it means to “build back better.”\n\n[1] In addition to the three categories, Fiscal Recovery Funds can also be used\nfor premium pay for essential work, and can be used for retrospective premium\npay. Premium pay is defined as up to $13 per hour, with a cap on how much an\nindividual worker can receive.\n\n[2] Fiscal Recovery Funds can, however, be used for the pension “payroll\ncontribution” that is part of an employee’s overall compensation and benefits\npackage. Treasury specifically differentiates “payroll contributions” with a\npension fund “deposit”, with the latter referring to an extraordinary payment\ninto a pension fund for the purpose of reducing an accrued, unfunded\nliability”).\n\n[3] This explains both the program’s popularity among state and local officials\nas well as its poor reputation with conservatives.\n\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal] \n\nPrinter Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VlhXzgeh1fuf1iHKVC0HRy5LMrQufiq9/view?usp=sharing]","html":"<p><br><em>This is a Guest Article for Notes on the Crises</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><html> <center> \n    <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal\"   <button> Subscribe </button> </a> </br>  </center> \n</html><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Amanda_Kass?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><strong>Amanda Kass</strong></a><strong> is the Associate Director of the Government Finance Research Center.</strong><br></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhilipRocco?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><strong>Philip Rocco</strong></a><strong> is an assistant professor of political science at Marquette University and co-author of </strong><em><strong>Obamacare Wars: Federalism, State Politics, and the Affordable Care Act</strong></em><strong>.</strong> <br></p><p>The phrase <strong>“Build Back Better”</strong> was at the heart of Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign. Yet during his first months in office, the President’s rhetoric and policy proposals have been dominated by a central tension. Should the administration’s emphasis be on <em>building back</em>, simply restoring the American political economy to its pre-pandemic status quo? Or on building something <em>better</em>: policies designed to address long standing inequalities, and insulate households and communities from future COVID-like shocks? <br></p><p>The tension between “building back” and “building better” is nowhere more visible than in the debate over the American Rescue Plan Act’s (ARPA). ARPA amounts to $350 billion in multipurpose aid allocated to states, Tribal governments, U.S. territories, and local governments. For fiscal hawks — who believe that “building back” should end when the crises lift —ARPA’s State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds are the height of federal profligacy. (Didn’t state and local revenues already bounce back from their nadir in the second quarter of 2020? What else needs to be “built back”?) <br></p><p>Yet COVID-19 has also demonstrated that––far from an exogenous shock––crises are fundamentally shaped by pre-existing policy infrastructures. What did the Coronavirus crisis result in over the short term? Chronically underfunded city health departments and social service agencies struggled to deal with the earliest phases of the pandemic, as they waited for federal aid to arrive. Overcrowded school buildings with HVAC systems that hadn’t been updated in years made it unsurprisingly difficult to adapt to pandemic conditions. These stark realities require something beyond a reversion to the status quo — the ‘better’ in Biden’s slogan. <br></p><p>More than this, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with a series of police killings of Black Americans that were captured on video and seen by the general public, including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. This violence sparked a renewed call for racial justice in the United States, and it should force us to carefully examine who the American Rescue Plan will rescue. State and local recipients of ARPA aid continue to operate in the shadow of the 2008 financial crisis, which deepened racial and economic inequality in the United States. Defining “building back better” thus raises crucial questions about how to use fiscal aid to redress these inequalities. <br></p><p><strong>Is $350 Billion in State and Local Aid Necessary? </strong><br></p><p>The passage of ARPA is nothing short of a milestone in the history of American fiscal federalism. Not since the creation in 1972 of General Revenue Sharing (GRS)––a fiscal program that delivered roughly $388 billion (current dollars) over 15 years in unrestricted federal aid to state and local governments––has Congress made such a significant commitment of multipurpose transfers for the work that states, cities, and counties do. <br></p><p>The timing of ARPA’s passage, as the US vaccine rollout hit its stride and as state and local revenue performed better than initially feared, led some commentators to criticize the aid as wasteful and unnecessary. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/business/economy/republicans-biden-infrastructure-federal-aid.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\">In a <em>New York Times </em>article, for example, the senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget declared that states were “swimming in revenue” and, “It’s pretty clear to [him] that we spent a lot of money on states that we didn’t need to.”</a>  Whether fiscal aid was needed was hotly contested in the run-up to ARPA’s passage, and was almost cut from the bill. <br></p><p>However, <a href=\"https://www.governing.com/finance/the-myth-of-unnecessary-federal-aid-to-state-and-local-governments.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\">as we have argued elsewhere</a>, the notion that state and local governments no longer ‘need’ federal emergency aid relies on a myopic understanding of need and is based on evaluating just the revenue side of the ledger. First, simply because <em>aggregate</em> state and local revenues have rebounded relative to the dismal position they were in during the second quarter of 2020 isn’t altogether reassuring. This does not mean that they are on track with where they would have been in the absence of the pandemic. Aggregate figures, however, mask wide state and local variation. To what degree revenue has rebounded also depends on what’s being examined, and commentaries and news on COVID’s revenue impact have used a variety of approaches, like comparing actual 2020 vs. actual 2019 revenue and comparing actual 2020 revenue vs. estimates of 2020 revenue done at the start of the crisis. But the best approach is an event study, which compares actual revenue with an estimate of what revenue would have been but for the event (in this case, COVID). Using this approach, <a href=\"https://igpa.uillinois.edu/sites/igpa.uillinois.edu/files/reports/EF4-Revenue-Forecast_012621.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Professor Kenneth Kriz has estimated that COVID resulted in a nearly $1.5 billion revenue loss for the State of Illinois</a>.<br></p><p>Second, COVID’s fiscal impact is not captured by revenue performance alone. While budget deficits tell us the gap between spending and revenue, this too provides an incomplete picture. State and local governments are often bound by balanced budget constraints, and their budgets also only capture <em>planned</em> spending — that is the spending levels that revenue can support. As such, budgets are not meant to capture spending needs. The uneven impact of COVID and the K-shaped economic recovery reflects pre-COVID societal inequalities. But still more worryingly, it suggests a deepening of them. As such, spending needs go beyond what’s recorded in a budget, to mitigating the direct and immediate health and economic consequences of COVID. It must also extend to factors that led the impact to be so uneven and dire, in the first place. And especially to provide relief for low-income, Black and Brown communities.<br></p><p>While COVID’s revenue impact is hotly tracked (albeit in different ways), less effort has been spent quantifying what it would cost to pay for all the direct and indirect spending needs. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/27/time-off-vaccine-workers/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Take for example how the issue of unpaid sick leave has led to hesitancy among some workers to get the vaccine. Workers have been reluctant due to worry that the possible side effects will lead to missed work days</a>. The public sector could guarantee paid vaccine sick leave, but the theoretical cost of doing so (and the societal cost of slowed vaccinations) are not captured in any budget or fiscal report. Such a cost would only be recorded if the money was actually spent. <br></p><p><strong>How Significant is ARPA for State and Local Governments?  </strong><br></p><p>It’s easier to understand the importance of ARPA’s Fiscal Recovery Funds by comparing them to the Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF), the core multipurpose component of the 2020 CARES Act’s aid to state and local governments. As the table below shows, ARPA not only provides more than double the amount of aid offered by CARES, it entitles a far larger number of local governments (more than 30,000) to be prime recipients of the aid. This means they are guaranteed federal aid, and do not have to wait at the mercy of state governments for a discretionary “pass through.” The CARES Act allocated CRF funds based on population — while ARPA’s fiscal aid is allocated using several different formulae. <br></p><p>Yet perhaps the most distinguishing feature of ARPA is how state and local governments can use recovery funds. Under the CARES Act, multipurpose aid to state and local governments proved cumbersome to use.Especially limited, officials had to show that funds were used for necessary expenses tied directly to COVID-19’s health and economic impacts. In practice, this resulted in <a href=\"https://www.gfoa.org/materials/crf-recipient-perspective?ref=crisesnotes.com\">confusion and delay</a>. Researchers at the National Academy of Public Administration <a href=\"https://www.naco.org/sites/default/files/documents/Coronavirus%20Relief%20Fund%20Review%20of%20Federal%20Fiscal%20Assistance%20and%20of%20Innovative%20County%20Response%20Strategies.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">found</a> that the CARES Act’s restrictions on aid led to administrative burdens that delayed the effective use of these dollars. They called for greater flexibility. All in all, the design of ARPA appears to reflect some amount of policy learning as state and local governments have greater spending discretion. We compare key aspects of each multipurpose aid program in the table below:<br></p><p><em>Comparing Multipurpose State and Local Aid in CARES Act and ARPA</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table

state and local governments’ spending nevertheless must align with the parameters outlined in the act itself. They’re also restricted by the Treasury’s subsequent rules. If spending is found to be ineligible, governments would have to pay back the funds to the federal government. State and local governments can spend ARPA funds in three broad policy categories[1]: <br></p><ul><li><strong>Addressing the direct health and economic impacts of COVID</strong>. Examples of eligible spending includes payroll for public health workers, economic impact payments to households, and replenishing state unemployment trust funds. State and local governments must be able to directly connect spending that falls into this category to the “<a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/FRF-Interim-Final-Rule.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">disease itself or the harmful consequences of the economic disruptions resulting from or exacerbated by the COVID-19 public health emergency</a>” (p. 10).</li><li>Maintaining <strong>government services</strong> that would otherwise be jeopardized because of COVID related revenue shortfalls. Spending in this category can be for general government services, meaning the spending does not need to tie directly to COVID. However, because this category is intended to address revenue shortfalls, state and local governments have to provide the Treasury Department with a calculation of COVID’s impact on their revenue to justify spending in this category,. Furthermore, the use of Fiscal Recovery Funds for this category cannot exceed the revenue loss. (The Interim Final Rule specifies how governments are to calculate the revenue impact).</li><li><strong>Infrastructure projects</strong> to address needs that existed pre-COVID and exacerbated the crisis's impact. More specifically, the money can only be spent on water, sewer, and/or broadband projects. For this category, governments will have to provide the Treasury with information on “workforce plans and practices” — although the additional reporting requirements have yet to be determined. <br></li></ul><p>Across all three of these categories, the Treasury Department has encouraged state and local governments to deploy funds in targeted ways that would benefit communities most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID’s health and economic effects, as we know, disproportionately fell on Black and Brown communities. And given that the pandemic exacerbated <em>pre-existing</em> disparities in these communities, Treasury has suggested that recipients may use funds to redress those disparities, too. Among other things, that includes: “<a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/FRF-Interim-Final-Rule.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Remediation of lead paint or other lead hazards to reduce risk of elevated blood lead levels among children” and, “Evidence-based community violence intervention programs to prevent violence and mitigate the increase in violence during the pandemic</a>” (p. 23).<br></p><p>Given the magnitude of the pandemic, as well as the scale of state and local government needs that preceded it, the above categories of eligible uses is necessarily broad. It constitutes the largest one-time transfer of multipurpose intergovernmental aid in decades.<br></p><p>Yet, importantly, <em>multipurpose </em>aid is not the same thing as <em>unrestricted</em> aid. Since the beginning of the pandemic, proposals for state and local relief funds have assumed that these dollars could be used flexibly. However they are still primarily allocated for the purpose of responding to the pandemic, covering costs, or replacing foregone revenues.<br></p><p>Even when compared to earlier proposals, such as the House-passed HEROES Act, ARPA includes a number of additional restrictions on how state and local officials can use federal dollars. It specifies that ARPA funds cannot be used to pay for state/local tax cuts, to pay down unfunded pension liabilities or outstanding debt, and/or replenish rainy day funds[2]. <br></p><p>Restrictions on the Fiscal Recovery Funds reflect the tense political environment in which ARPA was passed. Republicans repeatedly placed Democrats on the defensive over so-called “blue state bailouts” and preemptive charges that additional aid was “not necessary” filtered in. For their part, Democrats clearly did not want to give Republicans at the subnational level the ability to claim credit for a tax cut, in the midst of a pandemic year.  <br></p><p>In addition to partisan friction, ARPA’s legislative guardrails––as well as Treasury’s interpretation of them––reflects a conceptual tension in the visions for recovery aid. On the one hand, the legislation’s stated rationale of COVID relief suggests a need to ensure that allocated funds are used in ways specific to the pandemic and go to support the local communities most impacted. Yet, if the Biden administration’s policy goal is to build back stronger state and local governments than existed before the crisis, there’s some cause for concern. We should recognize that governments’ inability to meet unfunded pension liabilities and other, outstanding debt burdens has contributed to the whittling away of core social and health services. This clearly became even more crucial during the pandemic.  <br></p><p>Moreover, federal restrictions on aid and other reporting requirements add up to significant administrative burdens for state and local officials. In its own Interim Final Rule, the Department of Treasury estimates that reporting and auditing requirements may result in an annual 1.5 million hours of paperwork for all state and local governments, using the recovery funds. For comparison, consider that General Revenue Sharing (1972–1986)––as a no-strings-attached program––included only minimal reporting requirements in the form of a one page report on planned (and actual) use. Audits were only intended to reveal fraud or illegal activity[3]. Thus while the Treasury Department has a clear responsibility for overseeing the proper use of ARPA funds, it will also be necessary to ensure that audit culture does not become the enemy of effective policy implementation. </p><p><em>Actual Use Report Form for General Revenue Sharing Program </em><br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZP6Ub80-RdeL0L6bPL_obbVjq-hMlmbK36kv2JiQQ1qwf-lJgd19imT4hQL35E0g-0jF7aWklLswUwaib3EZeX4GUOUZ0uyS9exZZ8sD45wLGKKHkeHCwwJpATi_a7NoyOSghog\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p></p><p><strong>Will state and local governments be able to use ARPA dollars in transformative ways? </strong><br></p><p>As budget season heats up, ARPA dollars are recasting state and local fiscal policy debates around the country. This comes in the context of calls for racial justice, and last year’s nationwide protests that were sparked by police killings captured on video. Yet ARPA’s scale and flexibility do not guarantee transformative policy. Rather, what matters are the decisions that state and local officials make now. These choices will be influenced not only by pre-existing community needs and the macro-policy context, but also the role played by technical experts. As ever, experts are informed by the usual public finance norms, and mobilized publics, that always appear in fiscal politics. <br></p><p>The history of General Revenue Sharing provides an instructive lesson about how potentially transformational reforms can––once implemented––revert to a logic of incrementalism. As one prominent <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_Revenue_Sharing_to_Deficit_Sharing/FcqYV8HiLvQC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PR3&printsec=frontcover&ref=crisesnotes.com\">study</a> of the program concluded, despite high-flown rhetoric about the program’s potential to catalyze change in local governments, “city executives neither expected nor reported actually using much of the new revenue to initiate new programs or expand existing services.” Instead, GRS funds were far more frequently used to maintain existing services, rather than to address needs not currently incorporated into city services. Local officials’ caution makes sense, especially given that GRS transfers were not designed to increase with inflation or federal income tax collections. Moreover, by 1978 the program was enmeshed in a context of local tax revolts, including significant cutbacks on intergovernmental aid to cities, and threats to retrench revenue sharing funds themselves. <br></p><p>Prior experiences with intergovernmental aid––as we have noted in a <a href=\"https://gfrc.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/188/2021/04/GFRC_Strengthening-Local-Government-Finances.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">report</a> published by the Government Finance Research Center––suggest that we need a dedicated, automatic intergovernmental aid program. One that expands during recessionary periods, and contracts as normal economic conditions resume. A one-time program, created months into an economic and public health crisis, <strong>is simply not enough.</strong> <br></p><p>Still, even in the absence of a permanent program with an automatic trigger, there are ways to ensure that ARPA will fulfill its potential. One major challenge that officials at all levels of government currently face is developing the institutional architecture for planning ARPA spending. As one of us <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/state-and-local-austerity-is-a-death/\">has written about earlier in the pandemic</a> in <em>Notes on the Crises</em>, the decay of formal institutions for intergovernmental relations has resulted in a more fragmented and chaotic policymaking context. The Treasury Department has only recently  set up an office to oversee the administration of recovery funds. <br></p><p>Local governments are, to varying degrees, still establishing explicit processes and institutions to guide ARPA spending. Indeed, with limited planning capacity, local officials may choose “shovel ready” projects, which are easy and quick to implement, rather than strategic investments (<a href=\"https://gfrc.uic.edu/slow-to-spend-state-approaches-to-allocating-federal-coronavirus-relief-funds/?ref=crisesnotes.com\">an issue seen with CARES Act spending</a>). Using ARPA funds for the payroll of existing employees, for example, is administratively less burdensome than creating a brand new program. <br></p><p>In addition to creating dedicated institutional capacity for ARPA planning, local officials must ensure the representation of community members whose voices are traditionally marginalized in the fiscal policy process. Because ARPA is a one-time infusion of federal dollars, local officials may face pressure to support one-time capital improvement projects––including those already in the works. There’s reason to worry that this could contribute to uneven development and gentrification. City officials may also be under pressure to devote one-time ARPA funds to purposes that have a better chance of enhancing bond ratings, than they do addressing outstanding needs. At the same time, the ability to use ARPA funds to ensure communities have clean drinking water (as notoriously did not exist for Flint, Michigan) reflects how the act was informed by pre-pandemic issues. This speaks to the Biden administration’s vision that building back better entails tackling longstanding societal inequities. <br></p><p>To be sure, local officials in some cities appear to be striving for a more participatory model of decision-making where ARPA funds are concerned, with, for example, <a href=\"https://detroitmi.gov/government/mayors-office/american-rescue-plan-act?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Detroit holding 25 community meetings to solicit residents’ input</a>. In Milwaukee,<a href=\"https://www.kpvi.com/news/national_news/milwaukee-leaders-seek-power-to-distribute-1-million-each-to-their-neighborhoods/article_6c6d3222-d0d7-560c-ba2d-80073a37875c.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> a proposal is currently on the table to divide an equivalent percentage of ARPA funds among aldermanic districts “based on the principles of participatory budgeting.”</a> But consultation and participation will likely not be sufficient to ensure that ARPA funds are equitably spent. Rather, sustained mobilization by community organizations to expand the scope of conflict may help to develop policy alternatives that reflect the most urgent needs. They could also generate greater attention to the typically obscure details of local fiscal policy. <br>In short, ARPA’s legacy and its capacity to close racial and economic disparities is contingent on two things. First, on local capacity and how fiscal policy experts deploy principles of public finance. Second,  on whether those with the power to make decisions about how to spend the Fiscal Recovery Funds see these issues as at the core of what it means to <strong>“build back better.”</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> In addition to the three categories, Fiscal Recovery Funds can also be used for premium pay for essential work, and can be used for retrospective premium pay. Premium pay is defined as up to $13 per hour, with a cap on how much an individual worker can receive.</p><p><strong>[2] </strong>Fiscal Recovery Funds can, however, be used for the pension “payroll contribution” that is part of an employee’s overall compensation and benefits package. Treasury specifically differentiates “payroll contributions” with a pension fund “deposit”, with the latter referring to an extraordinary payment into a pension fund for the purpose of reducing an accrued, unfunded liability”).</p><p><strong>[3]</strong> This explains both the program’s popularity among state and local officials as well as its poor reputation with conservatives.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><html> <center> \n    <br>\n<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal\"   <button> Subscribe </button> </a> </br>  </center> \n</html><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><html> <center> \n    <br>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VlhXzgeh1fuf1iHKVC0HRy5LMrQufiq9/view?usp=sharing&ref=crisesnotes.com\"   <button> Printer Friendly Version </button> </a> </br>  </center> \n</html><!--kg-card-end: html-->","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/will-recovery-funds-really-allow-state-and-local-governments-to-build-back-better/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"ab29c7f5-c20c-45a4-8525-5dcc57c59488","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"60d611743937ad003e46c74b","reading_time":13}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1022999749","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
