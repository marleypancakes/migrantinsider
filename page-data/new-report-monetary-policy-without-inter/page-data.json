Regular\nreaders will know that insights from MMT inform all my writing on this\nnewsletter on various different topics. But I prefer to focus on my analysis of\nunfolding situations, rather than arguing about the framework that lies behind\nmy thinking. Nonetheless, in other contexts this is an important part of my\nwork. I am the research director of the Modern Money Network, after all. A major\nproject that I took on as lead author preceding the pandemic came out of the\ndebate over MMT in 2019. (As an introduction to Modern Monetary Theory, I wrote\nout a talk on the subject originally delivered to a Federal Credit Union, which \nyou can find here\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-gave-a-talk-to-a-federal-credit/])\n\nIt is hard to remember those long ago days but, at the time, the debate about\nModern Monetary Theory was over whether it makes sense to say that inflation and\nthe availability of physical resources was the main constraint to expansionary\nfiscal policy. In contrast, mainstream commentators came out of the woodwork to\nsay no, if you run deficits that are too big, even if there isn’t an issue with\ninflation, the national debt will get out of control and bond markets will\n“punish” you. Some even claimed that the Trump tax cuts meant that the U.S. had\n“run out of ammo” for the next recession. In their framing, fiscal policy was\nsupposed to manage the national debt and monetary policy — specifically interest\nrate policy — was supposed to manage the economy and preserve full employment\nplus price stability. \n\n\nMore sophisticated commentators claimed that MMT may be right — but it didn’t\nmatter much. Josh Barro, who was at New York Magazine at the time, claimed:\n\nIf the government prints and spends money when the economy is at or near full\nemployment, MMT counsels (correctly) that this will lead to inflation, and\nprescribes deficit-reducing tax increases to reduce aggregate demand and thereby\ncontrol inflation. See how we have ended up back where we started? Whether you\ntake a Keynesian view or an MMT view, if the government spends more, it’s likely\ngoing to need to tax more, sooner or later. [...] Whatever the Federal Reserve’s\ndemerits, the idea of depending on Congress to pass surplus-generating tax\nincreases in order to keep the economy stable and prevent runaway inflation\ngives me hives.\n\nBarro’s piece signaled that we were in a new phase of the debate. While many\nmainstream economists embarrassingly held onto the idea of the national debt\n“spiraling out of control”, it was clear that more and more commentators would\ngravitate to Barro’s idea. They came to argue that it doesn’t matter much\nwhether you are “balancing the budget” or “budgeting for inflation”. \n\n\nMy colleagues and I saw various dangers in this new framing. For one thing,\nwhile we thought a focus on inflation and physical resources was a vast\nimprovement over a focus on the size of the national debt, we had a very\ndifferent view of prices and aggregate demand than mainstream commentators.\nPolicymakers who naively focused on headline inflation could miss key\nbottlenecks in specific sectors which wouldn’t be solved by throttling demand \n(whether that throttling came from fiscal policy or monetary policy). Further,\nthere are a variety of cost-based and market structure-grounded reasons that\nprices can increase when output is widely available. \n\n\nEven when aggregate demand and income growth is the main cause of shortages and\nprice increases, it does not follow that the only possible response is raising\ntaxes or fiscal policy. Restrictive financial regulation, or even non-financial\nregulation can restrict demand (that’s a point I will return to). Later on, I\nwould coin the phrase “non-fiscal payfors” to emphasize that in “demand terms”,\nexpansionary fiscal policy could be “offset” by restrictive non-fiscal policy\nrather than tax increases or other spending cuts. Contra Barro, this is a very\ndifferent world than the one envisioned by mainstream economic policy or the\npartisan economists who populate its conventional wisdom.\n\n\n\nTo head off Barro’s view becoming the new conventional wisdom and preemptively\nclarify these misunderstandings (as well as confusions I discuss below), UMKC\nprofessor Scott Fullwiler, MMN president (and now professor) Rohan Grey and I\nwrote an op-ed for the Financial Times\n[https://www.ft.com/content/539618f8-b88c-3125-8031-cf46ca197c64]. In\ndiscussions with our colleagues at the organization Our Money, it became clear\nthat they were interested in financing a report to flesh out the idea that\ntightening financial regulation could serve as an alternative to both interest\nrate hikes and tax increases. I became lead author and spent a lot of my time in\n2019 and early 2020 leading up to the pandemic working on this report. Thanks to\nmy colleagues at the Modern Money Network, particularly Michael Brennan, I am\nproud to announce that “The New Monetary Policy: Reimagining Demand Management\nand Price Stability in the 21st Century”\n[https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf] is finished and ready for\npublic consumption.\n\n\nThe New Monetary Policy is focused on how the budgeting — and policymaking —\napproaches used by government agencies, particularly the Congressional Budget\nOffice, would need to change and adjust in order to incorporate and take full\nadvantage of non-fiscal payfors. It examines the various different elements of\ncontemporary financial regulation and considers which financial regulatory tools\nwould be most suited to managing demand. Finally, it recommends two suites of\nfinancial regulatory tools, geared towards different political contexts. One\nsuite, dubbed the “Build Back Better” approach, focuses on how financial\nregulation could come to serve a demand management role without major\ndisruptions to the current approaches to budgeting and monetary policy. It is\nmeant to exemplify that policymakers can benefit from MMT insights about\nmanaging aggregate demand without signing up to a Permanent Zero Interest Rate\non Government debt (PZIRG) policy.\n\n\nOur more “aggressive” policy suite, dubbed “Green New Deal” monetary policy, is\nmeant to show the kind of demand-management tools available via financial\nregulation if policymakers (and the public) become interested in freeing up a\nvast array of physical resources for Green New Deal mobilization. We also\nemphasize that avoiding U.S. interest rate hikes is especially important in the\ncontext of the United States, where dollar interest rates impact countries\ndeeply indebted in dollars, both in dollar terms and in terms of their exchange\nrates. Whether it is the pandemic response or the climate response, raising\ndollar interest rates is inconsistent with tackling these global problems on a\nglobal scale. The planned Federal Reserve interest rate hikes are already having\nadverse impacts on much of the rest of the world.\n\n\nThere is much more in The New Monetary Policy than I can go over here. That’s\nwhy readers should read it! One thing, however, that the report is not about is\nour current “inflation” situation. As I stated earlier, it was mostly written in\n2019 and has only been updated in the places where contemporary circumstances\nare the most critical to the argument. While we flesh out more of our thoughts\nabout the “non-demand” elements of inflation and price stability, that topic is\nnot the main focus of this report. The role that competition law and other areas\nof law that directly impact business price-making have in aiming for a true full\nemployment economy with price stability is a subject that deserves its own paper\nor report. My work with colleagues Sanjukta Paul\n[https://files.crisesnotes.com/universityofstthomaslawjournal.pdf] and Luke\nHerrine [https://files.crisesnotes.com/labourincompetitionlaw.pdf] will\ncertainly play a key role in a full developed framework answering those\nquestions. In the meantime, I am going to write about recent arguments over this\ntopic later this week, and the more general arguments over pandemic-related\nprice increases.\n\nWhat I can say here is that the pandemic has vindicated many of these points.\nConcerns over where the United States would “find the money” (rather than\n“finding the resources”) for various fiscal initiatives dissolved in the\npandemic as the Federal Reserve launched an array of programs (which I became\nwell known for). Congress also passed trillions of dollars in spending\ninitiatives without offsets of any kind. In fact, just yesterday Professor\nStephanie Kelton was profiled in a New York Times Profile entitled “Time For a\nVictory Lap*\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/business/economy/modern-monetary-theory-stephanie-kelton.html]\n” on this exact point. Meanwhile, the pandemic became a major real world example\nof non-financial regulation contracting demand throughout the economy. In other\nwords, pandemic measures reduce demand which actually required expansionary\nfiscal policy to “offset”.\n\n\nAs if this all were not enough, our concern that the mainstream view that\ninflation is only caused by excess aggregate demand would mean particular supply\nchain bottlenecks would be used to justify demand restraint has been prescient.\nThe business press is now daily focused on the intimate details of supply\nchains. That new focus is based on the idea that you need to understand those\nintricacies to understand wider economic conditions, and what would be the most\neffective policy response. \n\n\nWe were worried about how these potential future bottlenecks would play out\npolitically at a time when few other commentators were focused on such issues.\nNow president Biden commonsensically says\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-04/biden-rebrands-reagan-s-supply-side-economics-to-save-build-back-better-agenda]\n: “if car prices are too high right now, there are two solutions: You increase\nthe supply of cars by making more of them, or you reduce demand for cars by\nmaking Americans poorer.” Naturally, he concludes he endorses the former.\nBiden’s Federal Reserve, however, still appears poised to pursue the latter.\n\n\nThe New Monetary Policy is a major step in laying out an alternative to the\northodox policy consensus — and I look forward to producing more work in the\nfuture that fleshes out that alternative even more.\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]Printer Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TdEA9E3mJOt-dBJzVnn3eL8dG_1BNZJC/view?usp=sharing]","html":"<div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>I don’t spend a lot of time writing about Modern Monetary Theory on <em>Notes on the Crises</em>.
