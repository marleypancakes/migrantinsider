To\nbriefly summarize, the Biden administration committed to further emptying the\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. At  the same time, they committed to buying oil\nover the next few years, at specified minimum prices. Depending on your point of\nview, the timing of my piece was either perfect or extremely bad. The very next\nday the world was caught off guard by a surprise deal between Senate Majority\nLeader Chuck Schumer, and habitual enfant terrible Joe Manchin. \n\n\nSchumer and Manchin’s fiscal deal, amusingly named the “Inflation Reduction\nAct”, is far smaller than the original Build Back Better proposal. It is also\nmuch smaller than the cut down proposals people tried to get Manchin to accede\nto. But it is still something, and better than nothing. It also has a number of\nclimate provisions, but also Oil and Gas provisions. A colleague of mine\ndescribed it as a “quarter of a loaf” — and I am still deciding whether I would\neven be that generous. Nonetheless, it is something at a time when it seemed\nlike there might not be any further fiscal action at all.\n\n\nEver since both announcements came down I have been trying to formulate what I\nthink about both issues. In particular, I have a strong sense that these are\ndeeply related topics.  My issues with both Employ America’s proposal and the\nInflation Reduction Act are deeply intertwined, but it has been difficult to\narticulate. At their core, both policy shifts indicate an emerging approach to\nclimate change that emphasizes growing both the fossil fuel and renewable energy\nindustries in the near term, and crucially only phasing out fossil fuel\nproduction when it is convenient. This is a policy which involves no disruptions\nwhich will need to be managed. In this view, emissions are purely “induced” by\nthe demand for goods and services. They don’t involve particular production\nchoices by fossil fuel businesses themselves.\n\n\nBefore diving into my problems with this perspective, I want to speak to one\ntype of criticism I got from readers after my EA piece. I have many, many\nreaders who are interested in my financial markets analysis, and maybe even some\nof my macroeconomic analysis but who think I should stay out of topics like\nclimate change. That will not be happening. \n\n\nUltimately, the only reason to be interested in macroeconomics is to want to\ncontribute to policy which will improve people’s lives at a systematic level and\naccomplish important societal goals. No goal is more important than responding\nto climate change today. My monetary policy report\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/new-report-monetary-policy-without-interest-rate-hikes/] \nfrom earlier this year is in large part about using direct credit regulation as\npart of a macroeconomic strategy for dealing with climate change. \n\n\nAs a result, I can’t “stay neutral” on these topics. I have developed my own\nview of Climate Change, and the very substantial body of empirical evidence and\nexpert opinion among scientists and energy specialists so that I can provide\nuseful and accurate macroeconomic analysis. This doesn’t mean I won’t continue\nto write about granular financial market issues (as the Monetary Policy report\nitself demonstrates). But just as I’ve commented on the coronavirus pandemic\nwith an eye to the actual public health situation, I will now do the same with\nclimate change. \n\n\nI will also say that ignoring issues of climate change would also make my\nanalysis of monetary policy and financial regulation less accurate over time. I\ncan attest from my experience attending the Journal of Financial Regulation\nconference [https://twitter.com/JFinReg/status/1555164505700720645] two weeks\nago that climate change is very much a contemporary part of the monetary policy\nconversation, and will not be going away any time soon.\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]With that out of the way,\nlet’s return to the issue at hand. The core idea of the Inflation Reduction Act\nis pairing a series of tax credits for renewable energy, battery storage and so\non with approvals for fossil fuel infrastructure, and mandatory auctioning of\noil and gas drilling leases on federal lands. Now at one level, this is merely\nwhat they needed to agree to to get Senator Manchin on board. Or more\naccurately, this is what Manchin proposed, and what Democratic party leadership\nagreed to more or less sign on the dotted line. \n\n\nAt another level though, I think this bill also represents some intellectual\nshifts on climate change in Washington DC. Over a decade ago, climate change\npolicy was defined by proposals to “price carbon” (under strong influence by\northodox economists), and more general restrictions on fossil fuel development.\nIt was seen as an area where, more or less, you either “do climate policy” by\n“giving in” to climate change advocates — or you don't. There were problems with\nthis perspective, as I discussed in some detail in my original piece about\nEmploy America. And it’s thankfully no longer the limit to these discussions. In\nresponse to the failures of the climate movement during the Obama years—and in\nthe upheaval of the Trump administration—different policy ideas surrounding\nclimate change emerged\n[https://www.volts.wtf/p/some-thoughts-on-the-inflation-reduction]. Tying\nclimate change to true full employment policies (particularly at the low end of\nthe labor market) and transformative spending projects, rather than carbon\npricing gained credence. The idea of a “Green New Deal” encapsulated many of\nthese emerging intellectual trends.\n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, in a bizarre and unintended way, shares this\nintellectual lineage even if it's a fraction of the proposed green spending. It\nfocuses on transformative spending tax credits rather than schemes to “put a\nprice on carbon”. However, it also goes beyond that. Rather than simply “not\npricing carbon” or directly restricting fossil fuel development, it ties these\nspending projects to supporting fossil fuel projects. In the context of looming\nbottlenecks and high energy prices, part of the “inflation reduction” plan today\nis clearly to boost fossil fuel production. The Biden Administration’s\nimplementation of Employ America’s proposal signals to me that these elements\nare not merely “concessions”. They are part of an intellectual trend that has\nextrapolated from the deemphasis of carbon pricing to a broader worldview. One\nwhere currently stable fossil fuel prices—without pursuing things that will\nreduce energy demand—is the most important priority.\n\n\nWhen challenged by climate activists, scientists and specialists who recognize\nthe obvious need to phase out fossil fuel production as quickly as possible,\nadvocates of this worldview give one of two answers.The first foregrounds the\npreviously mentioned issue that this was “the best that can be gotten”. This\nclaim, while hard to argue with, is missing some key points. For one thing, now\nthat the legislation is passed there is nothing stopping the Biden\nadministration from doing everything it can possibly do to discourage energy\nconsumption (besides selective arguments about electoral success)  Second,\nsettling for a “compromise” does not mean you have to gild the proverbial lily,\nand make it out as something better than it is.\n\nThe second response dismisses concerns about increased fossil fuel production.\nThis argument points to projections of significant emission reductions relative\nto the “no Inflation Reduction Act” status quo. Petroleum and Gas production is\nprojected to fall by 13% and 8% respectively by 2030 according to the REPEAT\nProject\n[https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Prelminary_Report_2022-08-12.pdf],\none of the major modelers of the energy and emission consequences of different\nU.S. legislation. As the researchers behind this project will tell you\nthemselves, there is considerable uncertainty built into their projections.\nThese are also relatively small projected cuts. The REPEAT project does a good\njob of pointing out that variations in U.S. oil and gas production will largely\nbe determined by variations in the rest of the world’s demand for U.S. energy.\n\n\n\n\nUnder their “high” Oil and Gas scenario, U.S. Oil and Gas production is not all\nthat different a decade from now. This is in large part because of a large run\nup in oil and gas exports. Their estimate of the additional emissions as a\nresult of this production does not count the emissions from using these fossil\nfuels. As such, it is at least partially an undercount of emissions (depending\non how you want to think about the demand for fossil fuels). It’s worth \npointing\nout that the U.S. had a longstanding ban on exporting crude oil\n[https://newrepublic.com/article/164307/bidens-energy-secretary-dodges-question-oil-gas-exports] \nfrom 1975 to 2015 that was lifted in December 2015 (just days after the Paris\nAgreement on Climate was signed…) \n\n\nReinstating that ban while the Ukraine crisis continues is likely not a good\nidea. However, we shouldn’t treat these export-based emissions as natural and\ninevitable over the long term when they are a result of a remarkably recent\npolicy change. It's hard not to look at these numbers and think that U.S. policy\nis aimed at continuing to be a fossil fuel exporting power house to the 2040s\nand beyond. The logic of using the U.S. Treasury to stabilize energy markets\nleads seamlessly to the U.S. becoming an even greater fossil fuel exporter (and\nit's already number two). Not burning the fossil fuels we produce is starting to\nbe rhetorically reframed as purely the problem of those who import them. Of\ncourse, market conditions can shift rapidly. Fossil fuel prices collapsed in\n2020.\n[https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/selected-fossil-fuel-prices-in-2019-2020]\nWe are only at the beginning of a decade of intense instability. Conditions\ncould still easily shift rapidly against U.S. fossil fuel exports. However, just\nas the 2014-2015 fossil fuel bust was not an intentional goal of policy, we\nshouldn’t credit any future fossil fuel busts to the policy suites that are now\neasing constraints on fossil fuel production.\n\n\nIt is well beyond the scope of this piece to provide a full assessment of the\nclimate implications of the Inflation Reduction Act. Others are\n[https://www.drilledpodcast.com/manchins-inflation-reduction-act-whats-good-and-bad-for-climate/] \n after all\n[https://www.volts.wtf/p/some-thoughts-on-the-inflation-reduction?utm_source=podcast-email&utm_medium=email#details] \n better suited\n[https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2022/08/11/modeling-ira-carbon-cuts-caveats-uncertainty-and-luggage-00050741] \nto that task. However, I do want to comment on one further element I found\ntroubling in looking at the REPEAT Project\n[https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Prelminary_Report_2022-08-12.pdf]’s\nforecasts. A significant percentage of their forecasted emission reductions come\nfrom “carbon capture and storage”. Professor Jenkins, who heads the project,\nconfirmed for me on twitter that 20% of the forecasted emission reductions comes\nfrom a rapid scaling up of still nascent CCS technologies. As professor Charles\nHarvey and his industrialist coauthor Kurt House pointed out just today in the\nNew York Times\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/opinion/climate-inflation-reduction-act.html]\n, more than 90% of the commercial CCS projects in the United States are\ncapturing carbon dioxide in order to inject it into the ground and “enhance oil\nrecovery”. This makes CCS tax credits to fossil fuel producers, especially Oil\nand Gas, another fossil fuel subsidy.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Jenkins is quick to point out that if carbon capture in electricity\ngeneration does not scale up, this does not mean that all those emissions gains\nare lost. That’s quite correct: instead, this may simply mean that wind and\nsolar power expands even more than in his forecasts. Obviously, the forecast is\nalso subject to considerable uncertainty — so the exact numbers should not be\ntaken so seriously. However, that does not stop news articles from bandying\nabout numbers from these forecasts, as if they are established matters of fact.\nBen Storrow in Politico Pro had an excellent article\n[https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2022/08/11/modeling-ira-carbon-cuts-caveats-uncertainty-and-luggage-00050741] \non the three main climate models assessing the Inflation Reduction Act, and the\nvery considerable uncertainty involved in these forecasts. It is also possible\nthat very pessimistic assumptions about carbon capture would make these\nforecasted emission reductions far less rosy. Without the models being rerun,\nit's hard to say anything definitive.\n\n\n\nFinally, an important element of these forecasts renews focus on state and local\npolicy, both in zoning and in fiscal policy. To grow at the projected pace,\nsignificant non-financial barriers need to be swept out of the way. From land\nuse laws to utility rules and everything in between, there are many reasons why\na basic financial incentive to pursue receiving a tax credit may not be enough.\nIn particular, these forecasts involve an unprecedented rate of growth in solar\nand wind investment. These models also assume that adequate transmission and\nstorage will be built to accommodate whatever renewable energy is generated.\nThis is a herculean assumption — as the modelers themselves will readily tell\nyou. \n\nMy point is not that this forecast should be discounted, but rather that local\nand state actors\n[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ira-climate-states_n_62f54317e4b045e6f6abb444] \n(both governmental and non-governmental) will need to make these forecasts true.\nA huge fight is already gearing up over energy policy now that the Inflation\nReduction Act is law.  Subnational fiscal policy may readily expand in\nanticipation of being “repaid” by utility customers, and these federal tax\ncredits. Using public investment to speed up these decarbonization investments\nwill become newly attractive, in a post-IRA world. Even if you aren’t\nparticularly interested in climate change as a topic, this big brewing fight at\nthe state and local level will potentially reshape the U.S. economy. The\naftermath of the IRA will significantly change the finances of large segments of\nthe private sector and public sector. You may not be interested in climate\npolicy, but climate policy is interested in you.\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]Printer Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-h0mMJoTBLh51EXn7V1HqNNsWYtiEh-4?usp=sharing]","html":"<div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>At the end of July, a few hours after I wrote about <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-insuring-the-oil-and-gas-industry-the-right-response-to-the-fallout-from-ukraine/\">Employ America’s Oil and Gas proposal</a>, the Biden administration implemented a modified form of their proposal.

Professor Jenkins, who heads the project, confirmed for me on twitter that 20% of the forecasted emission reductions comes from a rapid scaling up of still nascent CCS technologies. As professor Charles Harvey and his industrialist coauthor Kurt House <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/opinion/climate-inflation-reduction-act.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\">pointed out just today in the New York Times</a>, more than 90% of the commercial CCS projects in the United States are capturing carbon dioxide in order to inject it into the ground and “enhance oil recovery”. This makes CCS tax credits to fossil fuel producers, especially Oil and Gas, another fossil fuel subsidy.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IqnJEHgTJmLAXLyo6mXwjYtA6WvYRzej6iNezY1djgigiDG2MVK0bnjI26NukYKfy0LpT-l6VjUWpFg6nw1F2NhPwtACYW15PfSvOdfdWJ19u7oWqXUXCabw6tU9GDUtVEHmi6-Zo_nPY5xHv6e24A\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><br></p><p>Professor Jenkins is quick to point out that if carbon capture in electricity generation does not scale up, this does not mean that all those emissions gains are lost. That’s quite correct: instead, this may simply mean that wind and solar power expands even more than in his forecasts. Obviously, the forecast is also subject to considerable uncertainty — so the exact numbers should not be taken so seriously. However, that does not stop news articles from bandying about numbers from these forecasts, as if they are established matters of fact. Ben Storrow in Politico Pro <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2022/08/11/modeling-ira-carbon-cuts-caveats-uncertainty-and-luggage-00050741?ref=crisesnotes.com\">had an excellent article</a> on the three main climate models assessing the Inflation Reduction Act, and the very considerable uncertainty involved in these forecasts. It is also possible that very pessimistic assumptions about carbon capture would make these forecasted emission reductions far less rosy. Without the models being rerun, it's hard to say anything definitive.<br></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5xK9jNqs-6cW90lOW344dnfy7GdrIJqLvrLFA9RqL58VJc4ydZ_OfBJD8-l7xPu9An-Tp6YxT5j2L7w3GohTKcGA8uKDgGFGQe0aFGuhl7DTDv533AerrZc-q8qRu8k8gy_Ls56E31ByowSdFehhNw\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><br>Finally, an important element of these forecasts renews focus on state and local policy, both in zoning and in fiscal policy. To grow at the projected pace, significant non-financial barriers need to be swept out of the way. From land use laws to utility rules and everything in between, there are many reasons why a basic financial incentive to pursue receiving a tax credit may not be enough. In particular, these forecasts involve an unprecedented rate of growth in solar and wind investment. These models also assume that adequate transmission and storage will be built to accommodate whatever renewable energy is generated. This is a herculean assumption — as the modelers themselves will readily tell you. <br><br>My point is not that this forecast should be discounted, but rather <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ira-climate-states_n_62f54317e4b045e6f6abb444?ref=crisesnotes.com\">that local and state actors</a> (both governmental and non-governmental) will need to <strong>make</strong> these forecasts true. A huge fight is already gearing up over energy policy now that the Inflation Reduction Act is law.  Subnational fiscal policy may readily expand in anticipation of being “repaid” by utility customers, and these federal tax credits. Using public investment to speed up these decarbonization investments will become newly attractive, in a post-IRA world. Even if you aren’t particularly interested in climate change as a topic, this big brewing fight at the state and local level will potentially reshape the U.S. economy. The aftermath of the IRA will significantly change the finances of large segments of the private sector and public sector. <strong>You may not be interested in climate policy, but climate policy is interested in you.</strong></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-h0mMJoTBLh51EXn7V1HqNNsWYtiEh-4?usp=sharing&ref=crisesnotes.com\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Printer Friendly Version</a></div>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-inflation-reduction-act-employ-america-and-oil-gas-now-what/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"7e360e28-d4c2-4447-b751-9ee7b3aca225","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"62fb8e72693255003d2cae20","reading_time":9}},"pageContext":{"slug":"the-inflation-reduction-act-employ-america-and-oil-gas-now-what","limit":10,"skip":0}},"staticQueryHashes":["1022999749","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
