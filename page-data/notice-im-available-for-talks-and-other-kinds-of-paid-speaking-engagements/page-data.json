This came out of people reaching out to me organically inquiring if this was an option. I did it here and there, but never in a consistent fashion and it has never been a regular revenue stream for Notes on the Crises. Now that I have a physical office in Manhattan and that I’m looking to expand- and events have slowed down since the most intense phase of the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis- I think it's time that I finally put it out more publicly that this is an option. I’m especially interested in this because I’m set up to push speaking/consulting revenue directly into more investigative reporting. I was concerned that this sort of thing would distract me from reporting at a crucial moment, but now I think we have turned the corner where the revenue will do more for Notes on the Crises reporting than the time would.\n\nI have a sliding scale of hourly rates. The highest tier is the “for profit company” rate. Then there is a “large non-profit” rate and a “small non-profit/community organization” rate . I don’t list these rates publicly; serious inquiries will get a price quote in reply. For enough hours booked (with a travel premium), and travel expenses paid, I’m willing to travel to you. Otherwise I’m available over Zoom et al. or in person in New York City (including in my conference room). I will forgo a travel premium for bookings in the San Francisco area, where I have a place to stay and my own reasons to visit.\n\nI want to be clear about what I am not available for. I will not give investment advice- I am not a licensed financial advisor nor is that particularly something I want to pursue. I also won’t provide advance notice of ongoing investigations or details I know to be true but do not have good enough sourcing to report publicly. If you want me to give a talk to your organization, or want to pick my brain on a specific topic, it is in reference to better understanding what I’ve written publicly or because you want the benefit of my general knowledge of the financial or economic system, as well as the legal system and the way it interacts with financial and macroeconomic issues.\n\nRecent things I’ve written about that I’m available to discuss is the Bureau of Fiscal Service and its compromise, 80.5 million dollars being debited directly from New York City’s bank account and the ACH system, Trump’s tariffs, their legality and the legal discretion the executive branch has over Tariffs, and the vulnerabilities in our hedge fund-based financial and monetary system exposed by the Trump Tariff Financial Panic. I can also talk about the stock market as a “conventional wisdom processor” & the importance of foreign exchange swaps to the international financial system. I can also talk about the “spectrum of monetary sovereignty” or any other topic in my back catalog of articles or your own bespoke topic. Of course, I am also available to talk about today’s piece regarding the elimination of the Office of Financial Research.\n\nSo reach out over email at crisesnotes@gmail[dot]com if you’re interested. ","html":"<div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"mailto:crisesnotes@gmail.com\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">email me to inquire</a></div><p>I- Nathan Tankus- have never mentioned it to my email list, but in the fine print of my website I’ve always listed that I’m available for paid speaking engagements.
