It's past time to examine where we’ve been, where we stand as of this writing and what it all means.\n\nFirst, I want to get the less significant issue out of the way. From the beginning of this episode I’ve treated the allegations of “mortgage fraud” against Lisa Cook to be a lazy pretext. I, of course, did not believe these allegations at any point. However, what was more important than the truth or falsity of the allegations was the clear motivations of the Trump administration itself. Nevertheless, over the last few weeks we have gotten confirmation that the charges are unfounded. \n\nReuters first broke the news on September 13th that Governor Cook’s Atlanta mortgage application explicitly marks the residence as a “vacation home”. Bloomberg news independently confirmed Reuters findings. The allegation of mortgage fraud against Lisa Cook coming from the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s head Bill Pulte is not unique. In fact, over the weekend a federal prosecutor resigned over the pressure to prosecute New York Attorney General Letitia James over mortgage fraud claims he didn’t find sufficient grounds for.\n\nNevertheless, I continue to think that the central issues in this case are about the constitution and the centralization of power in our legal system. They are neatly summarized by the September 2nd filing from Lisa Cook’s lawyers:\n\nI. The Court Has The Authority To Determine Whether The President Complied With The Fra’s “For Cause” Removal Provision\n\nII. President Trump’s Purported Basis For Firing Governor Cook Does Not Amount To “Cause.”\n\nIII. Governor Cook Had A Right To Proper Notice And A Meaningful Opportunity To Be Heard Prior To Being Fired\n\nIV. The Events Before President Trump Purportedly Fired Governor Cook Do Not Amount To Proper Notice And A Hearing\n\nIn other words, they are about the protections against removal by the president. The various arguments from the defense are about the scope and meaningfulness of this “for cause” limitation. Is the president “complying” with the limitation? Does the cited “cause” truly “amount” to cause? Did Cook receive sufficient due process and does the “for cause” provision in the Federal Reserve Act imply due process? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the questions that had, previous to the rise of “unitary executive theory”, been seen as mostly settled by the case Humphrey's Executor. Yet, the Supreme Court has been acting like that precedent was already overturned. Just yesterday they issued an emergency stay, effectively allowing Trump to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter without cause (she had just been reinstated by a Federal Judge). The brief decision is, however, quite clear on the fact that they plan to formally overturn the decision:\n\nThe parties are directed to brief and argue the following questions: (1) Whether the statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade Commission violate the separation of powers and, if so, whether Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), should be overruled. (2) Whether a federal court may prevent a person’s removal from public office, either through relief at equity or at law. The Clerk is directed to establish a briefing schedule that will allow the case to be argued in the December 2025 argument session. The stay shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court\n\nIt's worth quoting justice Kagan’s dissent (joined by Sotomayor and Jackson) because they make clear what the stakes of the Supreme Court majority’s recent behavior:\n\nYet the majority, stay order by stay order, has handed full control of all those agencies to the President. He may now remove—so says the majority, though Congress said differently—any member he wishes, for any reason or no reason at all. And he may thereby extinguish the agencies’ bipartisanship and independence.\n\nAs discussed previously, the supreme court has dangled the possibility of \"Humphrey's Executor for the Federal Reserve only” in front of the public or- more accurately- Wall Street. This is best understood as “fool’s gold”. \n\nAs an aside, I want to briefly note that I was quite happy to see that Cook’s lawyers cited the monograph I discussed in my first piece on this topic a month ago. It's always gratifying to see substantial impact from the documents one digs up:\n\nIn 1972, the Federal Reserve’s longtime General Counsel, Howard Hackley, explained that “[p]resumably, a Board member, like a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, cannot be removed by the President except for ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.’ Since the enactment of the original [Federal Reserve] Act – a period of nearly 60 years – no President has attempted to remove a member of the Board.’” Howard Hackley, The Status of the Federal Reserve System in the Federal Government, 50 (1972). The first part of Hackley’s statement—that the FRA’s “for cause” removal provision means INM—remains true. Unfortunately, the second part of his statement no longer does. \n\nMeanwhile, back at the burning court house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hackley quote is relevant to my core point insofar as it emphasizes that the core protections against the removal of Federal Reserve Board of Governors come from the general law surrounding independent agencies rather than anything specific or special about the Federal Reserve. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, in her decision ruling in Cook’s favor, commented on this at length:\n\n“It is a commonplace of statutory interpretation that ‘Congress legislates against the backdrop of existing law.’” Parker Drilling Mgmt. Servs., Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. 601, 611 (2019) (quoting McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383, 398 n.3 (2013)). Accordingly, the Court finds highly persuasive Cook’s argument that the Federal Reserve Act’s use of “for cause” should also be read in light of prior statutory removal provisions for Presidentially appointed, Senate confirmed roles. Those provisions consistently limited the grounds for presidential removal of agency heads or members to some combination of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance (referred to in shorthand as INM), which meant “cases where officials act wrongfully in office” (malfeasance), “fail to perform their statutory duties” (neglect of duty), “or perform them in such an inexpert or wasteful manner that they impair the public welfare” (inefficiency). Jane Manners & Lev Menand, The Three Permissions: Presidential Removal and the Statutory Limits of Agency Independence, 121 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 8 (2021)\n\nIt's nice to see courts engage Notes on the Crises friend Lev Menand’s scholarship on presidential removal powers. More fundamentally, the only way to substantiate the meaning of “for cause” in the Federal Reserve Act is the treatment by similar statutory schemes.\n\nJudge Cobb notes that Lisa Cook was not given a chance to confront the evidence against her nor given any ability to respond to Pulte’s allegations:\n\nThe Court is highly doubtful that Cook should have been required to piece together the evidentiary basis for a “for cause” removal from a scattered assortment of social media posts and news articles. \n\nEven if the notice provided had been sufficient, Cook’s due process rights were nevertheless likely violated because she was not given a “meaningful opportunity” to be heard. Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 543. At no point did President Trump indicate that Cook would be provided an opportunity to argue that the allegations were untrue or did not merit removal, or invite Cook to submit such evidence.[...]\n\nInstead, shortly after Director Pulte’s social media post was made public, President Trump called for Cook to resign—a far cry from inviting an opportunity to contest the allegations\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Trump administration appealed this decision on September 10th.\n\nThe Appeals Court issued a rapid decision on September 15th the following week. This three judge panel also ruled in Cook’s favor- but under “partisan” lines i.e. two Biden appointees versus one Trump appointee. This is foreboding because it could be a preview of a partisan decision by the Supreme Court. In reading these various opinions, it's clear that judges are struggling to come to conclusions with Humphrey’s Executor only half repealed and the “Federal Reserve” exception only gestured at by the Supreme Court itself. The current jurisprudence implies that Lisa Cook is one of the few officials vested with “executive power” with for cause protections on the planet. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dissenting Trump appointee in the Federal Court of Appeals case provides a significant hint at where the Supreme Court might go. The “specialness” of the Federal Reserve cuts both ways. On one hand, it may grant special protections not given to any other “principal officer”. On the other hand, its very importance and uniqueness leans towards reading the provision “for cause” narrowly and in favor of presidential discretion over its own removal powers. To wit:\n\nMoreover, the Board of Governors no doubt is important, but that only heightens the government’s interest in ensuring that its Governors are competent and capable of projecting confidence into markets. And in empowering the President to remove Governors for cause, Congress has specifically assigned that task to the President.\n\nWe are thus left with four possibilities. First, the Supreme Court will officially strike down Humphrey’s Executor for all agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Open Market Committee. Second, the Supreme Court will issue another “emergency stay” overturning lower courts decisions but without providing any reasoning justifying Lisa Cook’s firing. Third, the supreme court may leave Lisa Cook in place and eventually solidify the “unitary executive minus the Federal Reserve System theory”. Fourth, the supreme court may remove Lisa Cook while, at the same time, solidifying the “unitary executive minus …” theory while emptying it of content. In many ways using more emergency stays without any stated reasoning on the place of the Federal Reserve in the federal government would be the worst of all possible worlds.\n\nSome readers may think that, in light of the events of September, my piece last month entitled “Powell Will Hang Separately: The Federal Reserve Has Already Failed its Duty to Lisa Cook and the Constitution” was hasty and premature. I certainly took a very strong position early on in the process. It is also true that the early litigation has gone faster and more smoothly than I expected. Lisa Cook was able to vote at last week’s FOMC meeting. Yet, I will hold to my position. First, the controversy over Lisa Cook should have disrupted the appointment of Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve Board. It did not, and in fact the senate got him in in time to cast his dissenting vote last week alongside Cook. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost fundamentally, the real challenge at this stage is the Supreme Court. I’m sure Powell feels comforted that the “heat” is less intense than it was three weeks ago. But that heat, however uncomfortable, is also the Federal Reserve’s most stalwart ally. Letting the supreme court further erode the legal protections Powell and his fellow governors have will be devastating and letting the pressure subside makes that more likely. Lots of eyes were on the Federal Reserve press conference last Wednesday and Powell squandered the opportunity. When asked about whether Miran’s appointment to the Board while remaining on leave from the Council of Economic Advisors, Powell replied:\n\nWe're strongly committed to maintaining our independence and beyond that I really don't have anything to share\n\nVictoria Guida at Politico valiantly tried to keep the question at the front of the press conference and Powell simply avoided the issue:\n\nVICTORIA GUIDA. Do you see the court case around Lisa Cook as being related to questions of Fed independence? \n\nCHAIR POWELL. You know, I see it as a court case that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on. \n\nIn a narrow legal sense these deflections may be wise but as the Supreme Court claims more and more power for the president, Powell’s legal capacity to object will become so small that it can be drowned in a bathtub. Powell may want federal reserve independence to remain above the muck of partisan politics, but it's too late. It's already there. The Federal Reserve can jump into the muck with a strategy and a plan to get out, or it can let itself be drowned in the muck by a Supreme Court issuing final judgment.","html":"\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Buy a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>The developments in the legal fight between the Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and the second Trump administration have evolved quite rapidly over the past three weeks.

Yet, the Supreme Court has been acting like that precedent was already overturned. Just yesterday they issued an emergency stay, effectively allowing Trump to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter without cause (she had just been reinstated by a Federal Judge). The brief decision is, however, quite clear on the fact that <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a264_o759.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>they plan to formally overturn the decision</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The parties are directed to brief and argue the following questions: (1) Whether the statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade Commission violate the separation of powers and, if so, whether Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), should be overruled. (2) Whether a federal court may prevent a person’s removal from public office, either through relief at equity or at law. The Clerk is directed to establish a briefing schedule that will allow the case to be argued in the December 2025 argument session. The stay shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court</blockquote><p>It's worth quoting justice Kagan’s dissent (joined by Sotomayor and Jackson) because they make clear what the stakes of the Supreme Court majority’s recent behavior:</p><blockquote>Yet the majority, stay order by stay order, has handed full control of all those agencies to the President. He may now remove—so says the majority, though Congress said differently—any member he wishes, for any reason or no reason at all. And he may thereby extinguish the agencies’ bipartisanship and independence.</blockquote><p>As discussed previously, the supreme court has dangled the possibility of \"Humphrey's Executor for the Federal Reserve only” in front of the public or- more accurately- Wall Street. This is best understood as “fool’s gold”.&nbsp;</p><p>As an aside, I want to briefly note that I was quite happy to see that Cook’s lawyers cited the monograph I discussed in <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/trump-vs-powell-the-big-takeaways-from-trumps-assault-on-the-federal-reserve/\"><u>my first piece on this topic a month ago</u></a>. It's always gratifying to see substantial impact from the <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.284270/gov.uscourts.dcd.284270.17.0_4.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>documents one digs up:</u></a></p><blockquote>In 1972, the Federal Reserve’s longtime General Counsel, Howard Hackley, explained that “[p]resumably, a Board member, like a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, cannot be removed by the President except for ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.’ Since the enactment of the original [Federal Reserve] Act – a period of nearly 60 years – no President has attempted to remove a member of the Board.’” Howard Hackley, The Status of the Federal Reserve System in the Federal Government, 50 (1972). The first part of Hackley’s statement—that the FRA’s “for cause” removal provision means INM—remains true. Unfortunately, the second part of his statement no longer does.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, back at the burning court house.</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Buy a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>The Hackley quote is relevant to my core point insofar as it emphasizes that the core protections against the removal of Federal Reserve Board of Governors come from the general law surrounding independent agencies rather than anything specific or special about the Federal Reserve. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, in her decision ruling in Cook’s favor, <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.284270/gov.uscourts.dcd.284270.27.0_7.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>commented on this at length:</u></a></p><blockquote>“It is a commonplace of statutory interpretation that ‘Congress legislates against the backdrop of existing law.’” Parker Drilling Mgmt. Servs., Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. 601, 611 (2019) (quoting McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383, 398 n.3 (2013)). Accordingly, the Court finds highly persuasive Cook’s argument that the Federal Reserve Act’s use of “for cause” should also be read in light of prior statutory removal provisions for Presidentially appointed, Senate confirmed roles. Those provisions consistently limited the grounds for presidential removal of agency heads or members to some combination of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance (referred to in shorthand as INM), which meant “cases where officials act wrongfully in office” (malfeasance), “fail to perform their statutory duties” (neglect of duty), “or perform them in such an inexpert or wasteful manner that they impair the public welfare” (inefficiency).

Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 543. At no point did President Trump indicate that Cook would be provided an opportunity to argue that the allegations were untrue or did not merit removal, or invite Cook to submit such evidence.[...]</blockquote><blockquote>Instead, shortly after Director Pulte’s social media post was made public, President Trump called for Cook to resign—a far cry from inviting an opportunity to contest the allegations</blockquote><p>Unsurprisingly, the Trump administration appealed this decision on September 10th.</p><p>The Appeals Court issued a rapid decision <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cadc.42372/gov.uscourts.cadc.42372.01208775757.0.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>on September 15th the following week</u></a>.

I will have a premium piece about what he has to say about my “conventional wisdom processor” idea next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake out a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn extremely popular apocryphal anecdote in American politics claims that when the Declaration of Independence was signed Benjamin Franklin said “we must all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately”. It doesn’t seem to be true, having first surfaced more than 50 years after the signing of the declaration of independence. Yet it has had staying power. This staying power comes from a fundamental truth that it artfully expresses: opponents to a powerful force are easily picked off one by one and the only way to avoid that fate is to stand together and defend one another. \n\nSo much in our culture suggests an understanding of this. Whether it's this apocryphal Franklin quote, Niemöller’s “First They Came” poem or contempt for British prime minister Neville Chamberlain and his policy of appeasement, Americans are inculcated with a sense that solidarity- even solidarity across ideological differences and deeply felt disagreements- are the key to defeating authoritarianism. Yet despite having constantly been seeded with this fundamental lesson, the second Trump administration has been marked by a remarkable failure of spine across all the institutions in the United States. The early sign that American institutions would engage in systematic appeasement towards Trump in his second term was the eagerness for the most powerful law firms in the country to quickly concede to Trump and enter “agreements” with his administration. \n\nThe Federal Reserve System has not been the most craven of the powerful institutions who have attempted to placate Trump to defend themselves, but it has not been the bravest institution either. As I discussed last Friday, they were quick to concede to Trump on financial regulatory issues in the hopes that would get Trump off their back. They also ignored the attack on the legal architecture propping up independent administrative agencies in the hopes that other agencies would receive the brunt of Trump’s wrath. This is a choice to “hang separately” in the hopes that the Fed won’t hang at all. In short, the Federal Reserve has not had a particularly good record the past seven months.\n\nThe past two weeks are, however, something different. Trump first posted about the allegations of “mortgage fraud” against Lisa Cook Wednesday August 20th, 9 days ago. This was right on the eve of the most important central banking conference in the world, the Kansas City Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Federal Reserve chairman Powell’s speech is always the most anticipated speech at this conference and it may have been the most anticipated speech from a Federal Reserve chairperson ever. It was Powell’s final speech at this conference given his term is ending next May. It was anticipated because of what he might say about the Trump administration’s various attacks on the Federal Reserve and government data collection more generally. \n\nPowell's speech instead was entitled …“Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy”. In many respects it was a speech he could have delivered in 2019. You would never know a fundamental attack on his agency was in the works. Lisa Cook was destined to be fired in short order from the moment Powell stepped away from the podium without coming to her defense- or the defense of his own institution for that matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake out a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Trump has attempted to fire Lisa Cook. Chairman Powell has not said anything in her defense as of this writing. The Federal Reserve Board has given this statement to reporters, which I will publish in full because it is not broadly accessible- itself telling:\n\nThe Federal Reserve System was established by Congress to carry out its statutory mandates—including promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and a well-functioning financial system. \n\nCongress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only “for cause.” Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people. \n\nThe Federal Reserve will continue to carry out its duties as established by law. \n\nLisa Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. As always, the Federal Reserve will abide by any court decision. \n\nThe Federal Reserve reaffirms its commitment to transparency, accountability, and independence in the service of American families, communities, and businesses. [emphasis added]\n\nThis statement is fairly weak and anodyne. \n\nMore importantly, the language regarding Lisa Cook’s lawsuit of the Trump administration suggests that they are not treating her as a governor able to effectuate her duties. I think we would have heard reports if she was locked out of the building. But it's possible that the Federal Reserve is taking a “middle-ground path” where she can come into the building but will not have votes at Board meetings- or, crucially, Federal Open Market Committee meetings (i.e. the meetings where the Federal Reserve sets interest rates). It's notable that Powell and the Federal Reserve Board themselves are “co-defendants” in Governor Cook’s lawsuits. Part of the relief the lawsuit seeks is:\n\nAn injunction against the Non-Presidential Defendants ordering that they refrain from effectuating President Trump’s illegal attempt to fire Governor Cook and treat Governor Cook as a member of the Board of Governors\n\nIf you work in the Federal Reserve System and have knowledge of Lisa Cook’s current status at the Federal Reserve Board please contact me on signal at username NathanTankus.01 or over email at crisesnotes@gmail.com. \n\nThe Federal Reserve’s official statement doesn’t even come close to suggesting that the allegations are false or a pretext. The Trump administration has provided no evidence for its allegations of “mortgage fraud” against Lisa Cook and an individual can have multiple “principal residences”, as President Trump himself has. Recall that the allegation of “Fraud” is simply that Governor Cook took out two mortgages in a relatively short period of time for properties that were both listed as “principal” residences. In federal tax law you can only have one “primary residence” but mortgage law is not tax law and a “principal residence” is not a “primary residence”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake out a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is, of course, besides the point. Before anyone heard a single detail about the allegations it was obvious they were and are a pretext. But this isn’t going to necessarily be clear to the broad public and certainly not to Wall Street with its lackadaisical approach to the second Trump Administration. That is why I ended my Politico op ed discussing the role of leadership:\n\nThis is where the role of leaders come in. Leadership — especially leadership with widespread credibility on Wall Street — can effectively change the game. A particularly respected leader could make the rule of law a far more active part of how the stock market arrives at its conventional wisdom.\n\nThe leader I have in mind is, of course, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nIf Powell does not come to Cook’s defense and continue to treat her as a governor-in-good-standing, he will be the Fed chair who oversaw the destruction of the Federal Reserve’s prized independence. Given the financial industry’s myopic worldview about Trump’s second term so far, Powell’s willingness to defend not just the future of the economy but the rule of law in the United States might be one of the few things that could shake it awake. Powell has a duty not just to the institution he holds dear but to the United States Constitution and the American people to speak forthrightly at this very late hour.\n\nThe evidence is that Powell is unfortunately well on his way to sealing the Federal Reserve’s fate.\n\nPowell already made the critical error of “hanging separately” from the rest of the administrative state. The news this week of the attempted firing of the head of the Center for Disease Control emphasizes that there are areas more important than central banking where non-partisan expertise needs insulation from short term partisan political interference. He seems to have made the choice for each governor of the Federal Reserve to now hang separately from each other. Powell will, in turn, hang both separately and alone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake out a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnless, of course, he makes the decision to stand up for the rule of law and explain that the attack is not merely on the central bank, but democracy and the constitution. Powell should give a public, primetime television speech explaining the stakes, that the president’s order was legally invalid and that the Federal Reserve system will ignore the order. Federal Reserve Board General Counsel Mark Van Der Weide and the legal division of the Federal Reserve Board are no doubt advising Powell that any such bold action would open Powell up to the risk of a “for cause” firing from Trump himself. Their legal analysis is sound but their political instincts are wrong. \n\nWhen your opponent is Donald Trump you escalate in response to threats; you don’t try to appease him. Powell must do everything in his power to compel the conventional wisdom of market traders to more adequately “price in” the degradation of the rule of law. This must include tying the rule of law and the threats to the constitution to the credibility and standing of the Federal Reserve itself. Powell’s term expires in less than a year anyway. If defending the constitution and his own institution is not worth the risk, what would be? The Federal Reserve has already made the error of letting itself become isolated from the attacks on the rest of the administrative state. Powell can still change course, but time is running out. Federal Reserve Chairman Powell: hang together with Lisa Cook.","html":"\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive kg-cta-no-dividers   \" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                        <div class=\"kg-cta-text\">\n                            <p><i><em class=\"italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">This is a free Notes on the Crises article.

Lisa Cook was destined to be fired in short order from the moment Powell stepped away from the podium without coming to her defense- or the defense of his own institution for that matter.</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Take out a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>Now Trump has attempted to fire Lisa Cook. Chairman Powell has not said anything in her defense as of this writing. The Federal Reserve Board has given <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/peark.es/post/3lxda2tsgf22p?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>this statement to reporters</u></a>, which I will publish in full because it is not broadly accessible- itself telling:</p><blockquote>The Federal Reserve System was established by Congress to carry out its statutory mandates—including promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and a well-functioning financial system.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only “for cause.” Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>The Federal Reserve will continue to carry out its duties as established by law.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Lisa Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would <strong>confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System</strong>. As always, the Federal Reserve <strong>will abide by any court decision</strong>.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>The Federal Reserve reaffirms its commitment to transparency, accountability, and independence in the service of American families, communities, and businesses. [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>This statement is fairly weak and anodyne.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, the language regarding Lisa Cook’s lawsuit of the Trump administration suggests that they are not treating her as a governor able to effectuate her duties. I think we would have heard reports if she was locked out of the building. But it's possible that the Federal Reserve is taking a “middle-ground path” where she can come into the building but will not have votes at Board meetings- or, crucially, Federal Open Market Committee meetings (i.e. the meetings where the Federal Reserve sets interest rates). It's notable that Powell and the Federal Reserve Board themselves are “co-defendants” in Governor Cook’s lawsuits. Part of the <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.284270/gov.uscourts.dcd.284270.1.0_17.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>relief the lawsuit seeks is</u></a>:</p><blockquote>An injunction against the Non-Presidential Defendants ordering that they refrain from effectuating President Trump’s illegal attempt to fire Governor Cook and treat Governor Cook as a member of the Board of Governors</blockquote><p>If you work in the Federal Reserve System and have knowledge of Lisa Cook’s current status at the Federal Reserve Board please contact me on signal at username NathanTankus.01 or over email at <a href=\"mailto:crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><u>crisesnotes@gmail.com</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Federal Reserve’s official statement doesn’t even come close to suggesting that the allegations are false or a pretext. The Trump administration has provided no evidence for its allegations of “mortgage fraud” against Lisa Cook and an individual can have <a href=\"https://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2025/08/the-presidents-firing-of-lisa-cook-is-illegal.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>multiple “principal residences”</u></a>, as President <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/03/25/521474657/multiple-homes-mean-more-costly-protection-for-presidents?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Trump himself has</u></a>. Recall that the allegation of “Fraud” is simply that Governor Cook took out two mortgages in a relatively short period of time for properties that were both listed as “principal” residences. In federal tax law you can only have one “primary residence” but mortgage law is not tax law and a “principal residence” is not a “primary residence”.</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Take out a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>This is, of course, besides the point. Before anyone heard a single detail about the allegations it was obvious they were and are a pretext. But this isn’t going to necessarily be clear to the broad public and certainly not to Wall Street with its lackadaisical approach to the second Trump Administration. That is why I ended <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/new-politico-op-ed-on-trumps-attempted-firing-of-fed-governor-lisa-cook/\"><u>my Politico op ed</u></a> discussing the role of leadership:</p><blockquote>This is where the role of leaders come in. Leadership — especially leadership with widespread credibility on Wall Street — can effectively change the game. A particularly respected leader could make the rule of law a far more active part of how the stock market arrives at its conventional wisdom.</blockquote><blockquote>The leader I have in mind is, of course, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.</blockquote><blockquote>If Powell does not come to Cook’s defense and continue to treat her as a governor-in-good-standing, he will be the Fed chair who oversaw the destruction of the Federal Reserve’s prized independence. Given the financial industry’s myopic worldview about Trump’s second term so far, Powell’s willingness to defend not just the future of the economy but the rule of law in the United States might be one of the few things that could shake it awake. Powell has a duty not just to the institution he holds dear but to the United States Constitution and the American people to speak forthrightly at this very late hour.</blockquote><p>The evidence is that Powell is unfortunately well on his way to sealing the Federal Reserve’s fate.</p><p>Powell already made the critical error of “hanging separately” from the rest of the administrative state. The news this week of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/cdc-leaders-quit-susan-monarez-firing?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>attempted firing of the head of the Center for Disease Control</u></a> emphasizes that there are areas more important than central banking where non-partisan expertise needs insulation from short term partisan political interference. He seems to have made the choice for each governor of the Federal Reserve to now hang separately from each other. Powell will, in turn, hang both separately and alone.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Take out a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>Unless, of course, he makes the decision to stand up for the rule of law and explain that the attack is not merely on the central bank, but democracy and the constitution. Powell should give a public, primetime television speech explaining the stakes, that the president’s order was legally invalid and that the Federal Reserve system will ignore the order. Federal Reserve Board General Counsel Mark Van Der Weide and the legal division of the Federal Reserve Board are no doubt advising Powell that any such bold action would open Powell up to the risk of a “for cause” firing from Trump himself. Their legal analysis is sound but their political instincts are wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>When your opponent is Donald Trump you escalate in response to threats; you don’t try to appease him. Powell must do everything in his power to compel the conventional wisdom of market traders to more adequately “price in” the degradation of the rule of law. This must include tying the rule of law and the threats to the constitution to the credibility and standing of the Federal Reserve itself. Powell’s term expires in less than a year anyway. If defending the constitution and his own institution is not worth the risk, what would be? The Federal Reserve has already made the error of letting itself become isolated from the attacks on the rest of the administrative state. Powell can still change course, but time is running out.

Apparently I had my finger on the pulse of events. \n\nMy Op Ed develops the ideas I’ve been developing the past six months regarding exchange traded markets as “conventional wisdom processors” rather than “information processors” as a certain influential school of thought has claimed with increasing success over the past half century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn’t get to focus on Governor Lisa Cook but I do want to say a little bit about this. Lisa Cook is the first Black woman ever appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. She is only the fourth Black person ever to be appointed. Trump certainly has a disdain for Federal Reserve independence. However, he also has been purging Black people from government and it would be a mistake to think racism does not play a major role in how Lisa Cook has been targeted. I know for many readers this is a boring, uninteresting or even “ideological” point. In my view it is a fact and I think it is long past time to push through the discomfort or disdain that many people have about talking about racism and race in everyday politics. At the most basic level, you will not understand what’s going on without it. The attack on “DEI” is part of the restructuring of our government around Trump’s personal agenda.\n\nLisa Cook deserves better and it will be shameful at many different levels if Chairman Powell does not come out swinging in defense of her. Onto the Op Ed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Markets Aren’t Freaking Out Over Trump’s Attack on the Fed And why that’s a big mistake.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s campaign to dominate the Federal Reserve reached new heights with his effort to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook — and Wall Street responded with a yawn. The tepid reaction from markets is perhaps shocking, but it’s not surprising.\n\nThe second Trump administration has been consumed by two central themes. The first theme is the unprecedented pace at which this administration has attacked the rule of law and the constitutional system on which it is built. The second theme is the unprecedented weakness of the response from major institutions to the Trump administration’s actions. Wall Street’s passivity amid Trump’s unprecedented attack on the Fed is only the latest example.\n\nTo economists, the independence of the Federal Reserve is particularly sacrosanct. They think absolute independence from the president and Congress is the best result for the economy in the long term. Trump, on the other hand, views an independent Fed as his enemy; for months, he’s been browbeating Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates in order to boost the economy, despite Powell’s public views that so far, the time hasn’t been right. Trump sees the world as a real estate developer first, and to real estate developers, lower interest rates are like manna from heaven.\n\nThroughout Trump’s campaign targeting the Fed, investors have remained remarkably calm, even now.

I have continued to work full time on Notes on the Crises but the work of setting up a physical office takes significant time and energy. Among other things, I have secured a fiscal sponsor so I could take 501(c)3 donations, and continue to pursue investigative work which is taking time and effort to gestate. One small project I can publicly reveal is that, with the help of the yeowoman’s efforts of John Jay student Josie-Grace Valerius I can say that the Notes on the Crises Youtube channel is now hosting the obscure and previously inaccessible recordings of public meetings of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. I thought it was important to preserve these videos with the recent threats to FSOC.\n\nThere are other projects I have been working on as well that I am not quite ready to publicly reveal-including frankly, some unexpected but typical delays. Readers will be hearing more about all of these developments-and more- very soon. Finally, frankly, after the first five months covering Trump I also needed to slow down to prevent burnout. Now that I've worked through a large backlog of administrative tasks and project gestation, I can refocus on writing.\n\nHowever, rather than picking up some of the threads of my coverage going into the summer, I need to cover the monumental developments over the intensifying conflict between Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. In certain respects it is strange how little I’ve written about the Federal Reserve. Right up until my January 31st piece on impoundment, the Federal Reserve was the focus of almost all my writing at Notes on the Crises. I spent the last year and a half of the Biden administration intensively doing archival research related to the Federal Reserve, while issuing hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests targeting the Federal Reserve. \n\nIn fact, I issued so many FOIA requests over that period of time that the 2025 FOIA report obliquely referenced my FOIA requests to explain the increase of its backlog;\n\nIn addition, approximately twenty-two percent of the incoming requests involved complex information from five news media requesters pertaining to Board members' communications and meetings with members of the executive branch as well as various memoranda concerning a Federal Reserve System publication. [emphasis added]\n\nThose “various memoranda” were memos mentioned in the 30,000 page 1967-1973 Federal Reserve Board Minutes which I successfully acquired through FOIA last year (which are now searchable and freely available on this website). That’s without even mentioning auctioning off a book proposal about the Federal Reserve entitled Picking Losers in April 2023. \n\nSo if I’m obsessed with the Federal Reserve, why haven’t I been writing about it? Well in large part it's because I was so busy, and I found it challenging to gather all of my complicated thoughts about the Federal Reserve at this moment. Another reason is that I simply thought the other aspects of the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis mattered much more. At this point, however, I would be shirking my responsibility as a Federal Reserve expert not to comment on the situation. So here goes…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake out a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait, What’s Going On?\n\nSome readers may not really have clocked the burgeoning conflict between Trump and Powell. The bottom line is that President Trump has long criticized Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell for either raising interest rates or not lowering them. \n\nIn this respect Trump is straightforwardly bringing his intuitions from his time as a real estate developer. Real estate is an incredibly leveraged industry where relatively small variations in interest rates can raise a project’s average total costs dramatically. As no less than economist Hyman Minsky pointed out in 1990:\n\nTwo factors made Trump somewhat unique--one was that he developed a fortune in a period of high real interest rates, and the second was that the cash flows on most of Trump's properties were negative. [...] Trump was golden--he had the magic touch– as long as property prices were increasing at a more rapid rate than the interest rate on the borrowed funds. [...] In the short run Trump could make his interest payments with funds from new loans– but when the increase in property prices declined to a value below the interest rate, Trump would become short of the cash necessary to pay the interest on the outstanding loans\n\nIn this commentary Minsky anticipates Trump’s bankruptcies- and perhaps even his October 1990 default to lenders; although it is not one of his, shall we say, more impressive predictions. The point is, Trump is a man who might never have gone bankrupt at all if the Federal Reserve had cut interest rates in 1990- or raised them in 1988 and 1989. The best way to understand him is to see these moments as permanently imprinted on his consciousness.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has, of course, not been cooperating. This is both because of its views of the general macroeconomic picture and, specifically, the impact of Trump’s erratic tariff policies. Thus, inevitably, the attacks began. Trump spent the summer going back and forth over whether he was going to fire Powell, ultimately backing off- at least for now. A major part of the Trump Administration’s attack was over Federal Reserve Board building renovations and cost overruns. This led to a comic scene of Trump and Powell wearing hard hats walking through a construction site and arguing over budget numbers on a piece of paper. The point is, the pressure is clearly very much on.\n\nJust this Wednesday, a new attack emerged- this time targeting Fed governor Lisa Cook- the first Black woman (or woman of color for that matter) appointed to the Federal Reserve Board. The head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency is apparently accusing her of committing “mortgage fraud” in 2021. She has explicitly told the press that she will “not be bullied”. Trump clearly intends to bend the Federal Reserve to his will, just like he has done- or has been attempting- with every other administrative agency.\n\n\nFederal Reserve Independence is An Ideology, Not a Legal Arrangement\n\nWhich brings us to “central bank independence”. The phrase “central bank independence” gets thrown around so much that I think many readers believe that this is a reference to some statute or law. Failing that, it might seem to have a particular or precise meaning. In fact, this idea is not encoded anywhere in U.S. law. Even in places where some form of “central bank independence” is legally encoded, the ideology came well before the legal niceties. As I wrote about in my 2021 piece (that I only belatedly published earlier this year), this ideology is a crude and amateurish attempt to cover some of the core issues debated in administrative law. This is important for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, let's have a little refresher on the basics of “law”. The term “laws” is imprecise. Typically, when we think of “laws” we think of bills passed by congress. They are, as the phrase goes, “signed into law”. Passed bills are known as “statutes”. Yet, an executive order also has the “force of law”. A constitution- specifically the United States constitution- is supposed to stand above all of these. An unconstitutional statute, even if it's passed by congress and signed by the president, is overruled by the constitution itself. At least, that’s notionally how it's “supposed” to work.\n\nThen there are court decisions. Court decisions which overturn precedent are sometimes described as “reinterpreting” law. However, another way of thinking about this- which I think is more useful for people who aren’t invested in the ins and outs of the legal system- is that Courts create law. Roe v. Wade made abortion legal nationwide when it was not before.  Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in turn made it legal for states to overtly criminalize abortion. These were forms of legal creation and destruction. Now, of course, courts are “supposed” to constrain their legal creation and destruction to the ambiguities and contradictions between constitutional provisions, congressional statutes, executive orders and administrative agency guidances etc. The “symbolism” of interpretation is where courts are supposed to derive their legitimacy and ultimately, other bodies of law “should” dominate; Emphasis on should. \n\nToday, of course, it is plain that if this was ever true- it is not true today. The Supreme Court blatantly places Trump administration executive orders above statutory and constitutional provisions. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Jackson aptly summarized the current situation in a dissenting decision just yesterday: “This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.” This situation is, of course, what I’ve been fixated on from even before I became aware of the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis. As I wrote in my impoundment piece on January 31st “As a famous twentieth century statesman might have said in this situation ‘...and how many divisions does the Constitution have?’” Legitimacy is being treated as a sucker’s game and as long as no major institution responds, isn’t it a sucker’s game? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Notes on the Crises!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis “view of law from space” might seem far afield of our topic today, but it is not. It's important to have the big picture in mind because it helps us clarify what concretely protects the Federal Reserve’s “independence”. The founding moment of Federal Reserve independence known as the “Fed-Treasury Accord” happened in March 1951. Note the phrasing: “accord”. It was not a law, it wasn’t even an administrative guidance. It was a terse press release from two government agencies. In other words it's not law- it's a norm. And, as we all know, norms are not long for this world under Donald Trump. The fundamental legal basis for the Fed’s so-called independence was created not in 1951 but in 1935. \n\nSince February 2024 I have, again and again, gone back to the 7 monographs written by one of the most important General Counsels of the Federal Reserve Board- Howard Hackley- which I got from the Federal Reserve through FOIA in discussing the Fed’s legal structure. The most important monograph- “The Status Of The Federal Reserve System In The Federal Government”- is the most comprehensive publicly available legal treatise on the Federal Reserve’s independence- or lack thereof- within the Federal Government.  This book makes plain that the Federal Reserve’s independence rests on two foundations- that it is not subject to the appropriations process in determining its budget and the legal protections its leadership has against removal. The question of firing Powell- or any other member of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee- is a matter of the latter.\n\n\nPowell’s Executor\n\nThose protections against removal come from the Banking Act of 1935- which, by happenstance, was signed into law by FDR 90 years ago tomorrow. They built on a supreme court decision which had come just three months beforehand called Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. As I wrote about all the way back in February, this case ruled that FDR’s firing of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioner was unconstitutional. Its protections were clearly built atop that recent case. This means that there are no special statutory or constitutional protections for the Federal Reserve’s discretion relative to the President. It has the protection that any other independent administrative agency has- or doesn’t have.\n\nWhich brings us to the fact that Humphrey’s Executor was struck down by the current supreme court mere days before its 90th anniversary. This is, of course, the holy grail of right wing proponents of “Unitary Executive Theory” i.e. the idea that all “executive power” is under the president’s direct control. A February 18th “Fact Sheet” from the White House summarizing the executive order “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies” neatly summarizes this “theory”:\n\nTherefore, because all executive power is vested in the President, all agencies must: (1) submit draft regulations for White House review—with no carve-out for so-called independent agencies and (2) consult with the White House on their priorities and strategic plans, and the White House will set their performance standards\n\nThe category of “independent agency” is thus, in the view of the Trump administration and the Supreme Court, dead. \n\nWell, the above is a little misleading because I cut a crucial part of the “fact sheet” out. It does give an exception to its sweeping “no carve-out” position. The fact sheet, following the executive order itself, says “except for the monetary policy functions of the Federal Reserve;” [emphasis added]. This exception is, of course, completely ad-hoc. It should not be comforting to even the narrowest supporter of “central bank independence”. Yet the “conventional wisdom processor” on Wall Street did not react with alarm to this executive order the way it should have.\n\nThe Supreme Court itself took this ad-hoc exemption and ran with it. It made up an absurd and patently false legislative history for the Federal Reserve system in Trump v. Wilcox:\n\nFinally, respondents Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris contend that arguments in this case necessarily implicate the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections for members of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or other members of the Federal Open Market Committee. [...] We disagree. The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States [emphasis added]\n\nThis is simply not true. As Columbia law professor Lev Menand says in a quickly written takedown of this claim:\n\nBut the Federal Reserve Board and the FOMC are not banks, nor are they corporations, nor are they lending new money to households and businesses like the national banks (antebellum and postbellum). The Federal Reserve Board and the FOMC are government agencies designed to regulate banks\n\nThe dissenting Supreme Court justices also note this bizarre Federal Reserve carveout. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Notes on the Crises!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Elena Kagan states in her dissent:\n\nThe majority closes today’s order by stating, out of the blue, that it has no bearing on “the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections” for members of the Federal Reserve Board or Open Market Committee. Ante, at 2. I am glad to hear it, and do not doubt the majority’s intention to avoid imperiling the Fed. But then, today’s order poses a puzzle. For the Federal Reserve’s independence rests on the same constitutional and analytic foundations as that of the NLRB, MSPB, FTC, FCC, and so on—which is to say it rests largely on Humphrey’s. [...]\n\nBecause one way of making new law on the emergency docket (the deprecation of Humphrey’s) turns out to require yet another (the creation of a bespoke Federal Reserve exception). If the idea is to reassure the markets, a simpler—and more judicial—approach would have been to deny the President’s application for a stay on the continued authority of Humphrey’s\n\nThis “bespoke” Federal Reserve exemption is one reason that Trump’s attack focuses on building renovations- i.e. Federal Reserve fiscal policy. \n\nThe Fed may be independent in its “monetary functions”, whatever that is, but that implies presidential supremacy on “non-monetary” matters. The Federal Reserve itself has taken on this kind of interpretation which is why it left the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) before Trump was even inaugurated and Michael Barr stepped down as vice chair for supervision. It's hard to see why direct control of financial regulation by the president is less “dangerous” than interest rate policy and/or financial asset purchase and sale policy.\n\nOf course, the “Federal Reserve” exception will hold only as long as it is of use to the president. Powell may boldly say that firing him is “not permitted under the law” but, absent radical and bold action on his part, the battle over whether Trump can just fire him was lost when Humphrey’s Executor died in May.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Notes on the Crises!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Unitary Executive is Not a Solution to the Problems with Monetary Policy\n\nSome progressive commentators are embracing presidential supremacy over monetary policy as an outlet for “Democracy”. This has been something I’ve opposed for years. My 2021 commentary on this issue I think holds up quite well:\n\nWhile in some respects attractive, the self-styled populist perspective is a trap. By accepting the premise that monetary policy is only democratic if interest rates and credit policy decisions are directly set by legislatures or heads of state, outside critics help reinforce the choice of economists to conflate anti-democratic preferences, with issues of administrative action, and careful deliberation. In the post-Trump world, it is easy to casually dismiss such suggestions as dangerous and defend central bank independence as a kind of “lesser evil” to those who are not deeply invested in the issue. Professor Skinner’s beginning submission to this roundtable is a strong recounting of this “lesser evil” case.\n\nWe do not have to accept this dichotomy. Rejecting central bank independence doesn’t have to mean rejecting administrative discretion, or some degree of independence from short-term political considerations heads of states and legislatures face. Conversely, arguing for “democratizing” central banking doesn’t necessarily mean more legislative or executive determination of the day to day — or even year to year — decisions. Once we learn to ignore this false dichotomy, we can start to imagine a variety of administrative structures which provide ordinary people the ability to provide meaningful input into these decisions. [emphasis added]\n\nUnitary Executive Theory was on my mind when I wrote those words and the second Trump administration has illustrated my point in spades. We are in a constitutional crisis where the centralization of power under direct control of the president and the disempowerment of independent administrative agencies, congress and the courts is moving forward at a truly breathtaking pace. It's farcical to see yet more Trump capriciousness as a victory for “democracy”.\n\nI have so much more to say on this topic. I want to comment on the fascinating episode between Trump and Powell over Federal Reserve renovations more. I want to comment on the interaction between interest rate policy and government interest payments. I want to unpack whether direct control over monetary policy would even accomplish what Trump would hope to accomplish. But this piece is already very long and we need to see what Chairman Powell will say at Jackson Hole today. I’m very much looking forward to it.","html":"\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive kg-cta-no-dividers   kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Support Notes on the Crises!\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>Hello readers; I’m long overdue for major updates across a whole range of issues.

So here goes…</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive kg-cta-no-dividers   kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Take out a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<h2 id=\"wait-what%E2%80%99s-going-on\"><strong>Wait, What’s Going On?</strong></h2><p>Some readers may not really have clocked the burgeoning conflict between Trump and Powell. The bottom line is that President Trump has long criticized Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell for either raising interest rates or not lowering them.&nbsp;</p><p>In this respect Trump is straightforwardly bringing his intuitions from his time as a real estate developer. Real estate is an incredibly leveraged industry where relatively small variations in interest rates can raise a project’s average total costs dramatically. As no less than economist Hyman Minsky pointed <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1093&context=hm_archive&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>out in 1990</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Two factors made Trump somewhat unique--one was that he developed a fortune in a period of high real interest rates, and the second was that the cash flows on most of Trump's properties were negative. [...] Trump was golden--he had the magic touch– as long as property prices were increasing at a more rapid rate than the interest rate on the borrowed funds. [...] In the short run Trump could make his interest payments with funds from new loans– but when the increase in property prices declined to a value below the interest rate, Trump would become short of the cash necessary to pay the interest on the outstanding loans</blockquote><p>In this commentary Minsky anticipates Trump’s bankruptcies- and perhaps even his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-fact-checking-and-analysis-of-the-first-presidential-debate/fact-check-has-trump-declared-bankruptcy-four-or-six-times/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>October 1990 default to lenders</u></a>; although it is not one of his, shall we say, more impressive predictions. The point is, Trump is a man who might never have gone bankrupt at all if the Federal Reserve had cut interest rates in 1990- or raised them in 1988 and 1989. The best way to understand him is to see these moments as permanently imprinted on his consciousness.</p><p>The Federal Reserve has, of course, not been cooperating. This is both because of its views of the general macroeconomic picture and, specifically, the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20250730.pdf\"><u>impact of Trump’s erratic tariff policies</u></a>. Thus, inevitably, the attacks began. Trump spent the summer going back and forth over whether he was going to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/22/trump-backs-away-from-firing-powell-hes-going-to-be-out-pretty-soon-anyway.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>fire Powell</u></a>, ultimately backing off- at least for now. A major part of the Trump Administration’s attack was over Federal Reserve Board building renovations and cost overruns. This led to a comic scene of Trump and Powell <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/24/politics/video/president-trump-jerome-powell-renovation-exchange-digvid?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>wearing hard hats walking through a construction site</u></a> and arguing over budget numbers on a piece of paper. The point is, the pressure is clearly very much on.</p><p>Just this Wednesday, a new attack emerged- this time targeting Fed governor Lisa Cook- the first Black woman (or woman of color for that matter) appointed to the Federal Reserve Board. The head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency is apparently accusing her of committing <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/economy/trump-pushes-for-fed-governor-lisa-cook-resignation?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“mortgage fraud” in 2021</u></a>. She has explicitly told the press that she will <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/20/economy/trump-pushes-for-fed-governor-lisa-cook-resignation?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“not be bullied”</u></a>. Trump clearly intends to bend the Federal Reserve to his will, just like he has done- or has been attempting- with every other administrative agency.</p><h2 id=\"federal-reserve-independence-is-an-ideology-not-a-legal-arrangement\"><strong>Federal Reserve Independence is An Ideology, Not a Legal Arrangement</strong></h2><p>Which brings us to “central bank independence”. The phrase “central bank independence” gets thrown around so much that I think many readers believe that this is a reference to some statute or law. Failing that, it might seem to have a particular or precise meaning. In fact, this idea is <strong>not encoded anywhere</strong> in U.S. law. Even in places where some form of “central bank independence” is legally encoded, the ideology came well before the legal niceties. As I wrote about in my 2021 piece (that I only <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/just-another-administrative-agency-preserving-central-bank-discretion-without-illusions/\"><u>belatedly published earlier this year</u></a>), this ideology is a crude and amateurish attempt to cover some of the core issues debated in administrative law. This is important for a few reasons.</p><p>First, let's have a little refresher on the basics of “law”. The term “laws” is imprecise. Typically, when we think of “laws” we think of bills passed by congress. They are, as the phrase goes, “signed into law”. Passed bills are known as “statutes”. Yet, an executive order also has the “force of law”. A constitution- specifically the United States constitution- is supposed to stand above all of these. An unconstitutional statute, even if it's passed by congress and signed by the president, is overruled by the constitution itself. At least, that’s notionally how it's “supposed” to work.</p><p>Then there are court decisions. Court decisions which overturn precedent are sometimes described as “reinterpreting” law. However, another way of thinking about this- which I think is more useful for people who aren’t invested in the ins and outs of the legal system- is that Courts <em>create</em> <em>law</em>. Roe v. Wade made abortion legal nationwide when it was not before. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization</u></a> in turn made it legal for states to overtly criminalize abortion. These were forms of legal creation and destruction. Now, of course, courts are “supposed” to constrain their legal creation and destruction to the ambiguities and contradictions between constitutional provisions, congressional statutes, executive orders and administrative agency guidances etc. The “symbolism” of interpretation is where courts are supposed to derive their legitimacy and ultimately, other bodies of law “should” dominate; Emphasis on <strong>should</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, of course, it is plain that if this was ever true- it is not true today. The Supreme Court blatantly places Trump administration executive orders above statutory and constitutional provisions. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Jackson aptly summarized the current situation in a dissenting decision <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a103_kh7p.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>just yesterday</u></a>: “<em>This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules</em>. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.” This situation is, of course, what I’ve been fixated on from even before I became aware of the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis. As I wrote in <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>my impoundment piece on January 31st</u></a> “As a famous twentieth century statesman might have said in this situation ‘...and how many divisions does the Constitution have?’” Legitimacy is being treated as a sucker’s game and as long as no major institution responds, isn’t it a sucker’s game?&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive kg-cta-no-dividers   kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Support Notes on the Crises!\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>This “view of law from space” might seem far afield of our topic today, but it is not. It's important to have the big picture in mind because it helps us clarify what concretely protects the Federal Reserve’s “independence”. The founding moment of Federal Reserve independence known as the <a href=\"https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2001/winter/leachhetzel?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“Fed-Treasury Accord”</u></a> happened in March 1951. Note the phrasing: “accord”. It was not a law, it wasn’t even an administrative guidance. It was a terse press release from two government agencies. In other words it's not law- it's a <em>norm</em>. And, as we all know, norms are not long for this world under Donald Trump. The fundamental legal basis for the Fed’s so-called independence was created not in 1951 but in 1935.&nbsp;</p><p>Since February 2024 I have, again and again, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/revealed-the-seven-secret-federal-reserve-books-i-won-through-foia/\"><u>gone back to the 7 monographs</u></a> written by one of the most important General Counsels of the Federal Reserve Board- Howard Hackley- which I got from the Federal Reserve through FOIA in discussing the Fed’s legal structure. The most important monograph- <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2023/12/Hackley-1972.-The-Status-of-the-Federal-Reserve-System-in-the-Federal-Government.pdf\"><u>“The Status Of The Federal Reserve System In The Federal Government”</u></a>- is the most comprehensive publicly available legal treatise on the Federal Reserve’s independence- or lack thereof- within the Federal Government.&nbsp; This book makes plain that the Federal Reserve’s independence rests on two foundations- that it is not subject to the appropriations process in determining its budget and the legal protections its leadership has against removal. The question of firing Powell- or any other member of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee- is a matter of the latter. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdK3BOR_i6VenVg4-E6t7QKQhpRG53iRT24EE-WfhgBEc9lSbbdvXZ-T5youbgN3wVAX5lD-fC82r8chozTw-qq5OqRj6N3LHD6AoTN0Or-bnONzoXo95601i-hbABv21AhbR2x?key=7TIkr0Jw8bk7VR4zakFR2w\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"372\"></figure><h2 id=\"powell%E2%80%99s-executor\"><strong>Powell’s<em> </em>Executor</strong></h2><p>Those protections against removal come from the Banking Act of 1935- which, by happenstance, was signed into law by <a href=\"https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/banking-act-1935-983?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>FDR 90 years ago tomorrow</u></a>. They built on a supreme court decision which had come just three months beforehand called <em>Humphrey’s Executor v. United States</em>. As I wrote about <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-should-we-care-if-the-trump-administration-and-musks-doge-are-acting-unconstitutionally/\"><u>all the way back in February</u></a>, this case ruled that FDR’s firing of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioner was unconstitutional. Its protections were clearly built atop that recent case. This means that there are no special statutory or constitutional protections for the Federal Reserve’s discretion relative to the President. It has the protection that any other independent administrative agency has- or doesn’t have.</p><p>Which brings us to the fact that<em> Humphrey’s Executor </em>was struck down by the current supreme court mere days before its 90th anniversary. This is, of course, the holy grail of right wing proponents of <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-should-we-care-if-the-trump-administration-and-musks-doge-are-acting-unconstitutionally/\"><u>“Unitary Executive Theory” i.e. the idea that all “executive power”</u></a> is under the president’s direct control. A <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-reins-in-independent-agencies-to-restore-a-government-that-answers-to-the-american-people/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>February 18th “Fact Sheet” from the White House</u></a> summarizing the executive order “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies” neatly summarizes this “theory”:</p><blockquote>Therefore, because all executive power is vested in the President, all agencies must: (1) submit draft regulations for White House review—with no carve-out for so-called independent agencies and (2) consult with the White House on their priorities and strategic plans, and the White House will set their performance standards</blockquote><p>The category of “independent agency” is thus, in the view of the Trump administration and the Supreme Court, dead.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, the above is a little misleading because I cut a crucial part of the “fact sheet” out. It does give an exception to its sweeping “no carve-out” position. The fact sheet, following the executive order itself, says “<strong>except</strong> <strong>for</strong> the monetary policy functions of the Federal Reserve;” [emphasis added]. This exception is, of course, completely ad-hoc. It should not be comforting to even the narrowest supporter of “central bank independence”. Yet the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>“conventional wisdom processor”</u></a> on Wall Street did not react with alarm to this executive order the way it should have.</p><p>The Supreme Court itself took this ad-hoc exemption and ran with it. It made up an absurd and patently false legislative history for the Federal Reserve system <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a966_1b8e.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>in <em>Trump v. Wilcox:</em></u></a></p><blockquote>Finally, respondents Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris contend that arguments in this case necessarily implicate the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections for members of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or other members of the Federal Open Market Committee. [...] We disagree. The Federal Reserve is a <strong>uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States</strong> [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>This is simply not true. As Columbia law professor Lev Menand says in a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/08/Menand-2025.-The-Federal-Reserve-Board-and-the-FOMC-are-Government-Regulators-Not-Banks-A-Reply-to-Baude--Bamzai--and-Nielson.pdf\"><u>quickly written takedown of this claim</u></a>:</p><blockquote>But the Federal Reserve Board and the FOMC are not banks, nor are they corporations, nor are they lending new money to households and businesses like the national banks (antebellum and postbellum).

The Federal Reserve itself has taken on this kind of interpretation which is why it left the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) before <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/federal-reserve-announces-exit-regulatory-climate-change-group-2025-01-17/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Trump was even inaugurated </u></a>and Michael Barr stepped down as <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20250106a.htm\"><u>vice chair for supervision</u></a>. It's hard to see why direct control of financial regulation by the president is less “dangerous” than interest rate policy and/or financial asset purchase and sale policy.</p><p>Of course, the “Federal Reserve” exception will hold only as long as it is of use to the president. Powell may boldly say that firing him is <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20241107.pdf\"><u>“not permitted under the law”</u></a> but, absent radical and bold action on his part, the battle over whether Trump can just fire him was lost when <em>Humphrey’s Executor</em> died in May.</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-none kg-cta-immersive kg-cta-no-dividers   kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Support Notes on the Crises!\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<h2 id=\"the-unitary-executive-is-not-a-solution-to-the-problems-with-monetary-policy\"><strong>The Unitary Executive is Not a Solution to the Problems with Monetary Policy</strong></h2><p>Some progressive commentators are embracing presidential supremacy over monetary policy as an outlet for “Democracy”. This has been something I’ve opposed for years. My 2021 commentary on this issue I think holds up quite well:</p><blockquote>While in some respects attractive, the self-styled populist perspective is a trap. By accepting the premise that monetary policy is only democratic if interest rates and credit policy decisions are directly set by legislatures or heads of state, outside critics help reinforce the choice of economists to conflate anti-democratic preferences, with issues of administrative action, and careful deliberation. <strong>In the post-Trump world</strong>, it is easy to casually dismiss such suggestions as dangerous and defend central bank independence as a kind of “lesser evil” to those who are not deeply invested in the issue. <a href=\"https://justmoney.org/c-skinner-independence-executive-pressure-and-central-bank-activism/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Professor Skinner’s beginning submission to this roundtable</u></a> is a strong recounting of this “lesser evil” case.</blockquote><blockquote>We do not have to accept this dichotomy. Rejecting central bank independence d<strong>oesn’t have to mean rejecting administrative discretion, or some degree of independence from short-term political considerations heads of states and legislatures face</strong>. Conversely, arguing for “democratizing” central banking doesn’t necessarily mean more legislative or executive determination of the day to day — or even year to year — decisions. Once we learn to ignore this false dichotomy, we can start to imagine a variety of administrative structures which provide ordinary people the ability to provide meaningful input into these decisions. [emphasis added]</blockquote><p>Unitary Executive Theory was on my mind when I wrote those words and the second Trump administration has illustrated my point in spades. We are in a constitutional crisis where the centralization of power under direct control of the president and the disempowerment of independent administrative agencies, congress and the courts is moving forward at a truly breathtaking pace. It's farcical to see yet more Trump capriciousness as a victory for “democracy”.</p><p>I have so much more to say on this topic. I want to comment on the fascinating episode between Trump and Powell over Federal Reserve renovations more. I want to comment on the interaction between interest rate policy and government interest payments. I want to unpack whether direct control over monetary policy would even accomplish what Trump would hope to accomplish. But this piece is already very long and we need to see what Chairman Powell will say at Jackson Hole today.

One episode that I thought was particularly important was their April 30th episode with former BLS Commissioner Bill Beach. \n\nGiven recent events, this topic has become especially important. On Friday, in response to a “bad” Jobs report and a consequential data revision, President Trump fired the current head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As the discussion below will illustrate, the granular price and product quality data that indices like the Consumer Price Index are based on is collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Indeed, they are responsible for turning “micro-price data”, sometimes referred to as “Micro-CPI data” into the commonly used price indices that most people think of as “inflation”. The controversy over this typically sleepy area of economic policy is going to explode now that its in Trump’s crosshairs.\n\nThank you to Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway for permission to publish this. Thank you to Rabia Raziq, a college intern with Notes on the Crises for cleaning up the raw transcript.\n\nSometime this week I will have an article catching up on everything that has been happening on the Federal Reserve along with a more general update on what's been going on at Notes on the Crises this summer. \n\nRabia Raziq is a senior at John Jay studying Political Science and Economics, with hands-on experience at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, New York State Senate & Supreme Court. She is currently exploring topics at the intersection of national security and international economics at Notes on the Crises.\n\n\n\n\nSome of America’s Most Important Economic Data Is Decaying: A former head of the BLS on why gathering official statistics is getting harder\n\n\n\nJoe Weisenthal (01:14): Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.\n\nTracy Alloway (01:19): And I'm Tracy Alloway.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (01:20): Tracy, I've said this a bunch of times, and we've sort of danced around this issue on the podcast before, but I've said this a bunch of times. I'm sort of fascinated by the degree to which we sort of take numbers on the screen for granted. Like, you know we look at a price of a stock and it exists on the screen. It's like, where did that come from? How did that get there? Or like the first Friday of the month, the jobs data flashes on the screen and we just start talking about what the data said, what the unemployment rate was, et cetera. But we don't really talk enough about what had to happen behind the scenes to get that number to the screen.\n\nTracy Alloway (01:54): Right, I find this really interesting as well because obviously there's the data collection portion of this like—\n\nJoe Weisenthal: Yeah.\n\nTracy Alloway (02:01): You have to go out and talk to people for certain surveys, certain data points, but also there are so many qualitative and subjective adjustments that you can make to that data. So for instance, with CPI, I didn't know that CPI weightings are like different depending on what city you're in. [Joe: Oh, interesting.] So for instance, food at home could matter a lot more in, I don't know, Minneapolis compared to Chicago. It's really interesting and there's also qualitative adjustments, so if your fridge gets WiFi connectivity, then that gets incorporated into the price as well. So it's really interesting.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (02:38): It's super interesting and this is the issue. We don't talk about data collection, but it's obviously some of the most interesting stuff there is because of course things like food at home in one city should be different than another city if you really want to collect a basket. So it means that what you have is some of the most interesting economics work being done anywhere in a realm that virtually gets no attention. When we talk about data collection, you hear it a lot in politics, surveys have gotten, no one answers the phone, it's harder and harder to do high quality surveys. I think you've written about this response rates and just the actual cost of collection of all this data is on the rise.\n\nTracy Alloway (03:20): So I have a bunch of thoughts on this. I'll just say talking about the economic data might be timely as well because we know that Trump doesn't really respect, I guess a lot of official economic data and he's also trying to cut back on costs or funding of a bunch of different government programs. So it's clear that entities like the Bureau of Labor Statistics could potentially be in the crosshairs here. But you're right, response rates, lower response rates have been happening for a long time and it's really easy to look up just how bad things have gotten. If you look at the BLS website for instance, look at response rates on the housing portion of CPI, that's gone from about 70% back in 2015 to just 57% now.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (04:09): Wow.\n\nTracy Alloway (04:10): Response rates on JOLTS have gone from I think 67% to just 30%. So that's pretty amazing and the other interesting thing here is it's not just a U.S. problem. There's no U.S. exceptionalism here. You see the same pattern in other economies like the UK and New Zealand and actually in the UK just last month the Office of National Statistics said it wasn't going to publish PPI because of a data quality issue and also trade data had a problem because of errors in the data provided by revenue and customs. And now there's a task force to look at all of these mistakes and data problems that the ONS has, so something that goes beyond the U.S. here.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (04:52): This is a really big deal, especially when you just consider how much economic activity is based on being able to look at high quality data and make decisions from it, obviously in the market, but also in just sort of the quote, real economy, et cetera. Anyway, without further ado, we really do have the perfect guest, someone who knows a lot about how the sausage is made and why making the sausage is getting more expensive. We are going to be speaking to Bill Beach. He was most recently the commissioner of the BLS and he knows all about this. He was the 15th commissioner at the BLS, does research affiliated with the Economic Policy Innovation Center, and he's going to talk to us about all of these issues. Bill, thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots.\n\nBill Beach (05:37): Man, it is great to be with you and Tracy, thank you very much. It's a great topic right now.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (05:42): It's a great topic. I don't know when the process begins, but it's like I get this number. It says what the jobs report, it says how many jobs were created that month. How did that number get onto my screen or onto bls.gov?\n\nBill Beach (05:57): It gets there every month—\n\nJoe Weisenthal (06:00): Yeah, every month. Every month, it is never missed except maybe once in a hurricane or something. Anyway, how did it get there?\n\nBill Beach (06:05): Yeah, the first Friday report, the jobs report, which comes out at 8:30 EST on the first Friday, it consists of two surveys. So let me talk about the first one, which is the one you just mentioned, the number of jobs. That is a survey of about 400,000 firms out of 11.3 million firms in the United States. About 400,000 of them have agreed voluntarily to send in a pretty complex survey response every month. They send that survey to electronic collection centers. There's one in Chicago, there's one in Atlanta. That survey has to contain the 12th day of the month, if it is a workday or the closest workday to that 12th of November or whatever. And the reason for that is we want to get at least one pay period in the report. So they submit that data, it continues to be collected through almost the end of the month, not quite, but almost the end of the month. It goes from regional offices, these regional collection centers to the national headquarters in Washington where about 40 people, sometimes less, out of the 2,000 people that work there massage the data. This means that they take the data, which is in the survey, it's a sample, it's just a fragment of the total population and they multiply the responses by what are called weights and that gives us the national number.\n\nSo that number is all done pretty much by Tuesday night preceding the Friday and on Wednesday the commissioner gets to hear the data. The commissioner, by the way, plays no role whatsoever in massaging the data or multiplying the survey results times the weights. Then, I would brief the White House. The White House would then brief the Federal Reserve Board chairman, the Secretary of the Treasury on Thursday, that Thursday night usually. They're sworn to secrecy. Then at eight o'clock in the morning I would walk over to the Department of Labor because BLS headquarters is about a 20 minute walk from the Department of Labor. I would brief the Secretary of Labor and for an hour from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM, the Secretary of Labor and his staff had to remain quiet and then at 9:30 AM they could answer questions of the press.\n\nSo, that basically is the process for the jobs report. There's another survey there, interrupt me at any time, but that's where we get the unemployment rates. It's called the household survey. That's a survey of 60,000 households selected out of a sampling frame. We can talk about that term to be representative of the entire United States by demographic segments, how many people are in a certain age group, male, female, the racial and ethnic compositions in geographic locations. So it's a complex sample. That sample is done usually by Monday of the week prior to the release on Friday. And then again, I get to see the results, so the commissioner gets to see the results on Wednesday. So, that's kind of the calendar. Both the household survey and the employment survey cover the same two week period in the month. Now there may be a day or two switch there. Sometimes the household survey has a few more days in it than the establishment survey, but they all target that 12th of the month because we're trying to get the middle of the month. By the way, that's real important because if you have a natural disaster that happens prior to the 12th or after the surveys are closed, that does not affect the results even though you would think since it happened in the month prior that the hurricane might've affected employment results.\n\nTracy (11:30): So one thing you mentioned is companies voluntarily responding to these surveys and one thing I always wondered about is how I guess onerous, or resource intensive is responding to these surveys. So do I have to have a person who's dedicated to doing this every month? Does it consume resources? How long is this going to take me? And then also does the BLS ever try to fact check some of these self-reported data points?\n\nBill Beach (12:03): Those are great questions. So the survey is not just one or two questions. It takes about 30 minutes to fill it out completely. We do get responses that are incomplete and we accept those incomplete responses. The survey is usually filled out by someone who can access the company's data on wages, on total employment, on employment by supervisory or non-supervisory job functions. In other words, it's a person usually in the operations office of a company. Now we ask companies that are very large like the big box retailers all the way down to really small corporations or small firms and it becomes more and more of a difficulty for the smaller firms and we're very cognizant of that. So BLS has reduced the scope of the survey to get it as small as possible and as free of burdensome compliance as possible. It's also an electronic survey so they can fill it out on their computer screens and hit a submit button, which greatly improved our response rate by the way.\n\nSo that survey's not so hard now to fill out though. I think it still takes about 30 minutes, maybe more if you have to dig out the data if you're not in possession of it. The household survey is a totally different beast. It is a long survey. It consists of over 120 questions. It really is hard to fill out if you don't know the terminology. Let me just give you one. We ask the question on employment, are you working or have you looked for work in the past four weeks? That's the key question. We've been asking that question since I think 1943. If they answer I'm working, then they are considered employed. We'll have follow up questions about that, about their industry, about their tasks and so forth. If they say, no, I'm not working, then we say, well, did you look for work in the past four weeks? And they'll say, well, maybe I thought about it. Well, thinking about it's not enough. You can look for one day in the past four weeks and be considered in the labor force but unemployed. So, sometimes we have to have a verbal follow-up rather than they're just filling out a form. There has to be a conversation. That's why we don't do more than 60,000 households because it is burdensome for the person who's the questioner.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (14:36): This leads right into I think what I was about to ask you, which is we're having this conversation April 22, 2025, your term of office at the BLS ended March 2023. So you're actually under both the two recent presidents under the first Trump administration then Biden, but let's say it's March, 2023, how much costlier is that process of communicating with the households than it was say in 2013 or 2003?\n\nBill Beach (15:08): It was more costly certainly, and that's because of inflation and how inflation affected the wage bill for the survey.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (15:16): Okay.\n\nBill Beach (15:18): The survey is taken by the Census Bureau under a contract by BLS, so we pay the Census Bureau to go out in the field and conduct the survey.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (15:27): Okay.\n\nBill Beach (15:29): Here's an idea of how much more expensive it was in 2019, which is the first year of my term. I didn't have to find any additional funding for the household survey. It might've been just small amount, but nothing significant. By 2023, we were having to find almost $4 million, $5 million more. So the cost of the survey—\n\nJoe Weisenthal (15:52): Is that per year, per month?\n\nBill Beach (15:54): That would be for the entire year.\n\nThe cost of the survey went up significantly. Now your listeners will be thinking about the federal budget, which is in the trillions of dollars and say, oh, that's not very much money, but the bureau's budget has not really changed for almost a decade and our costs have gone up progressively. Especially during the period of significant inflation, which we had starting in 2021. So, finding additional money is really hard. During the pandemic, I found millions of dollars of couch money, unused conference fees, unused travel fees, so I could apply that couch money to purposes like beefing up the CPS or building a data—we built a brand-new data center out in the suburb of Washington. But once we were back in business and fully using entire budget, it was very difficult to find those dollars to fill the hole. And I think you could safely say, I've been arguing this now for over two years, our surveys, but especially the current population survey, the one that gives us the unemployment rate, the labor force data are dying, they're decaying, they're in very serious trouble and we will have, unless we modernize that survey, we will see a time when we will be like the British right, unable to publish portions of it that just don't have sufficient sample for statistical release.\n\nTracy Alloway (17:28): Okay, so I'm going to ask the obvious question here, but why have costs of conducting these surveys gathering this data actually gone up? I understand building data centers is probably an expensive process, but on the other hand, going electronic instead of mailing out thousands and thousands of surveys, in theory I would imagine maybe that saves you some money. So what exactly is causing the increase in expenses here?\n\nBill Beach (17:56): The problem is not with the electronic surveys. They will eventually be very cost-effective and there we're suffering from a different problem, which is just public support for the electronic surveys. So the jobs report that is that portion of it that's electronically captured by these collection centers in Chicago and Atlanta. I think those are going along all right for the time being. Our real problem is in the surveys, the data of which is collected by people, survey field survey people, they go out and they talk to the households and there the cost is the obvious one. It is the wage bill. These people are highly skilled interviewers. They're not high school graduates and I have nothing against high school graduates, but they're educated, very trained. Oftentimes economists who will go out and speak to people and do follow-up interviews, my gosh, and they'll spend hours and hours doing this.\n\nWell, okay, fine, that's great, but it costs a lot to keep those people employed. They have other opportunities, so we have to have competitive wages. The wage bill is driving that. Collection costs are a little bit higher. That is the processing costs, but the big part of that is the wage bill and the wage bill is not going to go away. That's just going to continue to go up. So, what we need to do with the household survey, what we have done with the establishment survey, the firm survey, and that is modernize it, so it is more electronically collected and then we also need to integrate data which can be obtained through the internet on households. Households maybe go onto a platform with a tablet or something and supply, maybe we go to a million households and they supply five or six questions and we combine that or blend it with person to person collected data. That's what we call modernization. It may not sound so innovative to your listeners, but it is very innovative for the statistical system. Unless we do that, the cost will continue to rise. The response rates, by the way, are continuing to decline. So that's public support and we be, we just won't have these surveys in the future. It's too expensive.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (20:22): I want to get to the modernization in a second, but just talk to us about, I mean I think you said the survey's dying, which is pretty dramatic given the centrality of this between the response rates, the increased wage bill, et cetera, how severe is this crisis? How much time are we talking about? Because I imagine it gets harder and harder to find that couch change to keep it going.\n\nBill Beach (20:49): Yeah, actually we're out of time. We have to cut down on the sample and I'll give you the evidence. My successor, the current commissioner of labor statistics announced at the end of last year that we would have to reduce the sample in the CPS. That's the household survey by 5,000 households in order to just publish the rest of the sample. Okay, by cutting back on the sample, you cut back on publishing details in the current report, you may not have enough to publish on teenagers anymore, on certain demographic groups. You may not be able to publish details on certain age intervals, like everyone between the ages of 55 and 60 or 65 and 75. Every time you reduce the sample, or your response rate falls, it kind of reduces it for you, we can talk about that. Next, what suffers are the details. Let's go to the CPI, which BLS also does. The CPI is a very big survey, very important survey, but it is oftentimes the case that we don't have details for certain parts of the basket of goods and so we will average across the months and publish for another month based on averages of prior months, but then we run out of the integrity of that average and we can't publish the bread price or something like that.\n\nThat happens more and more because we're getting less and less cooperation by retailers to allow our surveyors into their stores and to go around grabbing the potato chip bag and counting the number of potato chips in the bag. So, we've had to innovate on the CPI on the producer price index, on the import export price indexes. I hope you haven't noticed the innovations because you're not supposed to, but those innovations have saved, absolutely saved the import and export prices. We had response rates down in the 20 percentiles, completely unpublishable detail during the time I was commissioner. We went to using data from the commerce department that is collected by the customs officials and it's working out just great. So we completely left the surveys there. The PPI has problems just like the British are having now, not as bad, and we're using more and more data from private companies who will give us their data from the internet where we collect that data and we combine that with the survey data to keep the things alive on the CPI. It's very interesting. We get all of our retail gas prices now from a private company that aggregates gas prices for the retail gasoline industry and it's a very good source. A lot of our housing prices, now you mentioned housing, we're going to more and more to aggregators, private aggregators. So there are strategies for saving the survey by blending in private data with the survey data. That is not the case with the household survey of the labor force. Nobody really collects that data, except BLS. That's why these demographic surveys census has a bunch of them. Health, the health department, the Department of Health has a lot. They're in very serious trouble.\n\nTracy Alloway (24:24): So I take the point about innovations, but one of the things that's been happening recently is we have been seeing bigger and bigger revisions in a lot of the data. Is that because of the response issue? So more late responses mean that you're going to get revisions later on as those responses are incorporated. And the reason I ask is I remember speaking to someone at the BLS and here, shout out to the people working at the BLS because you can actually just call them and ask questions. They're really, really responsive—amazingly like the only government department that I really know where they'll just pick up the phone and talk to you about methodology. Anyway, I was asking about revisions to PPI for mayonnaise of all things, and the data there had been revised from like 5% to 10%, which is a pretty big change in the space of a couple months. And he was talking about how the PPI is subject to revision up to four months after it's published and it gets updated as new replies come in. So I imagine if response rates are going lower, then maybe that's contributing to some of the revision issue.\n\nBill Beach (25:34): By and large, our issues have to do with response rate. You're absolutely right, and before I go further, I'm very, very happy you said that about BLS because BLS prides itself in being responsive and transparent by the way. So that's a good thing. So I think there are two sources of this problem. The first is really hidden and no one talks about it. So let me just mention when we refresh a survey and you have to do this because people are asked to give their survey responses only for a few months and then they drop out and you have to find new people. The regional offices, there's six of them in the United States for the BLS, they have people who go out and do what's called initiate a new survey respondent. It's getting more and more difficult now to initiate that respondent. People are saying, we just don't have time. Oh my gosh, there's so many important things to do, or we don't want to give you our data because if we give you our data, then the IRS is going to be after us or we're going to have some kind of OSHA. BLS's data is completely protected from the law enforcement aspects of the federal government. It's absolutely only for statistical purposes. That does not prevent people saying, oh, that's going to happen. So if your initiations are dropping and it's harder and harder, no wonder the response rates are dropping because people are less enthusiastic. Even if they say, yeah, I'd love to be a part of it, they're not as enthusiastic as they were a generation ago.\n\nSo the real problem starts at the initiation level and we're seeing that not only in the household survey and in the price area, but we're also seeing that in another survey we haven't talked about, the national compensation survey. It's a wonderful survey on how much people are getting in union houses, union households, and non-union households in Northeast and the Southwest is terrific about that. The JOLTS report, the job openings and labor turnover survey that you mentioned at the opening. Its response rate has fallen dramatically and it's largely because people are less enthusiastic generally about participating in government surveys. It's going to be hard to stem that tide, and I think the only way we can do it is by going to these platform surveys. That is surveys that use the internet as the main platform, integrating a lot of private data and being highly original in the way we think about preparing a statistic for public use. We're just not going to be facing a different world overnight of really happy people wanting to give all their data to the government.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (28:20): It's really a fallen world, I'll say that. They won't let you in the store to look at the price of bread anyway. What would it take to get there? Can this be done unilaterally within the BLS, this sort of big upgrade? Would it need to be something involved with Congress? Would it need a budget allocation that would come from Congress? What would need to happen to get the sort of modernized statistical collection system you would like actually in place?\n\nBill Beach (28:45): I think we have to approach this like we might approach roads and bridges, right? Once Congress becomes aware that there's political liability in ignoring a problem, they generally focus on it until it's fixed. And that was the case with our national highway system, still is the case with our national highway system. We still have a lot of problems. When I go to Congress and I talk about the CPS and response rate, how we're going to lose the unemployment rate, I get immediate response and you know \"communist\", no one's ever said that to me. So, in the last congressional continuing resolution, which was passed few weeks ago, BLS got $6 million more in funding just to fill that hole that we've been talking about on the wage bill. And that was an amazing thing to get in a continuing resolution, an increase in funding.\n\nSo I think Congress presented with a plan or the administration, President Trump is wide open to disruption and change. I think if we develop an aggressive, bold, comprehensive plan about how to rebuild the statistical system so that we're using our resources much more efficiently, perhaps combining some agencies together, instead of having the 24 separate statistical agencies, maybe we ought to have just a handful. And then going from there to a highly innovative different way of collecting and disseminating data, then our roads and bridges, statistically speaking, won't be disintegrating or decaying. We will have new concrete, we'll have new structures, and you can see a future for the statistical system. I think right now speaking as a former director of an agency, one of the most important statistical agencies if not the most important statistical agency in the world, that future looks grim to me. And so change is required. It has to happen, and I think that's what we have to do. Present it with the plan, let Congress see what we're going to do and have them fund modernization, not continuation of the current system.\n\nTracy Alloway (30:48): This is a little out there, but if the problem is the response rates and incentivizing people to actually answer these surveys, could you potentially pay them to do it?\n\nBill Beach (31:00): Tracy, we've tried that. It has been tried a lot. Good suggestion. Yeah, pay them dollars. Okay, tried that didn't make much of a difference. Then we thought, well maybe they'd like to have these cards you can take to retailers and buy anything you want. Right? So we tried that. That's not the issue. I think you could pay people a lot of money, say a thousand dollars a month and they might participate because that's a lot of money, but we can't afford that. That's not out there for the statistical system. So inducements may help at the margin, but they don't change the trend line, which is going negative on the response rate. I think we're going to live with that response rate for a while. I do believe it's generational. I think you can see in the really young kids now, not the ones that are under five, but in the ones that are in their teens kind of a return to doing things together, having more social events, maybe I wouldn't say the bowling leagues are coming back and maybe that's a cultural change that leads to a greater sense of participation and support of public institutions. One could hope.\n\nTracy Alloway (32:17): I like the idea of all the kids coming together to answer surveys from the BLS. That's great.\n\nBill Beach (32:23): I think you'd get some interesting answers there. But yes, short of that, we have to be innovative. We have to change. We have to think outside the box. Otherwise this infrastructure, which we all need, it runs our country. There's no economy without the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the GDP numbers; they don't grow on trees. That's going to be either going to go away or become less reliable.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (34:11): Something that strikes me while listening to you talk and like, oh, you found a way to allocate unused travel spending so that you could keep the surveys going after the wage bill went up, et cetera, I keep rustling for the couch change. And I think about this in you mentioned, okay, well maybe the new president is theoretically open to shaking things up and doing things a different way, which you argue pretty persuasively is necessary. On the other hand, you have the sort of DOGE kick, which is sort of premised on this idea that every agency in the government somehow is just egregiously wasteful. That all of these agencies must be so wasteful that you could cut aggressively and you almost certainly aren't actually going to hit any bone. Seems to be a sort of premise of some of the cutting. It doesn't sound like to me when you described the BLS in 2019 through 2023 that this was an agency that was just you know larded up and plenty of fat that can be trimmed off.\n\nBill Beach (35:14): No fat, no fat at all. But this is the age old conflict, right? Between the entrepreneur and the accountant. The entrepreneur is always looking for innovation and change and higher return on investment and the accountant is always looking for waste and abuse. Are we using our pencils until they're only three inches long? I think that's a fruitful thing. I think you have to have both of those forces working all the time and overtime. Right now, I don't doubt for one second that a lot of the federal could use a thorough scrubbing on the things that DOGE is looking at. The statistical system has unfortunately, in my opinion, but fortunately now been through that scrubbing over the past 15 years. No real increase in budgets and yet an increase in responsibility. So efficiencies have been gained there just from the brutality of living year after year after year with the same dollar amount while your costs are going up while inflation is changing. Don't mind that because efficiencies can occur and we can do more with fewer dollars. That's okay. Innovation on the other hand, has to be kind of funded by your retained earnings and we don't have that in the statistical system. Congress has that, so we're not getting the dollars necessary to innovate and secure the future. That's the problem I want everybody kind of focus on.\n\nTracy Alloway (36:37): So, you mentioned earlier that you had used internet data to try to make up for the lack of a certain data point or a certain response from the surveys. And I'm curious, there is the sense nowadays that everything we do is tracked and recorded somewhere. Could you potentially use some of that type of data instead of voluntarily reported responses?\n\nBill Beach (37:02): So to an extent you can use that if you have an unambiguous signal and you can capture that unambiguous signal month after month, why not capture it? Why not capture, for example, certain pay bands or other things that are happening in the labor force or with wages or with working conditions? The restraint there is that not everything we want to know about the world is unambiguously signaled every month. And I go back to this seemingly easy question, are you working or looking for work? You would be surprised at the number of people who say, I'm working, but then we make that query. Did you work for pay? No. Okay, I did the dishes. Okay, fine. Well, that doesn't see in the mind of the respondent, work is defined differently than it needs to be defined in the statistics. Are you looking for work? Well, yeah, I'm looking for work. When did you look for work? Last year. Okay. Alright. See that doesn't count as the key determinant of whether or not you're in the labor force. You're in the labor force if you're working or looking for work in the past four weeks. So that seemingly simple question is not going to be unambiguously signaled by somebody answering an internet question because of the many different ways we think about our lives and about what work is, we find this particularly true as our country becomes, I think it's a good thing, more and more culturally diverse. People come in with very different views of what is work, of what is pay of what is a family, what is a household, and we have to work harder and harder and harder to make sure that their responses fit this continuous, since 1943, continuous stream of data that allows us to do these wonderful time series analysis. That's the issue, Tracy, with using internet data. Some of it can be used and blended in. Some of it from the private sector can be used and blended in, but some cannot. You still have to have that survey instrument out there asking the hard questions, doing the follow-ups.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (39:17): There are some people who simply do not believe the statistical agencies are honest or they do not trust when academic economists explain why data gets revised a year later or something like that. And they assume that there is political influence of some sort or they believe it and it goes back years. I remember 2012 years ago, Jack Welch, the Chicago guys will do anything, can't believe these jobs, numbers, et cetera. You were appointed in 2019 by President Trump and you crossed over to Biden. What do you say to people who do not believe that they could trust these numbers?\n\nBill Beach (39:57): Well, I can't dislodge their suspicions without going to some factual basis. So, I take 'em through the simplest revision process, which is the jobs revision. We had 818,000 preliminary estimate of a decrease in employment that was announced last August and everybody, President Trump was running for it at the time and he just said, look at this. This is totally dishonest BLS. Okay, so this happens every year. We compare our numbers to a sampling frame with all the people who work in the entire country and we say, is our estimate of total employment based on a much smaller sample than all the firms? Is it accurate? When we go up there and we compare it every March to this total universe, we sometimes find we're spot on less than one tenth of a percent off. And sometimes we find we're as much as 2% or 3% off that we're off more often when the economy is either diving into recession or growing rapidly out of a recession or has a period of really bad time happening. So when I take 'em through the revision process, they usually come out and say, I never knew that. And so the next time they think about, oh, the BLS is lying, they'll have that in their mind that really, we do this every year. It's the same way. And we're pretty good with those numbers.\n\nTracy Alloway (41:23): So I want to ask you about qualitative adjustments. I find these so interesting and the example I used was fridges that now have, I don't know, new and interesting features. And my understanding is that if a company is selling a basic refrigerator for like $1,000 and then the next year it sells this new advanced refrigerator for $1,150 and then it's also spending additional money, so like an extra $100 or whatever to make the more advanced fridge in cases like that, the BLS would use a qualitative adjustment. And then the year on year PPI would be something like, I don't know, it would be 5% instead of the 15% change in the actual price. How do you actually go about making those qualitative adjustments? And I imagine they must have been getting harder as things become more technologically complex.\n\nBill Beach (42:20): Well you're absolutely right. It is very difficult to do that. But we do a lot of training. A lot of people don't know that at the national headquarters there is a training suite, I think it's on the second floor at least before we moved out of that building. And so people from the regions who are the CPI and PPI field teams that go out and do the surveying, they come to the BLS for training. And in these training rooms are kitchens, there are grocery store aisles. We've recreated kind of the inventory you might find in a grocery store or a warehouse. And we will train people from time to time on the changes in the items in the CPI, the 200+ items in the CPI or the items that we're surveying at the producer price level. So if there is a change all the way from the number of potato chips in a bag, which is a very important thing when we will look at fast foods and potato chips and so forth, all the way to the technology involved in diamond cutting, we will be training people to observe the change and work that into their evaluation of the product when they're in the store, when they're in the warehouse.\n\nSo the field person will literally pick up a jar of, if I could say Pringles, and they'll say, well last month we had 36 Pringles in here and it's this month it's the same price, but we only have 32 Pringles in here.\n\nTracy Alloway (43:55): Wow. True granularity.\n\nBill Beach (43:56): Yeah. So that fits into now—\n\nJoe Weisenthal (44:01): PPP, the price per Pringle, keep going.\n\nBill Beach (44:05): Exactly. But it has to be that way because what will happen is the retailer or the producer will keep the price at the same level but decrease the item count in the product bag. And that means that the product has actually gone up in price, not, doesn't have the same price. Let me just say one more thing. Great question Tracy. That's the reason why we can't go to the internet and get all of our prices because when you go to the internet, you can't sometimes see the quality adjustments that are there. You can't see that the fact that hot dogs are just a little shorter than they used to be or the apple's a little smaller than they used to be. I don't know about the apple thing, but the shorter hotdog is definitely the case. So you to, we train these people, they're highly trained and they're also very expensive because they're highly trained people and they can see and know when to look and when to check for quality improvements. Electronics definitely, but a lot of times the producers of the electronics will heavily advertise the changes, make it known to everybody what you're selling new and improved. It's on these other items that it is more subtle and housing is a big deal because the house is more valuable if it has improvements in it. And some of those improvements are completely invisible. So we're very conscious of the fact that quality governs the price structure.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (45:36): Bill Beach, that was a fascinating conversation. I feel like some of these areas, even just talking about the art of actually conducting an interview to see if someone's in the labor force, really fascinating stuff. Really appreciate you coming on. That's something we, we've wanted to talk to someone about for a long time. So, appreciate you joining Odd Lots.\n\nBill Beach (45:55): It's been a pleasure. Thank you very much.\n\nPost-Interview Discussion\n\nJoe Weisenthal (46:13): Tracy. I thought that was great.\n\nTracy Alloway (46:15): I'm so glad we finally did that one. [Joe: Yeah.] A couple points, first of all I did not know that hot dogs have been getting shorter.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (46:21): Me neither.\n\nTracy Alloway (46:22): And it's being incorporated into the inflation data. So all—\n\nJoe Weisenthal (46:25): This is good to know.\n\nTracy Alloway (46:25): All the people complaining about shrinkflation, I guess it is mitigated to some—\n\nJoe Weisenthal (46:30): They're aware of it.\n\nTracy Alloway (46:32): Yeah, exactly. And then the other thing I would say is I thought the point Bill was making about the loss of granularity in the data was really important. So the idea of getting to the tails of the distribution or certain minorities, and the reason I say that is because we've been seeing a lot of regional and social variation in a lot of these consumer surveys. So obviously people who are poorer have been feeling terrible during the days of high inflation. And people who are rich feel pretty good, but, also inflation in Florida has been higher than elsewhere in the country. So I think it does become more important to get really, really specific with some of these statistics as we see those differences increase.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (47:18): It's really interesting to me to think about government, high quality government data as this public good and try to imagine—\n\nTracy Alloway (47:28): Infrastructure, right?\n\nJoe Weisenthal (47:29): Infrastructure and try to imagine the amount of economic activity that exists because this thing is offered for free that people don't have to pay for. And obviously in the investing world, there's a tremendous amount of interest in all this, but it's obviously not just the investing world. And so all of these questions, whether you're starting a business or whatever it is, on some level, you can do because there is consistent trustworthy data. And the thought of that going away and what I imagine would happen is, yeah, sure you'd have private versions of varying quality that would try to replace it and that exists today. There's private measures of inflation, et cetera. But that would start to deteriorate the idea of there being a gold standard. And so then you hear it's like, oh, oh, we needed to find a few more million dollars to pay the budget of the survey collectors. How many billions are riding on that few extra millions? How many? Hundreds of billions in activity. So it's just really interesting. And then his thing, explanation at the end, why survey collection for something like this makes sense to do as a trained job. And even the subjectivity of like, are you working and what does that mean and et cetera. It's really interesting to think about why it's not trivial to just send out a survey or send out a high schooler or send out a volunteer or something like that.\n\nTracy Alloway (48:53): Absolutely. Also, I just love the idea of someone at the BLS counting how many potato chips are in a bag? [Joe: I know.] Or a tube.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (48:59): You know what I, I'm imagining, I don't know, someone with a monocle—\n\nTracy Alloway (49:05): Yeah that's—a magnifying glass, examining the chips, seeing how big they are.\n\nJoe Weisenthal (49:10): Yeah, we're having the same image in our mind, I'm sure right now. Yeah.\n\nTracy Alloway (49:14): Alright, shall we leave it there?\n\nJoe Weisenthal (49:15): Yeah, let's leave it there.","html":"<p><em><strong>Publisher’s note (Nathan Tankus):</strong> </em>A while ago I got the permission of my friends at Bloomberg Oddlots to clean up and publish transcripts of episodes that they didn’t have the time or inclination to produce (Incidentally, you can check out the New York Times profile of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/03/business/odd-lots-podcast-bloomberg.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Oddlots published yesterday</u></a>).

I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (01:19):</strong> And I'm Tracy Alloway.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (01:20):</strong> Tracy, I've said this a bunch of times, and we've sort of danced around this issue on the podcast before, but I've said this a bunch of times. I'm sort of fascinated by the degree to which we sort of take numbers on the screen for granted. Like, you know we look at a price of a stock and it exists on the screen. It's like, where did that come from? How did that get there? Or like the first Friday of the month, the jobs data flashes on the screen and we just start talking about what the data said, what the unemployment rate was, et cetera. But we don't really talk enough about what had to happen behind the scenes to get that number to the screen.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (01:54):</strong> Right, I find this really interesting as well because obviously there's the data collection portion of this like—</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (02:01):</strong> You have to go out and talk to people for certain surveys, certain data points, but also there are so many qualitative and subjective adjustments that you can make to that data. So for instance, with CPI, I didn't know that CPI weightings are like different depending on what city you're in. [Joe: Oh, interesting.] So for instance, food at home could matter a lot more in, I don't know, Minneapolis compared to Chicago. It's really interesting and there's also qualitative adjustments, so if your fridge gets WiFi connectivity, then that gets incorporated into the price as well. So it's really interesting.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (02:38):</strong> It's super interesting and this is the issue. We don't talk about data collection, but it's obviously some of the most interesting stuff there is because of course things like food at home in one city should be different than another city if you really want to collect a basket. So it means that what you have is some of the most interesting economics work being done anywhere in a realm that virtually gets no attention. When we talk about data collection, you hear it a lot in politics, surveys have gotten, no one answers the phone, it's harder and harder to do high quality surveys. I think you've written about this response rates and just the actual cost of collection of all this data is on the rise.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (03:20):</strong> So I have a bunch of thoughts on this. I'll just say talking about the economic data might be timely as well because we know that Trump doesn't really respect, I guess a lot of official economic data and he's also trying to cut back on costs or funding of a bunch of different government programs. So it's clear that entities like the Bureau of Labor Statistics could potentially be in the crosshairs here. But you're right, response rates, lower response rates have been happening for a long time and it's really easy to look up just how bad things have gotten. If you look at the BLS website for instance, look at response rates on the housing portion of CPI, that's gone from about 70% back in 2015 to just 57% now.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (04:09):</strong> Wow.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (04:10):</strong> Response rates on JOLTS have gone from I think 67% to just 30%. So that's pretty amazing and the other interesting thing here is it's not just a U.S. problem. There's no U.S. exceptionalism here. You see the same pattern in other economies like the UK and New Zealand and actually in the UK just last month the Office of National Statistics said it wasn't going to publish PPI because of a data quality issue and also trade data had a problem because of errors in the data provided by revenue and customs. And now there's a task force to look at all of these mistakes and data problems that the ONS has, so something that goes beyond the U.S. here.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (04:52):</strong> This is a really big deal, especially when you just consider how much economic activity is based on being able to look at high quality data and make decisions from it, obviously in the market, but also in just sort of the quote, real economy, et cetera. Anyway, without further ado, we really do have the perfect guest, someone who knows a lot about how the sausage is made and why making the sausage is getting more expensive. We are going to be speaking to Bill Beach. He was most recently the commissioner of the BLS and he knows all about this. He was the 15th commissioner at the BLS, does research affiliated with the Economic Policy Innovation Center, and he's going to talk to us about all of these issues. Bill, thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (05:37):</strong> Man, it is great to be with you and Tracy, thank you very much. It's a great topic right now.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (05:42):</strong> It's a great topic. I don't know when the process begins, but it's like I get this number. It says what the jobs report, it says how many jobs were created that month. How did that number get onto my screen or onto bls.gov?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (05:57):</strong> It gets there every month—</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (06:00):</strong> Yeah, every month. Every month, it is never missed except maybe once in a hurricane or something. Anyway, how did it get there?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (06:05):</strong> Yeah, the first Friday report, the jobs report, which comes out at 8:30 EST on the first Friday, it consists of two surveys. So let me talk about the first one, which is the one you just mentioned, the number of jobs. That is a survey of about 400,000 firms out of 11.3 million firms in the United States. About 400,000 of them have agreed voluntarily to send in a pretty complex survey response every month. They send that survey to electronic collection centers. There's one in Chicago, there's one in Atlanta. That survey has to contain the 12th day of the month, if it is a workday or the closest workday to that 12th of November or whatever. And the reason for that is we want to get at least one pay period in the report. So they submit that data, it continues to be collected through almost the end of the month, not quite, but almost the end of the month. It goes from regional offices, these regional collection centers to the national headquarters in Washington where about 40 people, sometimes less, out of the 2,000 people that work there massage the data. This means that they take the data, which is in the survey, it's a sample, it's just a fragment of the total population and they multiply the responses by what are called weights and that gives us the national number.</p><p>So that number is all done pretty much by Tuesday night preceding the Friday and on Wednesday the commissioner gets to hear the data. The commissioner, by the way, plays no role whatsoever in massaging the data or multiplying the survey results times the weights. Then, I would brief the White House. The White House would then brief the Federal Reserve Board chairman, the Secretary of the Treasury on Thursday, that Thursday night usually. They're sworn to secrecy. Then at eight o'clock in the morning I would walk over to the Department of Labor because BLS headquarters is about a 20 minute walk from the Department of Labor. I would brief the Secretary of Labor and for an hour from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM, the Secretary of Labor and his staff had to remain quiet and then at 9:30 AM they could answer questions of the press.</p><p>So, that basically is the process for the jobs report. There's another survey there, interrupt me at any time, but that's where we get the unemployment rates. It's called the household survey. That's a survey of 60,000 households selected out of a sampling frame. We can talk about that term to be representative of the entire United States by demographic segments, how many people are in a certain age group, male, female, the racial and ethnic compositions in geographic locations. So it's a complex sample. That sample is done usually by Monday of the week prior to the release on Friday. And then again, I get to see the results, so the commissioner gets to see the results on Wednesday. So, that's kind of the calendar. Both the household survey and the employment survey cover the same two week period in the month. Now there may be a day or two switch there. Sometimes the household survey has a few more days in it than the establishment survey, but they all target that 12th of the month because we're trying to get the middle of the month. By the way, that's real important because if you have a natural disaster that happens prior to the 12th or after the surveys are closed, that does not affect the results even though you would think since it happened in the month prior that the hurricane might've affected employment results.</p><p><strong>Tracy (11:30):</strong> So one thing you mentioned is companies voluntarily responding to these surveys and one thing I always wondered about is how I guess onerous, or resource intensive is responding to these surveys. So do I have to have a person who's dedicated to doing this every month? Does it consume resources? How long is this going to take me? And then also does the BLS ever try to fact check some of these self-reported data points?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (12:03):</strong> Those are great questions. So the survey is not just one or two questions. It takes about 30 minutes to fill it out completely. We do get responses that are incomplete and we accept those incomplete responses. The survey is usually filled out by someone who can access the company's data on wages, on total employment, on employment by supervisory or non-supervisory job functions. In other words, it's a person usually in the operations office of a company. Now we ask companies that are very large like the big box retailers all the way down to really small corporations or small firms and it becomes more and more of a difficulty for the smaller firms and we're very cognizant of that. So BLS has reduced the scope of the survey to get it as small as possible and as free of burdensome compliance as possible. It's also an electronic survey so they can fill it out on their computer screens and hit a submit button, which greatly improved our response rate by the way.</p><p>So that survey's not so hard now to fill out though. I think it still takes about 30 minutes, maybe more if you have to dig out the data if you're not in possession of it. The household survey is a totally different beast. It is a long survey. It consists of over 120 questions. It really is hard to fill out if you don't know the terminology. Let me just give you one. We ask the question on employment, are you working or have you looked for work in the past four weeks? That's the key question. We've been asking that question since I think 1943. If they answer I'm working, then they are considered employed. We'll have follow up questions about that, about their industry, about their tasks and so forth. If they say, no, I'm not working, then we say, well, did you look for work in the past four weeks? And they'll say, well, maybe I thought about it. Well, thinking about it's not enough. You can look for one day in the past four weeks and be considered in the labor force but unemployed. So, sometimes we have to have a verbal follow-up rather than they're just filling out a form. There has to be a conversation. That's why we don't do more than 60,000 households because it is burdensome for the person who's the questioner.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (14:36):</strong> This leads right into I think what I was about to ask you, which is we're having this conversation April 22, 2025, your term of office at the BLS ended March 2023. So you're actually under both the two recent presidents under the first Trump administration then Biden, but let's say it's March, 2023, how much costlier is that process of communicating with the households than it was say in 2013 or 2003?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (15:08):</strong> It was more costly certainly, and that's because of inflation and how inflation affected the wage bill for the survey.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (15:16):</strong> Okay.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (15:18):</strong> The survey is taken by the Census Bureau under a contract by BLS, so we pay the Census Bureau to go out in the field and conduct the survey.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (15:27):</strong> Okay.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (15:29):</strong> Here's an idea of how much more expensive it was in 2019, which is the first year of my term. I didn't have to find any additional funding for the household survey. It might've been just small amount, but nothing significant. By 2023, we were having to find almost $4 million, $5 million more. So the cost of the survey—</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (15:52):</strong> Is that per year, per month?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (15:54):</strong> That would be for the entire year.</p><p>The cost of the survey went up significantly. Now your listeners will be thinking about the federal budget, which is in the trillions of dollars and say, oh, that's not very much money, but the bureau's budget has not really changed for almost a decade and our costs have gone up progressively. Especially during the period of significant inflation, which we had starting in 2021. So, finding additional money is really hard. During the pandemic, I found millions of dollars of couch money, unused conference fees, unused travel fees, so I could apply that couch money to purposes like beefing up the CPS or building a data—we built a brand-new data center out in the suburb of Washington. But once we were back in business and fully using entire budget, it was very difficult to find those dollars to fill the hole. And I think you could safely say, I've been arguing this now for over two years, our surveys, but especially the current population survey, the one that gives us the unemployment rate, the labor force data are dying, they're decaying, they're in very serious trouble and we will have, unless we modernize that survey, we will see a time when we will be like the British right, unable to publish portions of it that just don't have sufficient sample for statistical release.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (17:28):</strong> Okay, so I'm going to ask the obvious question here, but why have costs of conducting these surveys gathering this data actually gone up? I understand building data centers is probably an expensive process, but on the other hand, going electronic instead of mailing out thousands and thousands of surveys, in theory I would imagine maybe that saves you some money. So what exactly is causing the increase in expenses here?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (17:56):</strong> The problem is not with the electronic surveys. They will eventually be very cost-effective and there we're suffering from a different problem, which is just public support for the electronic surveys. So the jobs report that is that portion of it that's electronically captured by these collection centers in Chicago and Atlanta. I think those are going along all right for the time being. Our real problem is in the surveys, the data of which is collected by people, survey field survey people, they go out and they talk to the households and there the cost is the obvious one. It is the wage bill. These people are highly skilled interviewers. They're not high school graduates and I have nothing against high school graduates, but they're educated, very trained. Oftentimes economists who will go out and speak to people and do follow-up interviews, my gosh, and they'll spend hours and hours doing this.</p><p>Well, okay, fine, that's great, but it costs a lot to keep those people employed. They have other opportunities, so we have to have competitive wages. The wage bill is driving that. Collection costs are a little bit higher. That is the processing costs, but the big part of that is the wage bill and the wage bill is not going to go away. That's just going to continue to go up. So, what we need to do with the household survey, what we have done with the establishment survey, the firm survey, and that is modernize it, so it is more electronically collected and then we also need to integrate data which can be obtained through the internet on households. Households maybe go onto a platform with a tablet or something and supply, maybe we go to a million households and they supply five or six questions and we combine that or blend it with person to person collected data. That's what we call modernization. It may not sound so innovative to your listeners, but it is very innovative for the statistical system. Unless we do that, the cost will continue to rise. The response rates, by the way, are continuing to decline. So that's public support and we be, we just won't have these surveys in the future. It's too expensive.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (20:22):</strong> I want to get to the modernization in a second, but just talk to us about, I mean I think you said the survey's dying, which is pretty dramatic given the centrality of this between the response rates, the increased wage bill, et cetera, how severe is this crisis? How much time are we talking about? Because I imagine it gets harder and harder to find that couch change to keep it going.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (20:49):</strong> Yeah, actually we're out of time. We have to cut down on the sample and I'll give you the evidence. My successor, the current commissioner of labor statistics announced at the end of last year that we would have to reduce the sample in the CPS. That's the household survey by 5,000 households in order to just publish the rest of the sample. Okay, by cutting back on the sample, you cut back on publishing details in the current report, you may not have enough to publish on teenagers anymore, on certain demographic groups. You may not be able to publish details on certain age intervals, like everyone between the ages of 55 and 60 or 65 and 75. Every time you reduce the sample, or your response rate falls, it kind of reduces it for you, we can talk about that. Next, what suffers are the details. Let's go to the CPI, which BLS also does. The CPI is a very big survey, very important survey, but it is oftentimes the case that we don't have details for certain parts of the basket of goods and so we will average across the months and publish for another month based on averages of prior months, but then we run out of the integrity of that average and we can't publish the bread price or something like that.</p><p>That happens more and more because we're getting less and less cooperation by retailers to allow our surveyors into their stores and to go around grabbing the potato chip bag and counting the number of potato chips in the bag. So, we've had to innovate on the CPI on the producer price index, on the import export price indexes. I hope you haven't noticed the innovations because you're not supposed to, but those innovations have saved, absolutely saved the import and export prices. We had response rates down in the 20 percentiles, completely unpublishable detail during the time I was commissioner. We went to using data from the commerce department that is collected by the customs officials and it's working out just great. So we completely left the surveys there. The PPI has problems just like the British are having now, not as bad, and we're using more and more data from private companies who will give us their data from the internet where we collect that data and we combine that with the survey data to keep the things alive on the CPI. It's very interesting. We get all of our retail gas prices now from a private company that aggregates gas prices for the retail gasoline industry and it's a very good source. A lot of our housing prices, now you mentioned housing, we're going to more and more to aggregators, private aggregators. So there are strategies for saving the survey by blending in private data with the survey data. That is not the case with the household survey of the labor force. Nobody really collects that data, except BLS. That's why these demographic surveys census has a bunch of them. Health, the health department, the Department of Health has a lot. They're in very serious trouble.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (24:24):</strong> So I take the point about innovations, but one of the things that's been happening recently is we have been seeing bigger and bigger revisions in a lot of the data. Is that because of the response issue? So more late responses mean that you're going to get revisions later on as those responses are incorporated. And the reason I ask is I remember speaking to someone at the BLS and here, shout out to the people working at the BLS because you can actually just call them and ask questions. They're really, really responsive—amazingly like the only government department that I really know where they'll just pick up the phone and talk to you about methodology. Anyway, I was asking about revisions to PPI for mayonnaise of all things, and the data there had been revised from like 5% to 10%, which is a pretty big change in the space of a couple months. And he was talking about how the PPI is subject to revision up to four months after it's published and it gets updated as new replies come in. So I imagine if response rates are going lower, then maybe that's contributing to some of the revision issue.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (25:34):</strong> By and large, our issues have to do with response rate. You're absolutely right, and before I go further, I'm very, very happy you said that about BLS because BLS prides itself in being responsive and transparent by the way. So that's a good thing. So I think there are two sources of this problem. The first is really hidden and no one talks about it. So let me just mention when we refresh a survey and you have to do this because people are asked to give their survey responses only for a few months and then they drop out and you have to find new people. The regional offices, there's six of them in the United States for the BLS, they have people who go out and do what's called initiate a new survey respondent. It's getting more and more difficult now to initiate that respondent. People are saying, we just don't have time. Oh my gosh, there's so many important things to do, or we don't want to give you our data because if we give you our data, then the IRS is going to be after us or we're going to have some kind of OSHA. BLS's data is completely protected from the law enforcement aspects of the federal government. It's absolutely only for statistical purposes. That does not prevent people saying, oh, that's going to happen. So if your initiations are dropping and it's harder and harder, no wonder the response rates are dropping because people are less enthusiastic. Even if they say, yeah, I'd love to be a part of it, they're not as enthusiastic as they were a generation ago.</p><p>So the real problem starts at the initiation level and we're seeing that not only in the household survey and in the price area, but we're also seeing that in another survey we haven't talked about, the national compensation survey. It's a wonderful survey on how much people are getting in union houses, union households, and non-union households in Northeast and the Southwest is terrific about that. The JOLTS report, the job openings and labor turnover survey that you mentioned at the opening. Its response rate has fallen dramatically and it's largely because people are less enthusiastic generally about participating in government surveys. It's going to be hard to stem that tide, and I think the only way we can do it is by going to these platform surveys. That is surveys that use the internet as the main platform, integrating a lot of private data and being highly original in the way we think about preparing a statistic for public use. We're just not going to be facing a different world overnight of really happy people wanting to give all their data to the government.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (28:20):</strong> It's really a fallen world, I'll say that. They won't let you in the store to look at the price of bread anyway. What would it take to get there? Can this be done unilaterally within the BLS, this sort of big upgrade? Would it need to be something involved with Congress? Would it need a budget allocation that would come from Congress? What would need to happen to get the sort of modernized statistical collection system you would like actually in place?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (28:45):</strong> I think we have to approach this like we might approach roads and bridges, right? Once Congress becomes aware that there's political liability in ignoring a problem, they generally focus on it until it's fixed. And that was the case with our national highway system, still is the case with our national highway system. We still have a lot of problems. When I go to Congress and I talk about the CPS and response rate, how we're going to lose the unemployment rate, I get immediate response and you know \"communist\", no one's ever said that to me. So, in the last congressional continuing resolution, which was passed few weeks ago, BLS got $6 million more in funding just to fill that hole that we've been talking about on the wage bill. And that was an amazing thing to get in a continuing resolution, an increase in funding.</p><p>So I think Congress presented with a plan or the administration, President Trump is wide open to disruption and change. I think if we develop an aggressive, bold, comprehensive plan about how to rebuild the statistical system so that we're using our resources much more efficiently, perhaps combining some agencies together, instead of having the 24 separate statistical agencies, maybe we ought to have just a handful. And then going from there to a highly innovative different way of collecting and disseminating data, then our roads and bridges, statistically speaking, won't be disintegrating or decaying. We will have new concrete, we'll have new structures, and you can see a future for the statistical system. I think right now speaking as a former director of an agency, one of the most important statistical agencies if not the most important statistical agency in the world, that future looks grim to me. And so change is required. It has to happen, and I think that's what we have to do. Present it with the plan, let Congress see what we're going to do and have them fund modernization, not continuation of the current system.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (30:48):</strong> This is a little out there, but if the problem is the response rates and incentivizing people to actually answer these surveys, could you potentially pay them to do it?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (31:00):</strong> Tracy, we've tried that. It has been tried a lot. Good suggestion. Yeah, pay them dollars. Okay, tried that didn't make much of a difference. Then we thought, well maybe they'd like to have these cards you can take to retailers and buy anything you want. Right? So we tried that. That's not the issue. I think you could pay people a lot of money, say a thousand dollars a month and they might participate because that's a lot of money, but we can't afford that. That's not out there for the statistical system. So inducements may help at the margin, but they don't change the trend line, which is going negative on the response rate. I think we're going to live with that response rate for a while. I do believe it's generational. I think you can see in the really young kids now, not the ones that are under five, but in the ones that are in their teens kind of a return to doing things together, having more social events, maybe I wouldn't say the bowling leagues are coming back and maybe that's a cultural change that leads to a greater sense of participation and support of public institutions. One could hope.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (32:17):</strong> I like the idea of all the kids coming together to answer surveys from the BLS. That's great.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (32:23):</strong> I think you'd get some interesting answers there. But yes, short of that, we have to be innovative. We have to change. We have to think outside the box. Otherwise this infrastructure, which we all need, it runs our country. There's no economy without the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the GDP numbers; they don't grow on trees. That's going to be either going to go away or become less reliable.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (34:11):</strong> Something that strikes me while listening to you talk and like, oh, you found a way to allocate unused travel spending so that you could keep the surveys going after the wage bill went up, et cetera, I keep rustling for the couch change. And I think about this in you mentioned, okay, well maybe the new president is theoretically open to shaking things up and doing things a different way, which you argue pretty persuasively is necessary. On the other hand, you have the sort of DOGE kick, which is sort of premised on this idea that every agency in the government somehow is just egregiously wasteful. That all of these agencies must be so wasteful that you could cut aggressively and you almost certainly aren't actually going to hit any bone. Seems to be a sort of premise of some of the cutting. It doesn't sound like to me when you described the BLS in 2019 through 2023 that this was an agency that was just you know larded up and plenty of fat that can be trimmed off.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (35:14):</strong> No fat, no fat at all. But this is the age old conflict, right? Between the entrepreneur and the accountant. The entrepreneur is always looking for innovation and change and higher return on investment and the accountant is always looking for waste and abuse. Are we using our pencils until they're only three inches long? I think that's a fruitful thing. I think you have to have both of those forces working all the time and overtime. Right now, I don't doubt for one second that a lot of the federal could use a thorough scrubbing on the things that DOGE is looking at. The statistical system has unfortunately, in my opinion, but fortunately now been through that scrubbing over the past 15 years. No real increase in budgets and yet an increase in responsibility. So efficiencies have been gained there just from the brutality of living year after year after year with the same dollar amount while your costs are going up while inflation is changing. Don't mind that because efficiencies can occur and we can do more with fewer dollars. That's okay. Innovation on the other hand, has to be kind of funded by your retained earnings and we don't have that in the statistical system. Congress has that, so we're not getting the dollars necessary to innovate and secure the future. That's the problem I want everybody kind of focus on.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (36:37):</strong> So, you mentioned earlier that you had used internet data to try to make up for the lack of a certain data point or a certain response from the surveys. And I'm curious, there is the sense nowadays that everything we do is tracked and recorded somewhere. Could you potentially use some of that type of data instead of voluntarily reported responses?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (37:02):</strong> So to an extent you can use that if you have an unambiguous signal and you can capture that unambiguous signal month after month, why not capture it? Why not capture, for example, certain pay bands or other things that are happening in the labor force or with wages or with working conditions? The restraint there is that not everything we want to know about the world is unambiguously signaled every month. And I go back to this seemingly easy question, are you working or looking for work? You would be surprised at the number of people who say, I'm working, but then we make that query. Did you work for pay? No. Okay, I did the dishes. Okay, fine. Well, that doesn't see in the mind of the respondent, work is defined differently than it needs to be defined in the statistics. Are you looking for work? Well, yeah, I'm looking for work. When did you look for work? Last year. Okay. Alright. See that doesn't count as the key determinant of whether or not you're in the labor force. You're in the labor force if you're working or looking for work in the past four weeks. So that seemingly simple question is not going to be unambiguously signaled by somebody answering an internet question because of the many different ways we think about our lives and about what work is, we find this particularly true as our country becomes, I think it's a good thing, more and more culturally diverse. People come in with very different views of what is work, of what is pay of what is a family, what is a household, and we have to work harder and harder and harder to make sure that their responses fit this continuous, since 1943, continuous stream of data that allows us to do these wonderful time series analysis. That's the issue, Tracy, with using internet data. Some of it can be used and blended in. Some of it from the private sector can be used and blended in, but some cannot. You still have to have that survey instrument out there asking the hard questions, doing the follow-ups.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (39:17):</strong> There are some people who simply do not believe the statistical agencies are honest or they do not trust when academic economists explain why data gets revised a year later or something like that. And they assume that there is political influence of some sort or they believe it and it goes back years. I remember 2012 years ago, Jack Welch, the Chicago guys will do anything, can't believe these jobs, numbers, et cetera. You were appointed in 2019 by President Trump and you crossed over to Biden. What do you say to people who do not believe that they could trust these numbers?</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (39:57):</strong> Well, I can't dislodge their suspicions without going to some factual basis. So, I take 'em through the simplest revision process, which is the jobs revision. We had 818,000 preliminary estimate of a decrease in employment that was announced last August and everybody, President Trump was running for it at the time and he just said, look at this. This is totally dishonest BLS. Okay, so this happens every year. We compare our numbers to a sampling frame with all the people who work in the entire country and we say, is our estimate of total employment based on a much smaller sample than all the firms? Is it accurate? When we go up there and we compare it every March to this total universe, we sometimes find we're spot on less than one tenth of a percent off. And sometimes we find we're as much as 2% or 3% off that we're off more often when the economy is either diving into recession or growing rapidly out of a recession or has a period of really bad time happening. So when I take 'em through the revision process, they usually come out and say, I never knew that. And so the next time they think about, oh, the BLS is lying, they'll have that in their mind that really, we do this every year. It's the same way. And we're pretty good with those numbers.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (41:23):</strong> So I want to ask you about qualitative adjustments. I find these so interesting and the example I used was fridges that now have, I don't know, new and interesting features. And my understanding is that if a company is selling a basic refrigerator for like $1,000 and then the next year it sells this new advanced refrigerator for $1,150 and then it's also spending additional money, so like an extra $100 or whatever to make the more advanced fridge in cases like that, the BLS would use a qualitative adjustment. And then the year on year PPI would be something like, I don't know, it would be 5% instead of the 15% change in the actual price. How do you actually go about making those qualitative adjustments? And I imagine they must have been getting harder as things become more technologically complex.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (42:20):</strong> Well you're absolutely right. It is very difficult to do that. But we do a lot of training. A lot of people don't know that at the national headquarters there is a training suite, I think it's on the second floor at least before we moved out of that building. And so people from the regions who are the CPI and PPI field teams that go out and do the surveying, they come to the BLS for training. And in these training rooms are kitchens, there are grocery store aisles. We've recreated kind of the inventory you might find in a grocery store or a warehouse. And we will train people from time to time on the changes in the items in the CPI, the 200+ items in the CPI or the items that we're surveying at the producer price level. So if there is a change all the way from the number of potato chips in a bag, which is a very important thing when we will look at fast foods and potato chips and so forth, all the way to the technology involved in diamond cutting, we will be training people to observe the change and work that into their evaluation of the product when they're in the store, when they're in the warehouse.</p><p>So the field person will literally pick up a jar of, if I could say Pringles, and they'll say, well last month we had 36 Pringles in here and it's this month it's the same price, but we only have 32 Pringles in here.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (43:55):</strong> Wow. True granularity.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (43:56):</strong> Yeah. So that fits into now—</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (44:01):</strong> PPP, the price per Pringle, keep going.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (44:05):</strong> Exactly. But it has to be that way because what will happen is the retailer or the producer will keep the price at the same level but decrease the item count in the product bag. And that means that the product has actually gone up in price, not, doesn't have the same price. Let me just say one more thing. Great question Tracy. That's the reason why we can't go to the internet and get all of our prices because when you go to the internet, you can't sometimes see the quality adjustments that are there. You can't see that the fact that hot dogs are just a little shorter than they used to be or the apple's a little smaller than they used to be. I don't know about the apple thing, but the shorter hotdog is definitely the case. So you to, we train these people, they're highly trained and they're also very expensive because they're highly trained people and they can see and know when to look and when to check for quality improvements. Electronics definitely, but a lot of times the producers of the electronics will heavily advertise the changes, make it known to everybody what you're selling new and improved. It's on these other items that it is more subtle and housing is a big deal because the house is more valuable if it has improvements in it. And some of those improvements are completely invisible. So we're very conscious of the fact that quality governs the price structure.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (45:36):</strong> Bill Beach, that was a fascinating conversation. I feel like some of these areas, even just talking about the art of actually conducting an interview to see if someone's in the labor force, really fascinating stuff. Really appreciate you coming on. That's something we, we've wanted to talk to someone about for a long time. So, appreciate you joining Odd Lots.</p><p><strong>Bill Beach (45:55):</strong> It's been a pleasure. Thank you very much.</p><hr><p><strong>Post-Interview Discussion</strong></p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (46:13):</strong> Tracy. I thought that was great.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (46:15):</strong> I'm so glad we finally did that one. [Joe: Yeah.] A couple points, first of all I did not know that hot dogs have been getting shorter.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (46:21):</strong> Me neither.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (46:22):</strong> And it's being incorporated into the inflation data. So all—</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (46:25):</strong> This is good to know.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (46:25):</strong> All the people complaining about shrinkflation, I guess it is mitigated to some—</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (46:30):</strong> They're aware of it.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (46:32):</strong> Yeah, exactly. And then the other thing I would say is I thought the point Bill was making about the loss of granularity in the data was really important. So the idea of getting to the tails of the distribution or certain minorities, and the reason I say that is because we've been seeing a lot of regional and social variation in a lot of these consumer surveys. So obviously people who are poorer have been feeling terrible during the days of high inflation. And people who are rich feel pretty good, but, also inflation in Florida has been higher than elsewhere in the country. So I think it does become more important to get really, really specific with some of these statistics as we see those differences increase.</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (47:18):</strong> It's really interesting to me to think about government, high quality government data as this public good and try to imagine—</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (47:28):</strong> Infrastructure, right?</p><p><strong>Joe Weisenthal (47:29):</strong> Infrastructure and try to imagine the amount of economic activity that exists because this thing is offered for free that people don't have to pay for. And obviously in the investing world, there's a tremendous amount of interest in all this, but it's obviously not just the investing world. And so all of these questions, whether you're starting a business or whatever it is, on some level, you can do because there is consistent trustworthy data. And the thought of that going away and what I imagine would happen is, yeah, sure you'd have private versions of varying quality that would try to replace it and that exists today. There's private measures of inflation, et cetera. But that would start to deteriorate the idea of there being a gold standard. And so then you hear it's like, oh, oh, we needed to find a few more million dollars to pay the budget of the survey collectors. How many billions are riding on that few extra millions? How many? Hundreds of billions in activity. So it's just really interesting. And then his thing, explanation at the end, why survey collection for something like this makes sense to do as a trained job. And even the subjectivity of like, are you working and what does that mean and et cetera. It's really interesting to think about why it's not trivial to just send out a survey or send out a high schooler or send out a volunteer or something like that.</p><p><strong>Tracy Alloway (48:53):</strong> Absolutely.

We are also looking for more information on access to and use of IDRS. \n\nAs we shared in the first installment in the series, in early February, DOGE officials entered the Treasury and the IRS and acquired access to some degree of sensitive information. Since then, many DOGE personnel have transitioned into formal roles within these agencies, embedded as federal employees –  some through political appointments, others via opaque hiring mechanisms. The current situation involves two prongs. First, concerns exist that DOGE is seeking access across a range of federal government data systems, including those of the Social Security Administration and the IRS, potentially using the latter not for legitimate tax enforcement, but for political purposes  Second, while IRS system modernization is promoted as a positive technical advancement, this may serve as a means to expand surveillance and violate data privacy laws and protections. While integrating federal data systems may seem efficient, those barriers exist because they prevent the weaponization of data against the public.\n\nThis investigation peels back the layers of the power of the technological infrastructure at the IRS.  In the first piece, we demonstrated the importance of the IRS within the US government system and the potential for surveillance and control. In this piece, we reveal what we know about new tech activities under the guise of modernization and how these differ from the IRS's decades-long operational history. To better appreciate the gravity of these actions, we also examine the IRS’s institutional knowledge embedded in its extremely experienced civil service employees and the agency’s historical context that DOGE has been determined to steamroll and ignore.\n\nDespite our in-depth reporting efforts, the deliberate opacity surrounding DOGE’s actions and plans may be the most disturbing aspect. To truly grasp the scope of their intervention, we need more information - most crucially, their data access and usage (if that’s you, send us a signal DM!). Yet even in this information vacuum, we already know quite a lot about these systems and the tremendous power that comes with controlling the IRS's vast infrastructure.\n\nLet's first examine what we know about DOGE's actions and motivations before exploring how they diverge from the institution's history and their potential implications.\n\nDOGE’s initial rhetoric was full of grand promises about modernization, but their immediate priority quickly revealed itself: securing unprecedented access to sensitive taxpayer data. The reality is DOGE now wields access to the Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS) - a system which enables IRS employees to have instantaneous visual access to centralized digital records that contain all tax-related information for individuals or business entities managed through the IRS's legacy systems, many of which still rely on COBOL programming (more on this later). Who is associated with DOGE and has access to this system, and whether they are political appointees or hired in the civil service, is shrouded in secrecy. There is the potential that, regardless of their employment status, DOGE staff may now have access that exceeds what most IRS career civil servants—whose roles actually require access to taxpayer information—are allowed, let alone political appointees.\n\nTreasury officials have claimed that DOGE wasn’t given “broad access” to the IDRS or that the access is \"anonymized\" or, in some cases, \"read-only.\" These claims ring hollow given the absence of verifiable security protocols or independent oversight. Besides, even if the DOGE’s access was technically limited, there are serious risks associated with this level of access. The lack of transparency regarding data handling is particularly concerning, as staff have reported to Nathan Tankus from early on in the payments crisis that they have no designated authority left within the Treasury to whom they can safely report security protocol breaches.\n\nWhile the Internal Revenue Code provides robust protections for taxpayer data through Section 6103, which establishes confidentiality with strict penalties for violations and permits access and sharing only under specific, explicit circumstances, we cannot verify that DOGE officials comply with these rules. This oversight gap is especially troubling as they prepare to undertake their next ambitious project: a complete rewrite of legacy systems written in Assembly Code and COBOL - programming languages that form the foundation of many critical government functions.\n\n\nThe COBOL Gambit\n\nIt’s important to note that IRS modernization was underway long before DOGE arrived. The agency has spent years attempting to upgrade legacy systems and gradually phase out older programming languages like COBOL. What DOGE is attempting is not modernization in principle, but modernization at reckless speed, divorced from institutional knowledge and technical prudence.\n\nWired Reporting indicates an alarmingly naive plan to convert decades of critical COBOL code to Java through a 30-day “hackathon”, yet the true scope and timeline of this risky undertaking remain opaque. While the project's exact details are murky, their messaging suggests an unprecedented urgency in modernization efforts. In a March FOX News appearance, Sam Corcos (representing DOGE), alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant, launched targeted criticisms of the IRS's legacy systems. Bessent amplified these claims, declaring on social media that the IRS modernization program lags 35 years behind schedule. Corcos is now a Treasury political appointee who serves as the agency’s Chief Information Officer. A career civil servant previously held that role. \n\nThis rushed rhetoric perfectly exemplifies DOGE's toxic combination of technical hubris and institutional recklessness. Despite repeated inquiries from oversight bodies and the press and urgent warnings from veteran civil servants, Treasury and the IRS maintain radio silence on the details of this unprecedented system overhaul, keeping taxpayers and Congress blind to changes that could potentially devastate America's tax infrastructure.\n\n\nA History of “Modernization” and What We’ve Already Tried\n\nModernizing the IRS or any current government system is not a one-time software upgrade; it’s a multiyear institutional overhaul requiring stable funding, cross-agency coordination, and continuous technical labor. It also means maintaining dual systems for extended periods to ensure continuity for internal operations and taxpayer use, which is an expensive but necessary measure. What failed in the past wasn’t the vision of modernization but the refusal to consistently fund and maintain it. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), and the National Taxpayer Advocate have all stated the same thing for years: the IRS cannot modernize without multi-year, predictable investments.\n\nGAO reports dating back to the early 2000s have flagged the absence of long-term funding as an impediment to the agency’s modernization goals. The National Taxpayer Advocate has echoed this repeatedly, noting in a 2019 report that the IRS’s Business Systems Modernization program was delayed not by poor planning, but by the piecemeal and inconsistent nature of congressional appropriations. This is not a controversial opinion by any stretch. In fact, the private sector consistently emphasizes multi-year stable funding as a necessary condition for most projects, especially large-scale IT initiatives. There are many examples of multi-year stable funding being the prerequisite for success. JP Morgan invested over $12 billion every year for many years, resulting in the successful modernization of legacy systems and the development of new digital banking platforms.\n\nThe IRS's technology investment funding has seen many ups and downs since Congress's establishment of the Information Technology Investment Account in FY 1997. These funding levels fall far short of what private companies spend on system improvements, despite government agencies serving millions more people and facing higher costs and consequences of service disruptions. The spending categories vary over the years, but we can consistently identify the Business Systems Modernization category that clearly shows fluctuating modernization spending between 2006 and 2022. Before the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding in 2023, business system modernization spending peaked at $468 million (2024 $) in 2011 and reached its lowest point at $309 million (2024 $) in 2018. Following the IRA allocation, spending increased dramatically to $926 million (2024 $) in 2023 and $1.3 billion (current $) in 2024 for system modernization, not including Direct File and certain other specific expenditures.\n\nAgency staff we interviewed recognized this need for stable multi-year funding. Many expressed appreciation for the increased IRA spending and advocated for ways to maintain higher funding levels even after the IRA funds expire, noting that this influx had been instrumental in advancing several critical projects. Despite these challenges and contrary to DOGE's positioning as pioneers in recognizing the IRS's technological needs, the reality is that the agency has been actively pursuing modernization for over six decades. As we said earlier, there have been mixed results, not because of government inertia but because of political neglect and chronic underfunding.\n\nBeyond the funding and political challenges we discuss above, there is a fundamental misunderstanding about what IRS modernization entails - specifically, which aspects need modernization, the best path forward, and which elements have already been acknowledged and are being addressed versus what new components DOGE is introducing. \n\n\nWhat does modernizing the IRS entail? \n\nAt its core, IRS modernization represents an overhaul of technical infrastructure and taxpayer services. This approach addresses both internal operations and public-facing capabilities. Like many other organizations with legacy systems, the IRS faced a major IT challenge: the Y2K project - a massive undertaking to address the problem with the year 2000. This issue stemmed from the way dates were stored in computer systems, using two digits for the year instead of four, which meant that when the calendar turned to 2000, systems might interpret \"00\" as 1900 rather than 2000. A more recent example of modernization effort on the public-facing side is the introduction of Direct File, which was launched as a pilot program in 2024 to offer eligible taxpayers a free, government-provided tax filing option that simplifies the process and eliminates the need for third-party software.\n\nBut for the most part, the IRS has focused on modernizing its core infrastructure by gradually replacing COBOL and Assembly Language Code systems, especially within the Individual Master File (IMF). The IMF is the oldest operating database in the federal government, conceptualized in 1959 and developed in 1962 using Assembly Language Code and COBOL. IMF remains the authoritative system for tracking every individual taxpayer’s account activity: income, credits, payments, and refunds. Legacy systems written in COBOL and Assembly Language—many still operational—form the backbone of tax processing infrastructure. While DOGE officials claim to be replacing Assembly code with Java, COBOL-based systems were reportedly being migrated to new compilers or systems known as RM/COBOL which was also being implemented at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. A major advantage of RM/COBOLis that it makes the code platform agnostic, allowing it to run on platforms other than large powerful computing systems such as mainframes. To be clear, the details that have come out about DOGE’s efforts are murky and contradictory while it is difficult to get clarity on what exactly they are either doing, or even claiming to do.\n\nThe IRS has been planning and implementing a transition away from the original COBOL for over 20 years. That initiative, known as the Customer Account Data Engine (CADE), was launched in 2000 to replace the IMF and deliver a faster, more flexible system that could support real-time processing. According to a 2024 Congressional Research Service Report, CADE 1 ran into early trouble - delays, vendor issues, scope creep - and was shelved in 2009. Its successor, CADE 2, showed more promise but stalled, slowed by unstable funding and shifting political priorities.  Nevertheless, progress has occurred. According to a GAO report from March 2023, the IRS had completed major components of the Individual Tax Processing Engine and was preparing CADE 2 for broader testing. \n\nThese achievements remain partial, however, as modernization requires more than a one-time software upgrade. While DOGE may present this process as merely inefficient and project that they can do this better in a much shorter time, that is likely impossible. The IRS systems involve layers of complexities that come with operating at such a scale. There are intricate issues that require years of institutional knowledge - intimate understanding of the system in the context of the IRS and not just the expert technical know-how that some DOGE staffers may possess.\n\nAs Nathan has covered in his previous reporting on the Treasury payments system, the complexity of COBOL systems is widely misunderstood in general discourse and within modern tech industries. He explains: \"The issue with understanding and grasping a COBOL system is not knowing COBOL, as a programming language, in the abstract... The issue is understanding the specific physical limitations of the system, the way that it interacts with the 'Business Logic' of the code, and a million other contextual factors.\" This shows why contextual and institutional knowledge is crucial. Modernizing these COBOL systems requires more than mere language syntax fluency. These systems have developed intricate internal business logics that constitute vital institutional knowledge. Consequently, retaining engineers and staff who possess this knowledge and can train new engineers familiar with COBOL is an integral part of any successful modernization process.\n\nWhy this contextual knowledge matters is easily exemplified by the story behind a widespread misconception about social security beneficiaries. Contrary to claims amplified by Elon Musk, thousands of deceased individuals are not receiving benefits. The reality is far more mundane: early COBOL dialects handled null values poorly, so when someone applied for social security with a missing birth date, engineers implemented a specific date as a placeholder. They chose May 20, 1875 - the anniversary of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures' creation. Thus, while records might appear to show 150-year-old people receiving payments, the reality is entirely different and far less sensational. Yet, as Notes on the Crises covered in late April, these misconceptions have had profound consequences as DOGE moved millions of people to Social Security Administration’s “Death Master File”\n\nThis context of chronic and inconsistent funding, as well as the need for institutional knowledge, matters. DOGE now positions itself as the savior of an intentionally starved system. However, they’re doing so without the humility or historical understanding that modernization requires.\n\nThe challenges of modernization are not limited to external factors. IRS career staff we spoke with described a deep internal tension: while many recognize the agency’s outdated infrastructure, they’ve also grown wary, if not defensive, about change. This defensiveness isn’t irrational. The civil service has kept the IRS running despite a decades-long war of attrition, where budget cuts and political attacks have left it operating under siege. Staff described a churn of political appointees at Treasury arriving every few years, launching ambitious reform plans, and then departing before implementation, leaving half-built systems and institutional fatigue in their wake.\n\nThis constant disruption has created a culture that prizes internal stability, process, and procedure,  sometimes to a fault. As some staff acknowledged, parts of the agency have accumulated administrative bloat and redundancies over time, not because of modernization but due to the uneven political targeting of different IRS functions. Over the past few decades, enforcement divisions, taxpayer assistance programs, and IT infrastructure have all faced rolling waves of political scrutiny and budget cuts, while other areas remained untouched. This has created a patchwork organizational structure, where some offices are understaffed, while others carry redundant roles that once served as safeguards against chronic instability. \n\nThis raises a deeper question: if the IRS is essential political infrastructure and central to the functioning of the entire fiscal state, should it be subject to annual political fights over appropriations at all? Modernization can’t succeed if it remains hostage to short-term political cycles. What’s needed is structural commitment: stable funding, institutional continuity, and governance mechanisms that treat the IRS not as a punching bag, but as core democratic infrastructure. DOGE’s narrative ignores decades of defunded effort, bureaucratic workarounds, and congressional gridlock and pretends modernization failure was solely a product of technical incompetence rather than political constraint.\n\n\nLessons from the VA, the 1985 Tax Season, and DOGE’s “MUNCHABLE” Debacle\n\nModernization done right is incremental, transparent, and cautious. One of the clearest historical lessons comes from the IRS itself. In 1985, a rushed update to its computing system caused one of the worst tax seasons in U.S. history. Refunds were delayed for months. Erroneous notices were mailed to millions of Americans. Lines at local IRS offices stretched out the door. Congress was flooded with constituent complaints, and the crisis led to a series of internal audits and public hearings. That episode became known as the “tax season from hell.” It was a cautionary tale about the risks of rushed reform - an example of how modernization without governance can backfire. \n\nRecent events at other agencies have already demonstrated the dangers of hasty implementation. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, a DOGE staffer rapidly developed an AI tool to identify supposedly \"non-essential\" private company services, labeling them as \"MUNCHABLE.\" This resulted in the termination of nearly 600 contracts. When confronted about the errors, the DOGE staffer dismissed concerns, telling ProPublica, \"I’m sure mistakes were made. Mistakes are always made.\" The consequences of this cavalier approach proved severe. Among the terminated contracts were truly essential services, including maintenance for a gene sequencing device crucial for cancer treatment research, blood sample analysis for VA research projects, and tools designed to enhance nursing care quality.\n\nWith DOGE’s entrance into the IRS, the specter of catastrophic system-wide failure certainly looms large. The cautionary tale of 1985 still haunts the IRS. Given today's exponentially more complex tax systems and transaction volumes, DOGE's aggressive timeline and contempt for institutional knowledge could trigger a meltdown that makes 1985 look like a minor glitch.  IRS staff we interviewed described the MUNCHABLE episode as a “canary in the coal mine” for what could happen if similar tools were unleashed on taxpayer data or IRS operations.\n\nThe IRS cannot afford such recklessness. A single misstep in the system that processes refunds, verifies identity, or tracks withholding could delay paychecks, trigger false audits, or compromise vast swaths of sensitive personal data. DOGE’s insistence on speed and dismissal of internal IRS expertise doesn’t just increase the risk of failure. It makes failure all but inevitable.\n\nMeanwhile, additional risks have emerged around DOGE’s broader digital ambitions. Multiple sources flagged DOGE’s parallel effort to develop a “mega API” - a centralized interface intended to integrate IRS data with other federal databases. While framed as an efficiency tool, staff expressed alarm that it could enable cross-agency data sharing without adequate safeguards, including possible tracking of migrant populations, nonprofit activity, and union operations. These concerns echo broader patterns in administrative surveillance, where modernization rhetoric has historically masked new capacities for control. There are also growing concerns from staff about undocumented system changes and the possible removal of legacy records, raising alarms about data governance, audit integrity, and long-term institutional continuity. Thus far, DOGE has declined to respond to multiple FOIA requests or provide detailed documentation of these efforts, citing national security and cybersecurity exemptions. As oversight bodies begin to take notice, the opacity itself has become a warning sign.\n\nFinally, while DOGE insists their mission is public service, several technologists and policy staff we spoke with raised red flags about the expanding role of private contractors, especially high-profile firms like Palantir. Though not formally disclosed, report  suggest Palantir may be involved in early-stage backend integration or pilot analysis projects. If true, this marks a significant shift in how IRS data is governed and who has access to the informational backbone of the American tax system.\n\n\nWhat Real Reform Requires: Governance, Continuity, and Public Infrastructure\n\nThere’s no question that the IRS needs modernization. A progressive vision of IRS reform begins with a simple premise: public systems should be built to serve the public, not to impress venture capitalists or mimic the latest private-sector trends. That means modernization must be led by public interest technologists, not external disruptors with limited institutional knowledge and no stake in long-term stewardship. It also means investing in people, not just software. One of DOGE’s most dangerous moves has been to sideline or push out experienced IRS staff, including COBOL engineers and IT veterans who understand legacy systems' logic, dependencies, and vulnerabilities. These people are not relics. They are keepers of institutional memory, and any transition plan that ignores their insight risks erasing critical knowledge that cannot be recovered.\n\nModernization must also be incremental and dual-tracked. That means running new systems alongside old ones until full interoperability is confirmed. It requires building in redundancy, not stripping it out. It requires regulatory oversight, including privacy reviews, public documentation, and congressional reporting. And yes, it requires real money - multi-year funding, not patchwork grants or short-term political windfalls. Security concerns around COBOL are real, but they’re not insurmountable. Most are not about the language itself but about hardware constraints, vendor deprecation, and decades of deferred maintenance. TIGTA has noted that while COBOL systems present challenges, many vulnerabilities stem from funding shortfalls for patching and hardware upgrades, not the language itself. These are problems of political will, not just code architecture.","html":"<p><em>This is the second installment in the Notes on the Crises series on the IRS.

Besides, even if the DOGE’s access was technically limited, there are <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/treasury-secretary-bessents-lawlessness-sorry-readers-read-and-write-code-still-seems-in-play/\"><u>serious risks associated with this level of access</u></a>. The lack of transparency regarding data handling is particularly concerning, as staff have <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>reported</u></a> to Nathan Tankus from early on in the payments crisis that they have no designated authority left within the Treasury to whom they can safely report security protocol breaches.</p><p>While the Internal Revenue Code provides robust protections for taxpayer data through<a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/government-entities/federal-state-local-governments/disclosure-laws?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> <u>Section 6103</u></a>, which establishes confidentiality with strict penalties for violations and permits access and sharing only under <strong>specific, explicit circumstances</strong>, we cannot verify that DOGE officials comply with these rules. This oversight gap is especially troubling as they prepare to undertake their next ambitious project: a complete rewrite of legacy systems written in Assembly Code and COBOL - programming languages that form the foundation of many critical government functions.</p><h2 id=\"the-cobol-gambit\"><strong>The COBOL Gambit</strong></h2><p>It’s important to note that IRS modernization was underway long before DOGE arrived. The agency has spent years attempting to upgrade legacy systems and gradually phase out older programming languages like COBOL. What DOGE is attempting is not modernization in principle, but modernization at reckless speed, divorced from institutional knowledge and technical prudence.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hackathon-irs-data-palantir/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Wired Reporting</u></a> indicates an alarmingly naive plan to convert decades of critical COBOL code to Java through a 30-day “hackathon”, yet the true scope and timeline of this risky undertaking remain opaque. While the project's exact details are murky, their messaging suggests an unprecedented urgency in modernization efforts. In a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/doge-deputy-treasury-secretary-dish-crusade-pull-irs-out-its-really-big-hole?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>March FOX News appearance,</u></a> Sam Corcos (representing DOGE), alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant, launched<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/doge-deputy-treasury-secretary-dish-crusade-pull-irs-out-its-really-big-hole?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> targeted criticisms</a> of the IRS's legacy systems. Bessent <a href=\"https://x.com/SeccScotBessent/status/1925641077932904477?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>amplified</u></a> these claims,<a href=\"https://x.com/SeccScotBessent/status/1925641077932904477?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> declaring</a> on social media that the IRS modernization program lags 35 years behind schedule. Corcos is now a Treasury political appointee who serves as the agency’s Chief Information Officer. A career civil servant previously held that role.&nbsp;</p><p>This rushed rhetoric perfectly exemplifies DOGE's toxic combination of technical hubris and institutional recklessness. Despite repeated inquiries from oversight bodies and the press and urgent warnings from veteran civil servants, Treasury and the IRS maintain radio silence on the details of this unprecedented system overhaul, keeping taxpayers and Congress blind to changes that could potentially devastate America's tax infrastructure.</p><h2 id=\"a-history-of-%E2%80%9Cmodernization%E2%80%9D-and-what-we%E2%80%99ve-already-tried\"><strong>A History of “Modernization” and What We’ve Already Tried</strong></h2><p>Modernizing the IRS or any current government system is not a one-time software upgrade; it’s a multiyear institutional overhaul requiring stable funding, cross-agency coordination, and continuous technical labor. It also means maintaining dual systems for extended periods to ensure continuity for internal operations and taxpayer use, which is an expensive but necessary measure. What failed in the past wasn’t the vision of modernization but the refusal to consistently fund and maintain it. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), and the National Taxpayer Advocate have all stated the same thing for years: the IRS cannot modernize without multi-year, predictable investments.</p><p>GAO reports dating back to the early 2000s have flagged the absence of long-term funding as an impediment to the agency’s modernization goals. The National Taxpayer Advocate has echoed this repeatedly, noting in a 2019 <a href=\"https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ARC19_Volume1.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>report</u></a> that the IRS’s Business Systems Modernization program was delayed not by poor planning, but by the piecemeal and inconsistent nature of congressional appropriations. This is not a controversial opinion by any stretch. In fact, the private sector consistently emphasizes multi-year stable funding as a necessary condition for most projects, especially large-scale IT initiatives. There are many examples of multi-year stable funding being the prerequisite for success. JP Morgan invested over<a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/payments/acquiring-and-e-commerce/digitalization-a-strategic-priority?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> $12 billion</u></a> every year for many years, resulting in the successful modernization of legacy systems and the development of new digital banking platforms.</p><p>The IRS's technology investment funding has seen many ups and downs since Congress's establishment of the Information Technology Investment Account in FY 1997. These funding levels fall far short of what private companies spend on system improvements, despite government agencies serving millions more people and facing higher costs and consequences of service disruptions. The spending categories vary over the years, but we can consistently identify the Business Systems Modernization category that clearly shows fluctuating <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-costs-incurred-by-budget-activity-irs-data-book-table-32?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>modernization spending</u></a> between 2006 and 2022. Before the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding in 2023, business system modernization spending peaked at $468 million (2024 $) in 2011 and reached its lowest point at $309 million (2024 $) in 2018. Following the IRA allocation, spending increased dramatically to $926 million (2024 $) in 2023 and $1.3 billion (current $) in 2024 for system modernization, not including Direct File and certain other specific expenditures.</p><p><strong>Agency staff we interviewed</strong> recognized this need for stable multi-year funding. Many expressed appreciation for the increased IRA spending and advocated for ways to maintain higher funding levels even after the IRA funds expire, noting that this influx had been instrumental in advancing several critical projects. Despite these challenges and contrary to DOGE's positioning as pioneers in recognizing the IRS's technological needs, the reality is that the agency has been actively pursuing modernization for over six decades. As we said earlier, there have been mixed results, not because of government inertia but because of <strong>political neglect and chronic underfunding</strong>.</p><p>Beyond the funding and political challenges we discuss above, there is a fundamental misunderstanding about what IRS modernization entails - specifically, which aspects need modernization, the best path forward, and which elements have already been acknowledged and are being addressed versus what new components DOGE is introducing.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"what-does-modernizing-the-irs-entail\"><strong>What does modernizing the IRS entail?</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>At its core, IRS modernization represents an overhaul of technical infrastructure and taxpayer services. This approach addresses both internal operations and public-facing capabilities. Like many other organizations with legacy systems, the IRS faced a major IT challenge: the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/fs-99-07.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Y2K project</u></a> - a massive undertaking to address the problem with the year 2000. This issue stemmed from the way dates were stored in computer systems, using two digits for the year instead of four, which meant that when the calendar turned to 2000, systems might interpret \"00\" as 1900 rather than 2000. A more recent example of modernization effort on the public-facing side is the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/filing/irs-direct-file-for-free?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Direct File</u></a>, which was launched as a pilot program in 2024 to offer eligible taxpayers a free, government-provided tax filing option that simplifies the process and eliminates the need for third-party software.</p><p>But for the most part, the IRS has focused on modernizing its core infrastructure by gradually replacing COBOL and Assembly Language Code systems, especially within the Individual Master File (IMF). The IMF is the oldest operating database in the federal government, conceptualized in 1959 and developed in <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/newsroom/irs-history-timeline_march-2019.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>1962</u></a> using Assembly Language Code and COBOL. IMF remains the authoritative system for tracking every individual taxpayer’s account activity: income, credits, payments, and refunds. Legacy systems written in COBOL and Assembly Language—many still operational—form the backbone of tax processing infrastructure. While DOGE officials claim to be replacing Assembly code with Java, COBOL-based systems were reportedly being migrated to new compilers or systems known as RM/COBOL which was also being implemented at the <a href=\"https://oig.treasury.gov/system/files/2024-11/oig25005%20%28508%29.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Bureau of the Fiscal Service</u></a>. A major advantage of RM/COBOLis that it makes the code platform agnostic, allowing it to run on platforms other than large powerful computing systems such as mainframes. To be clear, the details that have come out about DOGE’s efforts are murky and contradictory while it is difficult to get clarity on what exactly they are either doing, or even claiming to do.</p><p>The IRS has been <a href=\"https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF12525.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">planning and implementing</a> a transition away from the original COBOL for over 20 years. That initiative, known as the Customer Account Data Engine (CADE), was launched in 2000 to replace the IMF and deliver a faster, more flexible system that could support real-time processing. According to a <a href=\"https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF12525.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>2024 Congressional Research Service Report</u></a>, CADE 1 ran into early trouble - delays, vendor issues, scope creep - and was shelved in 2009. Its successor, CADE 2, showed more promise but stalled, slowed by unstable funding and shifting political priorities.&nbsp; Nevertheless, progress has occurred. According to a<u> </u><a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106566.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>GAO report</u></a><u> from March 2023</u>, the IRS had completed major components of the Individual Tax Processing Engine and was preparing CADE 2 for broader testing.&nbsp;</p><p>These achievements remain partial, however, as modernization requires more than a one-time software upgrade. While DOGE may present this process as merely inefficient and project that they can do this better in a much shorter time, <strong>that is likely impossible</strong>. The IRS systems involve layers of complexities that come with operating at such a scale. There are intricate issues that require years of institutional knowledge - intimate understanding of the system in the context of the IRS and not just the expert technical know-how that some DOGE staffers may possess.</p><p>As Nathan has<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"> covered</a> in his previous <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>reporting</u></a> on the Treasury payments system, the complexity of COBOL systems is widely misunderstood in general discourse and within modern tech industries. He explains: \"The issue with understanding and grasping a COBOL system is not knowing COBOL, as a programming language, in the abstract... The issue is understanding the specific physical limitations of the system, the way that it interacts with the 'Business Logic' of the code, and a million other contextual factors.\" This shows why contextual and institutional knowledge is crucial. Modernizing these COBOL systems requires more than mere language syntax fluency. These systems <strong>have developed intricate internal business logics that constitute vital institutional knowledge</strong>. Consequently, retaining engineers and staff who possess this knowledge and can train new engineers familiar with COBOL is an integral part of any successful modernization process.</p><p>Why this contextual knowledge matters is easily exemplified by the story behind a widespread misconception about social security beneficiaries. Contrary to claims<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891557463377490431?lang=en&ref=crisesnotes.com\"> <u>amplified</u></a> by Elon Musk, thousands of deceased individuals are not receiving benefits. The reality is far more mundane: early COBOL dialects handled null values poorly, so when someone applied for social security with a missing birth date, engineers implemented a specific date as a placeholder. They chose <a href=\"https://news.stthomas.edu/in-the-news-manjeet-rege-on-the-computer-programming-language-used-by-the-social-security-administration/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>May 20, 1875</u></a> - the anniversary of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures' creation. Thus, while records might appear to show 150-year-old people receiving payments, the reality is entirely different and far less sensational. Yet, as <em>Notes on the Crises</em> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-crisis-at-social-security-illustrates-elon-musk-and-doges-plan-explode-the-number-and-severity-of-improper-payments/\"><u>covered in late April</u></a>, these misconceptions have had profound consequences as DOGE moved millions of people to Social Security Administration’s “Death Master File”</p><p>This context of <strong>chronic and inconsistent funding</strong>, as well as the <strong>need for institutional knowledge</strong>, matters. DOGE now positions itself as the savior of an intentionally starved system. However, they’re doing so without the <strong>humility or historical understanding that modernization requires</strong>.</p><p>The challenges of modernization are not limited to external factors.<strong> IRS career staff we spoke with described a deep internal tension</strong>: while many recognize the agency’s outdated infrastructure, they’ve also grown wary, if not defensive, about change. This defensiveness isn’t irrational. The civil service has kept the IRS running despite a decades-long war of attrition, where budget cuts and political attacks have left it operating under siege. Staff described a churn of political appointees at Treasury arriving every few years, launching ambitious reform plans, and then departing before implementation, leaving half-built systems and institutional fatigue in their wake.</p><p>This constant disruption has created a culture that <strong>prizes internal stability, process, and procedure</strong>,&nbsp; sometimes to a fault. As some staff acknowledged, parts of the agency have accumulated administrative bloat and redundancies over time, not <strong>because of modernization but due to the uneven political targeting of different IRS functions</strong>. Over the past few decades, enforcement divisions, taxpayer assistance programs, and IT infrastructure have all faced rolling waves of political scrutiny and budget cuts, while other areas remained untouched. This has created a patchwork organizational structure, where some offices are understaffed, while others carry redundant roles that once served as safeguards against chronic instability.&nbsp;</p><p>This raises a deeper question: if the IRS is essential political infrastructure and central to the functioning of the entire fiscal state, should it be subject to annual political fights over appropriations at all? Modernization can’t succeed if it remains hostage to short-term political cycles. What’s needed is structural commitment: stable funding, institutional continuity, and governance mechanisms that treat the IRS not as a punching bag, but as core democratic infrastructure. DOGE’s narrative ignores decades of defunded effort, bureaucratic workarounds, and congressional gridlock and pretends modernization failure was solely a product of technical incompetence rather than political constraint.</p><h2 id=\"lessons-from-the-va-the-1985-tax-season-and-doge%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cmunchable%E2%80%9D-debacle\"><strong>Lessons from the VA, the 1985 Tax Season, and DOGE’s “MUNCHABLE” Debacle</strong></h2><p>Modernization done right is incremental, transparent, and cautious. One of the clearest historical lessons comes from the IRS itself. In 1985, a rushed update to its computing system caused one of the worst tax seasons in U.S. history. Refunds were delayed for months. Erroneous notices were mailed to millions of Americans. Lines at local IRS offices stretched out the door. Congress was flooded with constituent complaints, and the crisis led to a series of internal audits and public hearings. That episode became known as the <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/5248369-a-warning-from-1985-the-tax-season-from-hell/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><strong><u>tax season from hell</u></strong></a><strong>.”</strong> It was a cautionary tale about the risks of rushed reform - an example of how modernization without governance can backfire.&nbsp;</p><p>Recent events at other agencies have already demonstrated the dangers of hasty implementation. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, a DOGE staffer rapidly developed an AI tool to identify supposedly \"non-essential\" private company services, labeling them as \"MUNCHABLE.\" This resulted in the termination of nearly 600 contracts. When confronted about the errors, the DOGE staffer dismissed concerns, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-doge-veterans-affairs-ai-contracts-health-care?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>telling</u> </a>ProPublica, \"I’m sure mistakes were made. Mistakes are always made.\" The consequences of this cavalier approach proved severe. Among the terminated contracts were truly essential services, including maintenance for a gene sequencing device crucial for cancer treatment research, blood sample analysis for VA research projects, and tools designed to enhance nursing care quality.</p><p>With DOGE’s entrance into the IRS, the specter of <strong>catastrophic system-wide failure certainly looms large</strong>. The cautionary tale of 1985 still haunts the IRS. Given today's exponentially more complex tax systems and transaction volumes, DOGE's aggressive timeline and contempt for institutional knowledge could trigger a meltdown that <strong>makes 1985 look like a minor glitch</strong>.&nbsp; IRS staff <strong>we interviewed described the MUNCHABLE episode as a “canary in the coal mine”</strong> for what could happen if similar tools were unleashed on taxpayer data or IRS operations.</p><p>The IRS cannot afford such recklessness. A single misstep in the system that processes refunds, verifies identity, or tracks withholding could delay paychecks, trigger false audits, or compromise vast swaths of sensitive personal data. DOGE’s insistence on speed and dismissal of internal IRS expertise doesn’t just increase the risk of failure. It makes failure all but inevitable.</p><p>Meanwhile, additional risks have emerged around DOGE’s broader digital ambitions. Multiple sources flagged DOGE’s parallel effort to develop a “<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hackathon-irs-data-palantir/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>mega API”</u></a> - a centralized interface intended to integrate IRS data with other federal databases. While framed as an efficiency tool, staff expressed alarm that it could enable cross-agency data sharing without adequate safeguards, including possible tracking of migrant populations, nonprofit activity, and union operations. These concerns echo broader patterns in administrative surveillance, where <strong>modernization rhetoric has historically masked new capacities for control</strong>. There are also growing concerns from staff about <strong>undocumented system changes and the possible removal of legacy records</strong>, raising alarms about data governance, audit integrity, and long-term institutional continuity. Thus far, DOGE has declined to respond to multiple FOIA requests or provide detailed documentation of these efforts, citing national security and cybersecurity exemptions. As oversight bodies begin to take notice, the opacity itself has become a warning sign.</p><p>Finally, while DOGE insists their mission is public service, several technologists and policy staff we spoke with raised red flags about the expanding role of private contractors, especially high-profile firms like Palantir. Though not formally disclosed, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-doge-irs-mega-api-data/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>report</u></a>&nbsp; suggest Palantir may be involved in early-stage backend integration or pilot analysis projects. If true, this marks a significant shift in how IRS data is governed and who has access to the informational backbone of the American tax system.</p><h2 id=\"what-real-reform-requires-governance-continuity-and-public-infrastructure\"><strong>What Real Reform Requires: Governance, Continuity, and Public Infrastructure</strong></h2><p>There’s no question that the IRS needs modernization. A progressive vision of IRS reform begins with a simple premise: public systems should be built to serve the public, not to impress venture capitalists or mimic the latest private-sector trends. That means modernization must be led by public interest technologists, not external disruptors with limited institutional knowledge and no stake in long-term stewardship. It also means investing in people, not just software. One of DOGE’s most dangerous moves has been to sideline or push out experienced IRS staff, including COBOL engineers and IT veterans who understand legacy systems' logic, dependencies, and vulnerabilities. These people are not relics. They are keepers of institutional memory, and any transition plan that ignores their insight risks erasing critical knowledge that cannot be recovered.</p><p>Modernization must also be incremental and dual-tracked. That means running new systems alongside old ones until full interoperability is confirmed. It requires building in redundancy, not stripping it out. It requires regulatory oversight, including privacy reviews, public documentation, and congressional reporting. And yes, it requires real money - multi-year funding, not patchwork grants or short-term political windfalls. Security concerns around COBOL are real, but they’re not insurmountable. Most are not about the language itself but about hardware constraints, vendor deprecation, and decades of deferred maintenance. TIGTA has noted that while COBOL systems present challenges, many vulnerabilities stem from funding shortfalls for patching and hardware upgrades, not the language itself. These are problems of political will, not just code architecture.</p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/inside-doges-dangerously-hasty-irs-modernization-plan/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"b36a8bd6-4f96-4934-ab21-63ccaae0fe31","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"68648d9e1693c60001ba646e","reading_time":14}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"June 12","id":"Ghost__Post__684a7989b3542f0001f70a51","title":"The Fiscal State Under Siege: Why People Hate the IRS, and Why You Should Care","slug":"the-fiscal-state-under-siege-why-people-hate-the-irs-and-why-you-should-care","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/06/IRS-series-1.png","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b80808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/dd075/IRS-series-1.png","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/715a6/IRS-series-1.png 398w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/fc129/IRS-series-1.png 796w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/dd075/IRS-series-1.png 1592w","sizes":"(min-width: 1592px) 1592px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/530b5/IRS-series-1.webp 398w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/a621f/IRS-series-1.webp 796w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/09728/IRS-series-1.webp 1592w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1592px) 1592px, 100vw"}]},"width":1592,"height":830}}},"excerpt":"How Trump, DOGE, and Project 2025 Are Turning the IRS Into a Tool of Authoritarian Rule\n\n\n\nEditor’s Introduction: Hello readers, it's Nathan Tankus and I am very happy to bring to you the first in a long multi-part series on the IRS spearheaded by Anisha Steephen.

And I love taxes. From mid-2021 through January 2025, I worked at the U.S. Treasury. Among many roles during my time there, I spent some time in the Office of Tax Policy, where I helped implement the tax provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. This is the first in a Notes on the Crises series that I, along with others, will be tackling about the IRS and taxes. In the weeks ahead, we’ll explore the agency transformation and the House Republicans’ disastrous reconciliation package that is unfolding right now. But first, we have to understand what taxation is — and why it’s always been about power. What’s below is an overview, then we will go in depth on many aspects as the series evolves. \n\n\nProject 2025 and the Structural Takeover\n\nIf you’ve read Project 2025, you know there was a plan. The authors laid out a blueprint to bring the IRS under greater executive control by infiltrating political appointees, gutting the civil service, and pushing an ambitious slate of regressive tax policies through Congress.\n\nWell, it’s happening.\n\nThe first public signal of chaos at the IRS came on February 17 when the Associated Press reported that DOGE was seeking access to the IRS’s Integrated Data Retrieval System—one of the most sensitive (I would argue the most sensitive) databases of personal information in the federal government. Privacy experts and lawmakers immediately sounded the alarm that this was no ordinary tech integration. It was a structural takeover.\n\nSince then, the chaos has only multiplied to include leadership purges, workforce cuts, and a DOGE-hosted IRS “hackathon.” These aren’t isolated incidents. They reflect a strategic campaign to transform the IRS into a politically partisan enforcement mechanism and a lever of executive power. \n\nThis goes far beyond just administrative disorder that is expected with any administration change, which would be concerning enough on its own. This is a systematic takeover of the federal government’s fiscal core. What’s at stake is not only the architecture of how the state sees, collects, and allocates public resources, but whether a functioning democracy can survive without it.\n\n\nWhy the IRS Matters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IRS sits at the center of the federal government’s fiscal architecture. As the financial nexus between the state and its residents, it facilitates the movement of trillions of dollars through the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. It enforces tax law, detects fraud, and has the authority to audit the ultra-wealthy to crack down on tax evasion that enables them to become even richer. The IRS does not write tax law, but enforces the code passed by Congress. Confusing the IRS with the architects of tax policy lets lawmakers off the hook. Its role is administrative, not factional, and that’s precisely what makes it so powerful. \n\nBut its role goes deeper. The IRS is not merely a tool of extraction: it can be a mechanism for redistribution, stabilization, and democratic investment. In Fiscal Year 2024, the IRS collected $4.9 trillion in taxes, which comprised 96% of total government revenue and was equivalent to 17% of GDP that year. When governed with public purpose, the IRS powers the fiscal machinery that sustains democracy itself by facilitating the spending that funds housing, healthcare, climate action, education, and income support that reaches millions. For example, In 2021 the IRS delivered over $100 billion in expanded Child Tax Credit payments. \n\nAt the beginning of this piece, when I say I love the IRS and taxes, I'm referring to these core social responsibilities, not to institutional permanence or bureaucratic tradition. The IRS is a vital institution, but it is not above critique. Studying it is essential, yet we must resist the impulse toward institutional reverence. This is especially important now, as agencies like the IRS grow increasingly susceptible to authoritarian encroachment. These institutions are not immutable moral authorities; they are only as democratic as the political forces that shape and control them.\n\nTo control the IRS is to control the operating system of the American state. That is precisely what makes this moment so dangerous. DOGE isn’t simply trying to dismantle the agency. It is trying to capture and rewire the IRS into a vehicle for executive dominance, privatized tax enforcement, and algorithmic control over public infrastructure. \n\nThis is not about eliminating bureaucracy, fraud, waste, or abuse. It’s about repurposing it to serve a new model of power and breaking the chain of democratic accountability between Congress, the law, and the public.  \n\n\nWhat Taxes Actually Are (And Why They’ve Always Been About Power and Control)\n\nTaxes are often portrayed as technocratic minutiae of statecraft—matters best left to accountants, economists, and congressional scorekeepers. But in truth, they are the lifeblood of state power.\n\nIn theory, taxes facilitate the provision of public goods and services: everything from national defense and infrastructure to schools and our social safety nets. Taxes come in many forms, including income taxes (on wages, salaries, and capital gains), consumption taxes (such as sales and excise taxes), property taxes, and corporate taxes. Taxes may be direct or indirect, progressive or regressive, visible or embedded in prices. No matter how they’re designed, taxes define the boundaries between the state and its people and the contours of political life. They determine who owes what to whom, and who gets to decide.\n\nThroughout history, taxation has functioned not merely as a means to help resource the government but as an instrument of visibility and control. Political theorist James C. Scott argued that states are often more motivated to tax in order to render societies legible in order to govern. Tax systems compel individuals to make themselves known to the state: declaring income, disclosing assets, and proving eligibility for social benefits. In doing so, they map economic life and assign political meaning to it. Taxes and tax policies create the conditions under which labor is counted, whose wealth is protected, and whose lives are monitored, audited, or excluded.\n\nPolitical economists have long recognized this dual function. Adam Smith, in The Wealth of Nations, emphasized that the sovereign’s survival depended on the ability to raise taxes efficiently and equitably. Marx saw taxation as one of many battlefields where class conflict played out over the distribution of social surplus. In the turmoil of the twentieth century, John Maynard Keynes emphasized taxation was- or could be- a tool for macroeconomic stabilization.  Piketty, working in the twenty-first century, warns that progressive taxation is essential to preventing the return of entrenched oligarchies. Legal realist Robert Hale, writing in the 1920s, argued that all income and property rights are upheld through coercive legal rules—and therefore taxation is not an intrusion on freedom but a foundational mechanism by which the state structures economic life. Even libertarians, though begrudgingly, concede taxation’s necessity to facilitate minimal state functions. These views span ideological terrain, but converge on one point: taxation is not merely math. It is a political infrastructure. It is how the state exercises power, asserts authority, and signals its priorities. In short, it is governance in its most distilled form.\n\n\nThe State’s Obligation to Its People \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxation defines what the state can see and, by extension, what it can control. In a democracy, that visibility is supposed to be reciprocal. If the state can see you, you should be able to shape what the state does in return. That mutual recognition is the only viable foundation of our social contract with the State. The American Colonists in their revolution understood this intuitively. Their demand was not against taxation itself, but against taxation without representation—a refusal to cede fiscal power to distant, unaccountable authorities. The colonists clashed with their British imperial counterparts and insisted that taxation be tethered to the democratic voice.\n\nAnd yet, U.S. tax policy has long prioritized extraction over equity. In its early years, the republic relied heavily on regressive tariffs—taxes on imported goods that disproportionately burdened consumers, especially the poor, while shielding elites. For example, the 1790s federal revenue system was primarily concentrated on duties for goods like sugar, salt, and textiles, staples that made up a large share of working-class consumption. Meanwhile, wealthy landowners and merchants, who benefited from domestic production and trade, paid little by comparison.\n\nEfforts to create a more equitable fiscal order, like those proposed by Thomas Paine, were largely ignored. Paine, recognizing the dangers of concentrated wealth, advocated for what we would now call a wealth tax: a 100% marginal tax on estates above a certain threshold. In his view, taxation was not just an instrument of state power—it was a means to dismantle economic hierarchy and protect political equality. The Civil War briefly disrupted the tradition of regressive taxation. The Union introduced the first federal income tax, an extraordinary expansion of the Treasury’s infrastructure and fiscal capacity. The ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 made that authority permanent, embedding the principle that those who benefit most from the economic system should contribute proportionally to its upkeep. In theory, it marked a new democratic fiscal compact.\n\nBut in practice, that compact has always been contested by the elite. The U.S. tax system has long operated as a machine of selective visibility. Today, working-class Americans are subject to invasive scrutiny. They must document their income, family structure, and eligibility for basic social benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit. Meanwhile, the wealthy conceal assets in trusts, shell corporations, and offshore accounts. This asymmetry is not accidental: it is a structural feature of the fiscal state, built on political choices about who must be accountable and who is allowed to remain invisible. Taxation, in this system, reinforces hierarchies of obligation where the poor are tethered to bureaucratic surveillance, while the rich rig the system to float above it.\n\nThat class betrayal extends beyond the collection of taxes to how the Federal Government’s budget is designed. While working-class communities are urged to see tax paying as a civic virtue, they receive little in return. The essential services that taxes are (in theory) meant to make possible—public education, housing, and healthcare—remain systematically underinvested. At the same time, public dollars finance militarized policing, mass incarceration, and global warfare. For many Black and brown Americans, paying taxes means giving up purchasing power while governments, corporations, and the wealthy use this country’s fiscal apparatus to sustain a bureaucratic machinery of broader oppression and marginalization. The fiscal system doesn’t just deepen state control over daily life—it entangles citizens in state violence, without offering them protection in return.\n\nThis is why debates over tax policy are never just about money, and why more people should be paying attention. They are about visibility, legitimacy, and power—about who the government chooses to see, to trust, and ultimately, to protect or to punish. The IRS, then, in its role administering tax policy, is not and has never been a neutral bureaucratic entity. It is the institutional expression of political economy—a mechanism that enforces who must justify their presence in the fiscal order. Its failures reflect political choices, but so do its successes. When aligned with democratic goals, the IRS can function as a pillar of economic justice, making visible the invisible, delivering benefits directly to the people, and ensuring that those who extract the most from society contribute their fair share.\n\nTaxation is therefore not just a tool of technocratic administration; it is the terrain of democratic struggle. And while that struggle has always been fraught, today it is perilous. \n\n\nThe IRS and Its Current Political Transformation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IRS, as the institution that we know, took shape during the Civil War, but its modern incarnation grew alongside the rise of the 20th-century administrative state. As federal responsibilities expanded, so did the need for an agency capable of managing the government’s most powerful claim over its citizens: the power to tax. Over the decades, the IRS became both an indispensable and a deeply resented bureaucratic punching bag for anti-government sentiment. Though often blamed for the tax system’s outcomes, the IRS does not write the rules—it enforces the tax code passed by Congress. This administrative role makes it structurally nonpartisan, yet politically vulnerable.\n\nThe IRS is not just another federal agency. It is supposed to enforce tax laws impartially based on statutes passed by Congress. That mandate was tested—and violated—during the Nixon administration. In the early 1970s, President Nixon ordered the IRS to audit his political opponents, civil rights activists, and journalists, weaponizing the agency for personal and ideological retaliation. The resulting scandal led to the creation of Section 7217 of the Internal Revenue Code, which explicitly prohibits executive branch officials, including the president, from interfering in IRS audits or administration. This firewall was designed to safeguard the agency’s independence and, by extension, the democratic legitimacy of the tax system itself.\n\nHowever, the assault on the IRS did not end with Nixon. In the decades that followed, it became a central target of conservative movements intent on dismantling the federal state. The Reagan era marked a turning point. As the gospel of small government and supply-side economics took hold, efforts to defund, discredit, and destabilize the IRS intensified. The 1990s brought relentless anti-tax rhetoric, and the 2010s delivered defunding and institutional decline. Between 2010 and 2022, Congress slashed the IRS budget by over 20%, leading to the loss of more than 20,000 employees (including auditors, investigators, and IT specialists) as basic customer service collapsed under the weight of chronic understaffing.\n\nIn that same period, enforcement against the wealthy all but virtually disappeared. According to economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the top 1% of U.S. earners evaded roughly $160 billion in taxes annually.  Meanwhile, audits of low-income taxpayers, especially those claiming refundable credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit, surged. A 2023 Quarterly Journal of Economics study, using IRS data from 2010 to 2018, found that Black taxpayers were audited at nearly five times the rate of non-Black taxpayers. This wasn’t because they were more likely to commit fraud, but because their returns were simpler and cheaper to audit. During years of budget cuts, the IRS leaned on algorithms that prioritized efficiency over fairness. The result was a classist and racialized audit and enforcement system built for speed and to protect the wealthy. \n\nThe Biden administration hoped to reverse course by restoring the IRS’s capacity to serve the public. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 secured nearly $80 billion in new funding aimed at modernizing technology, rebuilding the workforce, and ensuring that tax enforcement was applied to the wealthy as well as the poor. The New York Times recently reported that the IRS upheld Biden’s pledge to increase audits but only on the wealthy. Those efforts have now largely been halted.\n\nThese decades of targeting the IRS weren’t just an attack on one agency. They were an attack on the state’s ability to govern fairly. A well-resourced IRS is more than a bureaucratic necessity; it is democratic infrastructure. It enables the equal enforcement of the law, the redistribution of wealth, and the delivery of public goods. Fiscal fairness becomes impossible when that capacity is gutted, and democracy becomes performative. The IRS wasn’t neglected by conservatives: it has been meticulously redesigned to concentrate power and wealth along lines of class and race. Its mission was retooled to be less a guardian of the public interest and more a servant of market discipline. \n\nAnd today, that project is entering a new and far more dangerous phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump, DOGE,  and the New Model of Fiscal Control\n\nUnder the Trump administration, DOGE has aggressively intervened in the IRS by seeking access to sensitive taxpayer data, orchestrating mass layoffs, and eliminating public-friendly programs like Direct File. They don’t want to just dismantle the IRS. They want to further rewire it, transforming a civic institution into a political instrument. In this vision, taxation is no longer a shared obligation but a mechanism of ideological enforcement. Surveillance becomes the method, and loyalty to the president the metric. This transformation is rooted in the logic of new public management—a technocratic framework that reshapes public institutions to resemble private firms: lean, automated, data-driven, and detached from democratic accountability. \n\nThis shift doesn’t just weaken the IRS. It bypasses the democratic infrastructure that’s supposed to govern it. What was once a chain of accountability—from lawmaking to enforcement to public benefit—is now being rerouted through executive command and algorithmic control. Under this model, the IRS ceases to be a steward of fiscal democracy and instead morphs into an engine of information extraction: surveilling the public, enforcing hierarchy, and concentrating power.\n\nThe consequences are already visible: the IRS’s agreement to share confidential taxpayer data with ICE has raised alarms about privacy and the agency's role in enforcement beyond taxation; and the threatened revocations of nonprofit status for universities, climate organizations, and racial justice groups—justified under the guise of fiscal scrutiny—are not neutral acts of enforcement. They are party-focused interventions, using the tax code to intimidate critics and constrain dissent. \n\nWe’ve seen this before, and it should scare us. In countries like Hungary and Rwanda, governments have turned tax authorities into instruments of repression—not by banning civil society outright, but by burying it in audits, compliance demands, and legal ambiguity. Bureaucratic coercion becomes a substitute for overt censorship. The United States is now testing the contours of that same strategy: deploying regulatory pressure to erode opposition, cloaking political retaliation in administrative form, and transforming fiscal policy into a weapon of ideological discipline.\n\nWhat’s also being lost in all of this is not just IRS institutional expertise or workforce capacity. It’s the legitimacy of the social contract: the idea that taxation is a collective democratic function. DOGE’s approach echoes a system where data is extracted not to serve the public, but to entrench private and executive power. In this framework, the IRS no longer upholds civic duty, but instead enforces obedience. Public authority remains, but democratic accountability disappears.\n\n\nIf You Control the Tax Code and the IRS, You Control the State and The People\n\nThis isn’t just bureaucratic reshuffling. It’s a battle over the very structure of American democracy. The IRS, as the engine of fiscal governance, is being gutted, rewired, and weaponized. While Congress still (in theory) formally holds the power of the purse, control over how tax laws are enforced and against whom is increasingly shifting to the executive branch. And the tax code, once a tool for potential shared investment, is being further entrenched as a shield for elite impunity.\n\nIf a sitting president can direct the IRS to investigate political enemies, revoke nonprofit status from dissenting institutions, or selectively enforce tax law to reward loyalty, the agency no longer serves the public. It serves power. The slow hollowing of the IRS through funding cuts, staff attrition, and the erosion of norms yields the same result: a weakened institution unable to enforce the law, uphold equity, or hold the powerful to account.\n\nAnd when that happens, the disparities baked into our fiscal system deepen. The rich, already shielded by armies of tax lawyers and offshore vehicles, become even more invisible to enforcement. Meanwhile, the working class, especially Black and brown taxpayers, are subject to increased scrutiny and bureaucratic punishment. When Nixon overstepped, Congress stepped in. But today, a deeply polarized legislature, decades of executive aggrandizement, and a judiciary increasingly deferential to presidential authority have eroded those checks. Now the stakes are higher, not just because of the power being wielded, but because of whom that power targets and whom it protects.\n\nWe are no longer just watching a system decay. We are watching it be consolidated to serve private power, silence dissent, and reverse the very idea of democratic taxation. It’s a constitutional breakdown. If the IRS falls, we won’t just lose an agency; we’ll lose one of the last institutional expressions of democratic obligation. Taxation is not just how we keep a number of key infrastructures running—it is how we declare what we value, who we protect, and who must answer to the public. The IRS reflects that social contract, however imperfectly, and not without deep bias. But unlike some other federal institutions, its mandate remains tenuously anchored in public law and congressional oversight. It is one of the few places where the struggle over fiscal accountability is still active and, for now, structurally possible.\n\nWe don’t need to defend what the IRS has been. We need to fight for what it could be: a mechanism of equity, not control by the elite. And accountability, not surveillance. But if we allow it to collapse—or worse, to be captured for authoritarianism—we may wake up in a country where taxation still exists, but democracy does not.","html":"<h2 id=\"how-trump-doge-and-project-2025-are-turning-the-irs-into-a-tool-of-authoritarian-rule\">How Trump, DOGE, and Project 2025 Are Turning the IRS Into a Tool of Authoritarian Rule</h2><p></p><p><em>Editor’s Introduction: Hello readers, it's Nathan Tankus and I am very happy to bring to you the first in a long multi-part series on the IRS spearheaded by Anisha Steephen.

Legal realist Robert Hale, writing in the 1920s, argued that all income and property rights are upheld through coercive legal rules—and therefore taxation is not an intrusion on freedom but a foundational mechanism by which the state structures economic life. Even libertarians, though begrudgingly, concede taxation’s necessity to facilitate minimal state functions. These views span ideological terrain, but converge on one point: taxation is not merely math. It is a political infrastructure. It is how the state exercises power, asserts authority, and signals its priorities. In short, it is governance in its most distilled form.</p><h3 id=\"the-state%E2%80%99s-obligation-to-its-people\"><strong>The State’s Obligation to Its People&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-grey kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Buy a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>Taxation defines what the state can see and, by extension, what it can control. In a democracy, that visibility is supposed to be reciprocal. If the state can see you, you should be able to shape what the state does in return. That mutual recognition is the only viable foundation of our social contract with the State. The American Colonists in their revolution understood this intuitively. Their demand was not against taxation itself, but against taxation <em>without representation</em>—a refusal to cede fiscal power to distant, unaccountable authorities. The colonists clashed with their British imperial counterparts and insisted that taxation be tethered to the democratic voice.</p><p>And yet, U.S. tax policy has long prioritized extraction over equity. In its early years, the republic relied heavily on regressive tariffs—taxes on imported goods that disproportionately burdened consumers, especially the poor, while shielding elites. For example, the 1790s federal revenue system was primarily concentrated on duties for goods like sugar, salt, and textiles, staples that made up a large share of working-class consumption. Meanwhile, wealthy landowners and merchants, who benefited from domestic production and trade, paid little by comparison.</p><p>Efforts to create a more equitable fiscal order, like those proposed by Thomas Paine, were largely ignored. Paine, recognizing the dangers of concentrated wealth, advocated for what we would now call a wealth tax: a 100% marginal tax on estates above a certain threshold. In his view, taxation was not just an instrument of state power—it was a means to dismantle economic hierarchy and protect political equality. The Civil War briefly disrupted the tradition of regressive taxation. The Union introduced the first federal income tax, an extraordinary expansion of the Treasury’s infrastructure and fiscal capacity. The ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 made that authority permanent, embedding the principle that those who benefit most from the economic system should contribute proportionally to its upkeep. In theory, it marked a new democratic fiscal compact.</p><p>But in practice, that compact has always been contested by the elite. The U.S. tax system has long operated as a machine of <em>selective visibility</em>. Today, working-class Americans are subject to invasive scrutiny. They must document their income, family structure, and eligibility for basic social benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit. Meanwhile, the wealthy conceal assets in trusts, shell corporations, and offshore accounts. This asymmetry is not accidental: it is a structural feature of the fiscal state, built on political choices about who must be accountable and who is allowed to remain invisible. Taxation, in this system, reinforces hierarchies of obligation where the poor are tethered to bureaucratic surveillance, while the rich rig the system to float above it.</p><p>That class betrayal extends beyond the collection of taxes to how the Federal Government’s budget is designed. While working-class communities are urged to see tax paying as a civic virtue, they receive little in return. The essential services that taxes are (in theory) meant to make possible—public education, housing, and healthcare—remain systematically underinvested. At the same time, public dollars finance militarized policing, mass incarceration, and global warfare. For many Black and brown Americans, paying taxes means giving up purchasing power while governments, corporations, and the wealthy use this country’s fiscal apparatus to sustain a bureaucratic machinery of broader oppression and marginalization. The fiscal system doesn’t just deepen state control over daily life—it entangles citizens in state violence, without offering them protection in return.</p><p>This is why debates over tax policy are never just about money, and why more people should be paying attention. They are about visibility, legitimacy, and power—about who the government chooses to see, to trust, and ultimately, to protect or to punish. The IRS, then, in its role administering tax policy, is not and has never been a neutral bureaucratic entity. It is the institutional expression of political economy—a mechanism that enforces who must justify their presence in the fiscal order. Its failures reflect political choices, but so do its successes. When aligned with democratic goals, the IRS can function as a pillar of economic justice, making visible the invisible, delivering benefits directly to the people, and ensuring that those who extract the most from society contribute their fair share.</p><p>Taxation is therefore not just a tool of technocratic administration; <em>it is the terrain of democratic struggle.</em> And while that struggle has always been fraught, today it is perilous.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"the-irs-and-its-current-political-transformation\"><strong>The IRS and Its Current Political Transformation</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-grey kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Buy a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>The IRS, as the institution that we know, took shape during the Civil War, but its modern incarnation grew alongside the rise of the 20th-century administrative state. As federal responsibilities expanded, so did the need for an agency capable of managing the government’s most powerful claim over its citizens: <strong>the power to tax.</strong> Over the decades, the IRS became both an indispensable and a deeply resented bureaucratic punching bag for anti-government sentiment. Though often blamed for the tax system’s outcomes, the IRS does not write the rules—it enforces the tax code passed by Congress. This administrative role makes it structurally nonpartisan, yet politically vulnerable.</p><p>The IRS is not just another federal agency. It is supposed to enforce tax laws impartially based on statutes passed by Congress. That mandate was tested—and violated—during the Nixon administration. In the early 1970s, President Nixon ordered the IRS to audit his political opponents, civil rights activists, and journalists, weaponizing the agency for personal and ideological retaliation. The resulting scandal led to the creation of Section 7217 of the Internal Revenue Code, which explicitly prohibits executive branch officials, including the president, from interfering in IRS audits or administration. This firewall was designed to safeguard the agency’s independence and, by extension, the democratic legitimacy of the tax system itself.</p><p>However, the assault on the IRS did not end with Nixon. In the decades that followed, it became a central target of conservative movements intent on dismantling the federal state. The Reagan era marked a turning point. As the gospel of small government and supply-side economics took hold, efforts to defund, discredit, and destabilize the IRS intensified. The 1990s brought relentless anti-tax rhetoric, and the 2010s delivered defunding and institutional decline. Between 2010 and 2022, Congress <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-irs-was-gutted?ref=crisesnotes.com#:~:text=administration%20of%20Barack%20Obama%2C%20the,Collections%20rebounded\"><u>slashed</u></a> the IRS budget by over 20%, leading to the loss of more than 20,000 employees (including auditors, investigators, and IT specialists) as basic customer service collapsed under the weight of chronic understaffing.</p><p>In that same period, enforcement against the wealthy all but virtually disappeared. According to economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the top 1% of U.S. earners evaded roughly $160 billion in taxes annually.&nbsp; Meanwhile, audits of low-income taxpayers, especially those claiming refundable credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit, surged. A 2023 <em>Quarterly Journal of Economics</em> study, using IRS data from 2010 to 2018, <a href=\"https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/working-paper/measuring-and-mitigating-racial-disparities-tax-audits?ref=crisesnotes.com#:~:text=novel%20partial%20identification%20strategy%20to,%282%29%20targeting%20erroneously%20claimed\"><u>found</u></a> that Black taxpayers were audited at nearly five times the rate of non-Black taxpayers. This wasn’t because they were more likely to commit fraud, but because their returns were simpler and cheaper to audit. During years of budget cuts, the IRS leaned on algorithms that prioritized efficiency over fairness. The result was a classist and racialized audit and enforcement system built for speed and to protect the wealthy.&nbsp;</p><p>The Biden administration hoped to reverse course by restoring the IRS’s capacity to serve the public. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 <a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/irs-thinks-big-about-how-spend-80-billion?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>secured nearly $80 billion</u></a> in new funding aimed at modernizing technology, rebuilding the workforce, and ensuring that tax enforcement was applied to the wealthy as well as the poor. The New York Times recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/upshot/tax-audits-wealthy-biden-trump.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>reported</u></a> that the IRS upheld Biden’s pledge to increase audits but only on the wealthy. Those efforts have now largely been halted.</p><p>These decades of targeting the IRS weren’t just an attack on one agency. They were an attack on the state’s ability to govern fairly. A well-resourced IRS is more than a bureaucratic necessity; it is democratic infrastructure. It enables the equal enforcement of the law, the redistribution of wealth, and the delivery of public goods. Fiscal fairness becomes impossible when that capacity is gutted, and democracy becomes performative. The IRS wasn’t <strong>neglected </strong>by conservatives: it has been meticulously <strong>redesigned </strong>to concentrate power and wealth along lines of class and race. Its mission was <strong>retooled </strong>to be less a guardian of the public interest and more a <strong>servant of market discipline.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>And today, that project is entering a new and far more dangerous phase.</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-grey kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Buy a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<h3 id=\"trump-doge-and-the-new-model-of-fiscal-control\"><strong>Trump, DOGE,&nbsp; and the New Model of Fiscal Control</strong></h3><p>Under the Trump administration, DOGE has aggressively intervened in the IRS by seeking access to sensitive taxpayer data, orchestrating mass layoffs, and eliminating public-friendly programs like <a href=\"https://fas.org/publication/end-of-irs-direct-file/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Direct File</u></a>. They don’t want to just dismantle the IRS. They want to further rewire it, transforming a civic institution into a political instrument. In this vision, taxation is no longer a shared obligation but a mechanism of ideological enforcement. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/opinion/musk-doge-data-ai.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Surveillance becomes the method</u></a>, and loyalty to the president the metric. This transformation is rooted in the logic of <em>new public management</em>—a technocratic framework that reshapes public institutions to resemble private firms: lean, automated, data-driven, and detached from democratic accountability.&nbsp;</p><p>This shift doesn’t just weaken the IRS. It bypasses the democratic infrastructure that’s supposed to govern it. What was once a chain of accountability—from lawmaking to enforcement to public benefit—is now being rerouted through executive command and algorithmic control. Under this model, the IRS ceases to be a steward of fiscal democracy and instead morphs into an engine of information extraction: surveilling the public, enforcing hierarchy, and concentrating power.</p><p>The consequences are already visible: the IRS’s <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/irs-ice-agreement-weakening-privacy-protections-poses-risks-for-all-taxpayers?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>agreement</u></a> to share confidential taxpayer data with ICE has raised alarms about privacy and the agency's role in enforcement beyond taxation; and the threatened revocations of nonprofit status for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-exempt-status.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>universities,</u></a> climate organizations, and racial justice groups—justified under the guise of fiscal scrutiny—are not neutral acts of enforcement. They are <strong>party-focused interventions</strong>, using the tax code to intimidate critics and constrain dissent.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve seen this before, and it should scare us. In countries like Hungary and Rwanda, governments have turned tax authorities into instruments of repression—not by banning civil society outright, but by burying it in audits, compliance demands, and legal ambiguity. Bureaucratic coercion becomes a substitute for overt censorship. The United States is now testing the contours of that same strategy: deploying regulatory pressure to erode opposition, cloaking political retaliation in administrative form, and transforming fiscal policy into a weapon of ideological discipline.</p><p>What’s also being lost in all of this is not just IRS institutional expertise or workforce capacity. It’s the legitimacy of the social contract: the idea that taxation is a collective democratic function. DOGE’s approach echoes a system where data is extracted not to serve the public, but to entrench private and executive power. In this framework, the IRS no longer upholds civic duty, but instead enforces obedience. Public authority <strong>remains</strong>, but democratic accountability <strong>disappears</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"if-you-control-the-tax-code-and-the-irs-you-control-the-state-and-the-people\"><strong>If You Control the Tax Code and the IRS, You Control the State and The People</strong></h3><p>This isn’t just bureaucratic reshuffling. It’s a battle over the very structure of American democracy. The IRS, as the engine of fiscal governance, is being gutted, rewired, and weaponized. While Congress still (in theory) formally holds the power of the purse, control over how tax laws are enforced and against whom is increasingly shifting to the executive branch. And the tax code, once a tool for potential shared investment, is being further entrenched as a shield for elite impunity.</p><p>If a sitting president can direct the IRS to investigate political enemies, revoke nonprofit status from dissenting institutions, or selectively enforce tax law to reward loyalty, the agency no longer serves the public. It serves power. The slow hollowing of the IRS through funding cuts, staff attrition, and the erosion of norms yields the same result: a weakened institution unable to enforce the law, uphold equity, or hold the powerful to account.</p><p>And when that happens, the disparities baked into our fiscal system deepen. The rich, already shielded by armies of tax lawyers and offshore vehicles, become even more invisible to enforcement. Meanwhile, the working class, especially Black and brown taxpayers, are subject to increased scrutiny and bureaucratic punishment. When Nixon overstepped, Congress stepped in. But today, a deeply polarized legislature, decades of executive aggrandizement, and a judiciary increasingly deferential to presidential authority have eroded those checks. Now the stakes are higher, not just because of the power being wielded, but because of whom that power targets and whom it protects.</p><p>We are no longer just watching a system decay. We are watching it be consolidated to serve private power, silence dissent, and reverse the very idea of democratic taxation. It’s a constitutional breakdown. If the IRS falls, we won’t just lose an agency; we’ll lose one of the last institutional expressions of democratic obligation. Taxation is not just how we keep a number of key infrastructures running—it is how we declare what we value, who we protect, and who must answer to the public. The IRS reflects that social contract, however imperfectly, and not without deep bias. But unlike some other federal institutions, its mandate remains tenuously anchored in public law and congressional oversight. It is one of the few places where the struggle over fiscal accountability is still active and, for now, structurally possible.</p><p>We don’t need to defend what the IRS has been. We need to fight for what it could be: a mechanism of equity, not control by the elite. And accountability, not surveillance. But if we allow it to collapse—or worse, to be captured for authoritarianism—we may wake up in a country where taxation still exists, <strong>but democracy does not.</strong></p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-fiscal-state-under-siege-why-people-hate-the-irs-and-why-you-should-care/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"0ee75e51-9339-4b4f-b76d-c03f4b94c0d7","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"684a7989b3542f0001f70a51","reading_time":14}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"June 10","id":"Ghost__Post__6848547bdcf72200012b9711","title":"NOTICE: I’m available for talks and other kinds of paid speaking engagements","slug":"notice-im-available-for-talks-and-other-kinds-of-paid-speaking-engagements","featured":false,"feature_image":null,"featuredImg":null,"excerpt":"email me to inquire\n\nI- Nathan Tankus- have never mentioned it to my email list, but in the fine print of my website I’ve always listed that I’m available for paid speaking engagements.
