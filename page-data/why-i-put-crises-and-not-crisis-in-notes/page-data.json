I caught Covid in\nthe early part of the Omicron wave, throwing my work schedule off balance. I am\nback to normal scheduled writing as of this piece. Thank you as always to my\nsubscribers.\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]Since we are now in the\nthird year of the Coronavirus Pandemic (yes, that is still happening!), I wanted\nto begin the year by assessing where we are, and how our current moment fits\ninto the broader social problems we are facing.\n\nOne way of doing that is simply interrogating the name of this newsletter — \nNotes on the Crises. As you may have seen in other venues, from social media to\nreporting, this title frequently trips people up. Almost invariably people say\n“crisis” instead of “crises”. In fact, when I created this newsletter I knew\nthis title would be misread. Yet, I decided to stick with “crises” anyway. I did\nthat for the simple reason that this is not the only crisis we will encounter\nover the next several decades. \n\n\nIn fact, leading into the pandemic I had spent most of the past year working on\na report on alternative credit policy tools to interest rate policy. I’d\nespecially focused on the Green New Deal as a major example of a policy\nframework that should incorporate contractionary credit policy tools, over\ninterest rate increases. That report, after significant pandemic disruptions,\nwill be out early next month (launched in this very newsletter!) With Climate\nChange occupying my mind, it was clear to me at the time that Notes on the\nCrises needed a name that could accommodate an eventual transition to writing\nabout environmental turmoil and its surrounding policy challenges. \n\n\nThe pandemic also serves as a microcosm for what Climate Change policy will look\nlike. (See Adam Tooze’s reflection on the broken metaphor of ‘China’s Chernobyl’ \nin our last podcast.\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/notes-on-the-crises-podcast-2-adam-tooze-talks-shutdown/]\n) Our failures to respond to problems preemptively will soon mean greater\ndamage, death and destruction. In fact, they already do. Meanwhile, our belated\nresponse in order to try to gain control of large scale complex phenomena will\ninvolve controversial emergency shutdowns, to quickly shutdown spread  — in one\ncase viral transmission, and the other carbon emissions. The climate example is\neven bleaker because shutdowns will not have a direct —or even significant\n —relationship to contemporary overwhelmed emergency responses in the same way\nthat shutdowns relieve pressure on healthcare systems.\n\n\nBut we can’t give the coming crisis of climate change our full attention just\nyet: the Coronavius is (sadly) not over yet. Today the pandemic remains the\ndriving force of what is going on nationally and globally. This simple truth may\nbe difficult to accept, because the contrary\n[https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2022/01/27/the-nyts-polarizing-pandemic-pundit-00003059] \nis so often stated. At multiple times last year the Biden administration\nattempted to declare the pandemic over. When they declared that Coronavirus is\nbecoming a “pandemic of the unvaccinated”, that was another iteration of trying\nto put the pandemic “behind us”.  Many mainstream news outlets have implied that\nCovid is either under control, or soon will be. Stubbornly, the pandemic has not\nlistened. \n\n\nThis campaign of denialism has now reached the point that we have pushed the\nhealthcare system far over capacity, and the Biden administration has still\nshown no interest in any mitigation efforts that are not simply vaccination.\nEven vaccination itself has not involved the outreach work that, say, the census\ninvolves i.e. door knocking and opening physical offices across the country\nwhere you can talk to an informed representative about your questions and\nconcerns. In fairness to the Biden administration, the mere suggestion of door\nknocking by president Biden was met with outrage by the governor of Missouri\n[https://fox4kc.com/news/missouri-news/gov-parson-pushes-back-on-federal-door-to-door-vaccination-campaign-in-missouri/]\n. However, trying nothing because trying things will encounter strong political\nresistance when this many lives are on the line is not leadership and there is\nno reason those of us on the sidelines should accept that kind of reasoning.\n\n\n\nAnd make no mistake, many lives are on the line. Far from coming to a close in\nthe short term, Covid is an on-going and worsening crisis too many are hoping to\nwish away. According to the New York Times\n[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html], the 7 day death\naverage in the United States is about 2500 deaths a day. That is a truly\nstaggering amount. That is not far off from the peak of deaths in the winter of\n2020-2021. The number of people hospitalized with Covid has started to trend\ndown but is still a staggering 146,000 people. The peak in winter 2020-2021 was\n136,000 people. Partial vaccination and a complete lack of mitigation measures\ndo not end pandemics even though vaccination provides strong protection to\nindividuals. Denying this doesn’t make Covid disappear, nor does it make the\nsocial ramifications of Coronavirus disappear.\n\n\n\nIn this context I have had trouble joining the month to month coverage of the\nFederal Reserve’s actions, and the discussion of where we are at relative to\n“full employment”. In my view a great many commentators are mistaking\ncircumstances where service workers are responding to workplaces which have\nbecome dramatically more unsafe and unpleasant, for a “strong” labor market\nwhere workers have true bargaining power. It is true that employers have had to\nraise wage rates to have even a minimal chance to attract workers — but they\nhave budged on working conditions far less. This is in part because working\nconditions are more of a matter of collective standards and it is very hard to\nget agreement on protections which are not widely accepted across workplaces.\nThe controversy over “school closings” reflects this. Pundits rhetorically\ninveigh against closing schools when community (and school) transmission spikes\nby pointing to the lack of protections (or closures) at bars and restaurants. \n\n\nA highly unionized profession with higher standards for workplace safety has\nextreme difficulty defending itself when there exists a low wage workforce where\nworking conditions can collapse without social response. As a result, teacher\nunions have largely made concessions on worker conditions and earlier agreements\nto tie whether school would be “remote” or not to community transmission rates.\nIronically, this has simply meant school closures anyway as the Omicron surge\ncaused staff shortages that made in-person school impossible.\n\n\nWhether you agree with my view of the “school closure” debate, the point is that\naggregate wage and employment rate measures about the health of “the economy”\nfor ordinary workers are much more misleading in the midst of a pandemic where\nwe lack similarly high quality working conditions measures. This is, in part,\nbecause working conditions are a qualitative factor rather than something\nmeasured in dollars or hours worked. It is also simply because we have not\ninvested sufficient  resources into producing measures of the quality of\nworkplaces. Those wage gains for lower waged workers still matter of course.\nThey also likely will not reverse when the pandemic is over. But they are a\nbarometer of how bad conditions are, not a conventionally “improving” labor\nmarket.\nZooming out even more, we can note that the pandemic is still going on globally.\nThe global vaccination effort has been minimally resourced, at best. There have\nbeen, for example, no issuance of SDRs\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/listen-fed-the-imf-needs-access-to/] by the IMF or\nlarge grants from the United States. Instead, the U.S. is planning on raising\ninterest rates which is already tightening dollar financial conditions (and thus\nexchange rates) for countries that are already overstretched in their pandemic\nresponse. This is also another sense where the term “crises” applies.\nCoronavirus is not simply one “crisis”, but many interlocking ones. It is hard\nto even keep track of all the different “Coronavirus crises”. Ending all of\nthese Coronavirus crises will take far more concerted and global effort than is\nbeing made and the desire (especially among U.S. elites)  to wish it all away\nonly extends them further. Of course, the same applies to climate change as\nwell. Hence Notes on the Crises not “Notes on the Crisis”.\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]Printer Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/18rscSge64TOrUiXBR93LOpwD8Ij89D-n/view?usp=sharing]","html":"<p><br><em>Sorry for the absence since my last piece on December 20th.
