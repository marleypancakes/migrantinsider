With the exception of the Milwaukee Area\nRenters Study\n[https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mdesmond/files/desmondshollenberger.demography.2015.pdf]\n, evictions are rarely measured in economic surveys. To fill this gap, we\nconducted a novel national survey on evictions within the Housing Module of the\nSurvey of Consumer Expectations (SCE)\n[https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce/housing#main] in 2019 and 2020\nThat 2020 survey was conducted in February 2020, so it serves as a valuable\nbaseline for what began happening afterwards. But in itself that survey doesn’t\ntell us much about the overall pandemic experience. Nonetheless, it's worth\nreading in full. Some valuable information it provides us is some sense of the\nexperience with evictions in the population as a whole and among renters:\n\n> More than 24 percent of households know someone who has been evicted and about 4\npercent of households have been evicted themselves. These rates are\nsubstantially higher for current renters, with 37 percent knowing someone\nevicted since 2006 and 9 percent having an eviction history. For homeowners,\nthese shares are 21 percent and 2 percent, respectively.\nIt had been a while since I corresponded with the researchers who included these\neviction questions in the housing module of the survey of consumer expectations.\nSince then, I hadn’t seen anything come from the “Liberty Street” blog, so this\nweek I decided to get back in contact with another email. They informed me that\nthey had not included any eviction questions in the 2021 survey. I followed up,\nsurprised, asking why and was told by one researcher that:\n\n> One reason was that given the eviction moratorium, evictions would have been\nrare.\nI find this reasoning weak, to say the least. As their own earlier blog post\nsays: “First, evictions can happen outside\n[https://evictionlab.org/methods/#all-evictions]of the court system. Some\nevidence even suggests that more than half of evictions are informal, without\nbeing ordered by a court”. Out-of-Court evictions would likely be more important \nunder an eviction moratorium which would make the inclusion of eviction\nquestions more important. Even worse, because the CDC eviction moratorium \nrequired atestation by renters\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/fiscal-cliffication-continues-as/] (and, in\naddition, their awareness of the CDC eviction protection), court evictions were\nstill very possible. It would be nice to have evidence for how many court\nevictions still happened, and for how long it took the word to get out about CDC\neviction protection. \n\n\nThe missing eviction questions are also strange because the “Federal Reserve\nBank of New York’s Community Development Unit” has been extensively covering the\n“eviction crisis”. They’ve also put out white papers\n[https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/regional_outreach/2021/20210923] on\neffective eviction protection, where they bemoan the lack of data. I expect they\nwould have ideas for producing consistent eviction-related housing data in their\nown survey. That would also serve to provide evidence for the effect of the\neviction moratorium as moratoriums expire and the pandemic does (or does not)\nrecede.

These researchers have been very forthright and helpful in\ncommunications with me. I appreciate the data that their past surveys provide,\nand think they helpfully contribute to our understanding of evictions. I also\nhave no idea whether they decided not to include these questions, or whether\nthat decision was made on a budgetary basis above them. Nonetheless, I also\nthink it is important to hold the Federal Reserve System to account for its\nresearch decisions. I think it is a grave and baffling error to not include\neviction related questions, and not make them a regular part of the Survey of\nConsumer Expectations.
