One point I have\nemphasized is that there hasn’t been a generalized shortage of goods and\nservices across the board since the Coronavirus pandemic began. Instead, there\nhave been particular important inputs and consumer goods experiencing\nbottlenecks. These bottlenecks have had spillover effects on other parts of the\neconomy. Early in 2020 I described\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/how-to-pay-for-the-pandemic-war/] the initial phase\nof the pandemic as the tricky task of “safely mobilizing people to produce more\nsafety equipment and then mobilizing non-front line workers with spare safety\nequipment to meet other needs. The production of N-95 masks by means of N-95\nmasks, as it were.”\n\n\n\nIn 2021 the bottleneck in safety equipment abated but new bottlenecks emerged\nin\nsemi-conductors, wood products, meat and oil\n[https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/the-physical-capacity-shortage-view-of-inflation/] \n(among a few other products). These particular bottlenecks had outsized impacts\non the overall economy, and consumer price indices. Energy, meat and\nsemi-conductor related car prices have been overwhelmingly the source of higher\nmeasured “inflation”. That means these particular industries have been critical\nto the call for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.\n\n\nWhile a pandemic was not at the front of my mind in 2019, a scenario much like\nthis did occupy my mind in 2019. In fact, it was almost all I could talk about. \nAt a time of persistently low interest rates and low inflation, I was concerned\nabout how proposals to transform the economy (such as the Green New Deal) would\nrun aground on localized bottlenecks, rising measured inflation and rising\ninterest rates. In a Financial Times op ed\n[https://www.ft.com/content/539618f8-b88c-3125-8031-cf46ca197c64] published\nMarch 2019 by my colleagues Rohan Grey, Scott Fullwiler and myself wrote about\nthe various institutional changes that would need to be made to proactively\nrespond to inflation while engaging in large spending projects. We emphasized,\nin particular, that elevated price indices were neither necessary nor sufficient\nevidence of bottlenecks:\n\n\n\n> Regardless of which policy tool is used in a particular context, demand\nmanagement in general needs to lean much more heavily on the appearance of\nbottlenecks in specific industries instead of simply tracking changes in a\ngeneral price index. The immediate signs of bottlenecks are large and sustained\nrises in unfilled orders for specific goods and services. Preventing shortages\nis after all what demand management is first and foremost about and price\nindices are misleading policy targets when they include factors that are\ninsensitive to demand and would be counterproductive to manage with demand.\n\n\nIn other words, we were warning in advance that higher inflation wasn’t strong\nevidence of excess aggregate demand, and that bottlenecks which require policy\nresponses could emerge without any sign in CPI. This warning, to say the least,\nhas not been heeded. But it points the way towards what a better policy suite \ncould have been.\n\n\n\nThe particular bottlenecks which emerged in 2021 have been made worse over time\nby the reluctance of businesses in these sectors to speedily increase investment\nin response. To understand why, it would be useful to go back to the most basic\n— but too often forgotten — elements of John Maynard Keynes’s General Theory of\nEmployment, Interest and Money. In particular, his idea of “effective demand”. \n\n\nI could spend a lot of time talking about this idea — there are whole books that\nin fact do this! But instead I will be emphasizing one particular element. In my\nwriting in Notes on the Crises — and in other writings about macroeconomics —\nyou will see the term “demand”, the phrases “aggregate demand” and “excess\naggregate demand”, and other variations used regularly. These terms are useful,\nif in large part just to understand what orthodox economists and policymakers\nare saying. However, they don’t tell us the whole story. In the General Theory,\nKeynes focuses on defining and refining his idea of “Effective Demand”. The key\ndifference between aggregate demand and effective demand — and the most\nimportant element for our purposes — is that effective demand refers to the\nexpectations of “entrepreneurs”. Effective demand is not simply the actual sums\nof money being spent, or preparing to be spent, “out there”. In our world, we\ncan simply think of the expectations of firms rather than “entrepreneurs”. If\nthose in charge of firms are pessimistic about future sales, effective demand \nwill be low. That’s true regardless of the factors impacting aggregate demand.\n\n\nOf course, in the immediate future, it is hard to imagine this kind of mismatch\nsustaining itself. If a firm doesn’t produce because it expects its products to\nremain unsold, the sales and market share growth of its competitors will likely\nchange its tune. It does not, after all, take all that much to restart\nproduction that has been recently mothballed (abstracting from sudden\nbottlenecks of key inputs).\n\n\nKeynes understood this point well, which is why he divided expectations into two\ntypes. “Short term” expectations referred to the expectation that a firm can\nsell what it can produce with the plant and equipment it already controls. “Long\nterm” expectations are \"concerned with what the entrepreneur [firm] can hope to\nearn in the shape of future returns if he purchases (or, perhaps, manufactures)\n'finished' output as an addition to his capital equipment\". In other words, long\nterm expectations relate to whether the sales will be there to make building \nmore capacity, or even an entire new factory, worth it. \n\n\nHere lies the issue. Keynes highlights that: \"The actually realised results of\nthe production and sale of output will only be relevant to employment in so far\nas they cause a modification of subsequent expectation\". If sales growth in 2021\nor 2022 doesn’t lead to expectations of higher sales in 2027 and 2028,\nbusinesses have no reason to invest in plant and equipment with multi-year,\nperhaps even multi-decade, lifespans. \n\n\nNow it is likely that years upon years of annual sales growth could eventually\nalign “short term” and “long term” expectations. However, that would take quite\na long time. This possibility is also being currently closed by the Federal\nReserve. Chairman Powell is doing his best to validate business expectations\nthat effective demand has not increased by lowering aggregate demand today. In a\nsense, interest rate policy is closing the gap by perversely lowering short term\nexpectations until they are in line with long term expectations. Even more\nperversely, their very unwillingness to invest in new capacity has contributed\nto the elevated CPI readings, which have led to elite pressure on the Federal\nReserve to lower inflation through choking demand.\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]Which brings me to my\ncolleagues at Employ America [https://twitter.com/employamerica]. They \nrecognized this issue\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-24/the-economy-is-booming-why-don-t-firms-believe-it] \nearly on in 2021 and have been aiming their output at making policy\nrecommendations to ameliorate them. Two weeks ago I covered their\nrecommendations\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/dont-let-dick-cheney-ruin-price-regulation-too/] \nfor bringing down price growth in sectors that are not experiencing bottlenecks.\nThe other half of their output has been devoted to particular bottlenecked\nsectors and what can be done about them. In May they called their analysis the \n“The Physical Capacity Shortage View of Inflation”\n[https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/the-physical-capacity-shortage-view-of-inflation/]\n. If we can’t quickly break through pessimistic expectations that are lowering\n“long term effective demand” by boosting “short term effective demand”, we need\nto either directly invest in additional capacity or insure firms against\nnegative surprises in the future.\n\n\nOn this general point, I agree with Employ America. And if their proposals only\napplied to relatively minor (though economically important) sectors like the\nsemi-conductor manufacturing industry, I would not voice any objection. However,\nthey are not just making proposals in these sectors. They are also proposing\ninsuring the oil and gas industry against costly surprises, in order to sustain\nand boost oil and gas investment. To summarize briefly, their proposal\n[https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/spr-esf-dpa/] is to have the\nTreasury use a facility called the “Exchange Stabilization Fund'' to sell oil\nproducers a financial contract that would protect them from declines in oil\nprices. These types of contracts- called “put options''- give their holders the\noption- but not the obligation- to sell oil at a previously agreed upon price to\nthe U.S. government. The government could then, in turn, take physical delivery\nof oil and add it to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\n\nThis is a very well thought out and creative proposal. I have no doubt that it\nis one way to stabilize oil markets. However, as someone who focuses on climate\nchange as a topic for economic policy, I must object. There are particular\nglaring factors which make these kinds of schemes inadvisable in the Oil and Gas\nindustry, even if there is a good argument for them elsewhere.\n\n\nTo state the obvious, fossil fuels are the core source of carbon emissions. They\nare, along with other greenhouse gases, preventing heat from escaping into space\nand gradually warming planet Earth. Burning as little remaining fossil fuels as\npossible while we pursue electrifying our economy and, at the same time,\ndecarbonizing electricity production is the main mission humanity has in the\n21st century. In turn, the oil and gas industry is the main political opponent\nwhich advocates of combating climate change have to defeat (though by no means\nthe only one). Making sure that the oil and gas industry doesn’t bear the\ndownside uncertainties inherent in oil and gas investment strengthens this\nindustry — and makes it more difficult to defeat. \n\n\nThis political basis alone would be enough to object to such proposals. Yet, the\nissue at hand is worse than this. The very problem these proposals aim to solve\nshows us why it's a bad idea in this case. While we can’t get rid of fossil fuel\ninfrastructure overnight (to say the least!) we have to avoid incentivizing a\nbig jump in Oil and Gas infrastructure and capacity. Recall that the argument\nfor these kinds of proposals is that the plant and equipment involved last for\nlong periods of time, and thus short term increases in sales can’t overcome long\nterm pessimistic expectations. This means any oil and gas investment these\nschemes successfully induce will be around for at least a decade. And in some\ncases, 20 years or more. The timeline under which we need to stop removing oil\nfrom the ground and burning it is far more strenuous than that for our existing \noil and gas infrastructure.\n\n\nOf course, this is an industry that is currently experiencing bottlenecks. Those\nare causing disruptions and those disruptions will likely get worse during the\nwinter. Simply not increasing oil and gas investment will not solve these\nproblems. Even worse, high gas prices are a major political stumbling block to\nclimate action. Decarbonization works best politically when it emerges before\ndisruptions to the Oil and Gas industry and envelopes the economy before drivers\nsee any pain at the pump. (Ideally, without any pain at the pump at all). A\nfossil fuel bottlenecked and dirty economy is an improbable candidate for\naggressive climate action. This is something I agree with Employ America\nresearchers about, and is thus a criticism of mainstream climate policy\nadvocates I share. Carbon pricing and institutional investor disinvestment have\ngotten far too much attention relative to the transformation the economy — and\nour energy grid- needs  and the aggressive fiscal policies needed to make that\nhappen. The action has been more on the demand side than has been commonly\nacknowledged (in fact far more so).\n\n\nHowever, none of that means we need more fossil fuel infrastructure. There are\nmany ways of tackling energy consumption today (and reducing emissions) while\ncooling the global oil and gas market. Paul Williams, Yakov Feygin, Chirag Lala\nand Mitch Green put out a report last month entitled “Cooling oil consumption\nto\nease price pressures”\n[https://www.publicenterprise.org/reports/cooling-oil-consumption-to-ease-price-pressures]\n. They get to the heart of the matter with five broad ways to get oil\nconsumption down:\n\n 1. Fare holiday to get people on buses, trains and micro-mobility as quickly as\n    possible\n 2. Compress timelines for transit infrastructure investments to grow ridership\n    base\n 3. Incentives for firms to allow and encourage employees to work from home\n 4. Encourage carpooling with incentives and a bully pulpit campaign\n 5. Consider a national speed limit reduction\n\nReaders can agree or disagree with one or more of these proposals, or declare\nthat they would not be enough. However, the point is, in the case of energy, we\nhave a lot of levers that we can move before we try to increase oil and gas\ninvestment. Get other smart people in a room, and at least a dozen more good\nideas will emerge. The International Energy Agency has produced its own ten\npoint plan [https://www.iea.org/reports/a-10-point-plan-to-cut-oil-use] to\nreduce oil use which overlaps with the Center for Public Enterprise’s proposals.\nTo be clear: I know the folks at Employ America do not oppose these measures.\nHowever, I do not think proposing subsidies — however uniquely structured or\nwell designed those subsidies are — for the oil and gas industry is appropriate.\nAt least not as long as there are so many other options to pursue. \n\n\nEmploy America are respected for doing serious analysis because they do serious\nanalysis. I suspect (though do not personally know) that there are officials in\nthe Biden administration who listen to them. I think this for the simple reason\nthat they are one of the few organizations consistently putting out realistic,\nsectorally informed and detailed proposals responding to current economic\nproblems. When important organizations like Employ America put these kinds of\nproposals on the table, they legitimate them. An administration looking for easy\nand quick fixes will gravitate to the easiest and quickest fix offered by people\nwho know what they are talking about. That is dangerous when it comes to oil and\ngas. As a result, I strenuously disagree with this proposal being accepted, and\ncall for others to reject it as designed. Economic policy advocates, officials\nand staffers should start from the position that fossil fuel infrastructure\nshould not be supported or subsidized without countervailing regulation, public\nownership or stipulations . I hope my friends at Employ America junk it as well.\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]Printer Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IKW3OFcZmrrAzEK32A1GyURlWgFL5c-b/view?usp=sharing]","html":"<p><em>This is a free piece of Notes on the Crises.

Carbon pricing and <strong>institutional investor disinvestment have gotten far too much attention </strong>relative to the transformation the economy — and our energy grid- needs  and the aggressive fiscal policies needed to make that happen. The action has been more on the demand side than has been commonly acknowledged (in fact far more so).<br></p><p>However, none of that means we need more fossil fuel infrastructure. There are many ways of tackling energy consumption today (and reducing emissions) while cooling the global oil and gas market. Paul Williams, Yakov Feygin, Chirag Lala and Mitch Green put out a report last month entitled <a href=\"https://www.publicenterprise.org/reports/cooling-oil-consumption-to-ease-price-pressures?ref=crisesnotes.com\">“Cooling oil consumption to ease price pressures”</a>. They get to the heart of the matter with five broad ways to get oil consumption down:</p><ol><li>Fare holiday to get people on buses, trains and micro-mobility as quickly as possible</li><li>Compress timelines for transit infrastructure investments to grow ridership base</li><li>Incentives for firms to allow and encourage employees to work from home</li><li>Encourage carpooling with incentives and a bully pulpit campaign</li><li>Consider a national speed limit reduction</li></ol><p>Readers can agree or disagree with one or more of these proposals, or declare that they would not be enough. However, the point is, in the case of energy, <strong>we have a lot of levers that we can move before we try to increase oil and gas investment. </strong>Get other smart people in a room, and at least a dozen more good ideas will emerge. The International Energy Agency has produced <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/a-10-point-plan-to-cut-oil-use?ref=crisesnotes.com\">its own ten point plan</a> to reduce oil use which overlaps with the Center for Public Enterprise’s proposals. To be clear: I know the folks at Employ America do not oppose these measures. However, I do not think proposing subsidies — however uniquely structured or well designed those subsidies are — for the oil and gas industry is appropriate. At least not as long as there are so many other options to pursue. <br></p><p>Employ America are respected for doing serious analysis because <strong>they do</strong> serious analysis. I suspect (though do not personally know) that there are officials in the Biden administration who listen to them. I think this for the simple reason that they are one of the few organizations consistently putting out realistic, sectorally informed and detailed proposals responding to current economic problems. When important organizations like Employ America put these kinds of proposals on the table, they legitimate them. An administration looking for easy and quick fixes will gravitate to the easiest and quickest fix offered by people who know what they are talking about. <strong>That is dangerous when it comes to oil and gas. </strong>As a result, I strenuously disagree with this proposal being accepted, and call for others to reject it as designed. Economic policy advocates, officials and staffers should start from the position that fossil fuel infrastructure should not be supported or subsidized without countervailing regulation, public ownership or stipulations . I hope my friends at Employ America junk it as well.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IKW3OFcZmrrAzEK32A1GyURlWgFL5c-b/view?usp=sharing&ref=crisesnotes.com\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Printer Friendly Version</a></div>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-insuring-the-oil-and-gas-industry-the-right-response-to-the-fallout-from-ukraine/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"419a3196-387c-4e28-ac00-1cfb1ddf97f7","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"62dfc34d693255003d2bd838","reading_time":9}},"pageContext":{"slug":"is-insuring-the-oil-and-gas-industry-the-right-response-to-the-fallout-from-ukraine","limit":10,"skip":0}},"staticQueryHashes":["1022999749","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
