There I briefly touched on some\nreceived narratives about “price gouging” that have circulated among the center\nleft. While I am skeptical that much of the elevated growth in the Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI) or the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index (PCE) so\nfar can be explained by discrete corporate pricing decisions, orthodox economist\nresponses to these discussions have been far worse. They have tried to rule out\nthe possibility that corporations can ever raise prices to elevate target profit\nmargins (merely by assumption). They have also taken aim at any form of direct\nprice regulation, by shaking around textbook mythologies about past experiences\nwith “price controls” (claims made without much historical context.)\n\n\nThere have been too many commentaries, and too much nonsense, to deal with every\nargument here. However, I will take aim at a few primary issues that I think\nhave been the core of these silly exchanges. \n\n\nAt the most fundamental level, this conversation starts from assuming its own\nconclusion. As discussed last week: mainstream economists believe that elevated\ninflation is a result of “excess” aggregate demand. If you believe this, direct\nprice regulation cannot “stop” (or permanently reduce) inflation by assumption.\nAll it can do is “repress” inflation: make shortages worse, and lead to higher\ninflation when price regulations are lifted. The money that people would have\nspent on higher prices for those goods will simply be directed to other, less\nprice regulated goods.\n\n\nThe obvious issue is that we don’t all agree with orthodox economists about what\nis leading to higher headline inflation today. If the price increases are\nconcentrated in certain sectors—which they are—and the bottlenecks are\nconcentrated on specific goods—which they are—then price regulation in sectors\nthat aren’t experiencing bottlenecks can lower headline inflation, without\nattendant problems. Price regulation can even be effective where the bottlenecks\nare heavily concentrated in very specific areas.\n[https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2021/dec/29/inflation-price-controls-time-we-use-it]\n\n\nEven more fundamentally, if we believe that firm pricing power is a sustained\nissue of public concern (and not simply something that only matters in\nextraordinary situations) then we don’t have to believe that price regulation is\nof limited, time specific, interest. This is a very controversial point in some\ncircles—but I think returning to a concrete assessment of price indices can make\nit more palatable for even the most hard charging critics of price regulation.\nTelecoms, utilities, medical prices, education, insurance and rental housing are\nall “unique” areas of the economy, where even many centrists agree that very\nsignificant pricing power exists, and should be constrained in some way. For\nsome of these sectors, even direct price regulation is much less controversial\nthan it is elsewhere. Rent regulation is of course very controversial outside\nthe left—but at this point, even right wingers argue that legal changes need to\nbe made to constrain rent increases. They just believe those legal changes\nshould only be zoning changes.\n\n\nWhen you add up these categories, they make up between 40% and 47% of price\nindices, depending on the weighting used or whether you use the Consumer Price\nIndex or the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index. Granted the majority\nof that number is made of housing in CPI (but not PCE). Yet, as I will argue,\nthe case that direct price regulation wouldn’t lower rental inflation (even if\nyou think it is a bad policy) is not very compelling. The central argument\nagainst direct rent regulation at the local level is based on the idea that it\nwould eliminate the private incentive to build more housing. This argument is \nbased on “first generation” rent regulations. These set absolute caps and,\nespecially under wartime conditions, made it notionally possible that landlords\ncould have costs outrun rents. But how relevant is this approach to today’s\npolicy discussions? No area of the United States has had this kind of rent \nregulation in decades\n[https://jwmason.org/slackwire/considerations-on-rent-control/] (with the\nexception of some apartments, which are grandfathered in literally from the\nworld war two era, in a few jurisdictions).\n\n\n\n\nThis post isn’t going to discuss the topic of rent regulation in full detail.\nHowever, regardless of what you think about the rent regulation debate at the\nlocal level, it is extremely unlikely that whatever rent regulation could be\napplied to rent renewals at the federal level would make it unprofitable to\nconstruct more housing, to serve areas which have seen significant population\nnet inflows (such as the south). Further, in the extreme case that this was a\nserious concern, the federal government could devote far more funding to simply\nconstructing new housing directly. Even if you think both rent regulations and\npublic housing construction (or even just public financing of housing\nconstruction) are bad ideas, I think it would be very difficult to make the case\nthat rental inflation would be just as high, if that program was implemented.\n\n\nNow if you accept the orthodox story, all of this is basically irrelevant. Sure,\ndirect price regulation may reduce the upward contribution of these categories\nto price indices, but all of that will be redirected elsewhere. However, if you\ndon’t accept this story, then strengthening price regulation over simply these\ncategories—where even conservatives argue there are market structure issues\nenabling market power driven price increases—can reduce headline inflation. My\ncolleagues at Employ America implicitly made this case in their\nstraightforwardly titled late 2021 article: “Offsetting Persistent Inflationary\nPressures With Disinflationary Healthcare Policy”\n[https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/inflation-and-healthcare/].\n\n\nIn the piece, they argued: \n\n\n> Unlike other major components of core PCE, federal policy and rule-making can\nhave substantial and direct effects for healthcare. Keeping inflation readings\nin check over the coming years would represent a major opportunity to\ndemonstrate that the ambitious fiscal response to the pandemic need not lead to\nhigh inflation. Targeted disinflationary healthcare policy at this juncture\ncould dramatically shift the policymaking and macroeconomic paradigms for a\ngeneration.\n\nIf Employ America bought the orthodox story, they would have to say that their\npolicy suggestions to reduce medical price inflation would simply cause\ninflation in other components of PCE. However they, like me, think the case for\naggregate demand led price increases are very weak and, like me, think it makes\nfor great politics and good economics to use targeted price regulation to lower\nheadline inflation. The presidential tools are the most straightforward in\nhealthcare but, as the most recent CPI print shows, rent is an area where they\ncould have the greatest impact—if they found the tools. Food and energy are the\nbiggest contributors to headline inflation by far, but they are most difficult\nto tackle with federal policy, let alone executive authority.\n\n\nWhich brings us back to “price controls”. The problem with price controls is not\nthat direct price regulation is a bad idea—it's that they have historically been\ndesigned with the idea in mind that “the” problem is excess demand. As should be\nclear from above, the “excess demand” argument implies that every single price\nin the economy needs to be “controlled”. Otherwise, “uncontrolled” prices will\nsimply experience larger price jumps. Even worse, price regulations needed to be\ntemporary in this framing. For one thing, you “have to” eventually return to\n“market organization”. For another, the point of the controls was to “slow the\nmomentum” of prices. Once “momentum” successfully slows, price stability should\ncontinue on its own. \n\nTo summarize, the relentless logic of the orthodox position leads to the idea\nthat if price controls are to work, they must be sophisticated enough to\nregulate every price in the economy. They also need to be a surprise—so markets\ndon’t “get ahead of them” with big price jumps. Finally, they must be temporary.\nLooked at this way, it's a miracle there are any successful experiences with\nprice controls. I also can’t emphasize enough that all of this sidesteps the\nissue of market power. If you think at least a part of headline inflation comes\nfrom businesses using pricing power to raise profit margins, then the frustrated\nprice increases in those sectors during the “control” period will simply appear\nall at once when prices are decontrolled. This is true even if you happen to be\nsomeone who thinks only peculiar businesses such as telecoms, utilities,\nhospitals and universities have that kind of market power. This “jump” of prices\nafter decontrol is precisely what was observed in the Nixon experience.\n\n\nThis is also not a retrospective criticism. Gardiner Means, the New Deal\neconomist who coined the term “administered prices” made this point in real\ntime, in both newspapers and articles. His criticisms are especially\nnotable—because he was no enemy of price regulation. In 1975 he referred to this\nprice control experience as “Nixon’s bumbling policies”\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sKkrAzbHi9r7KtB6FjHiK9OzDuBOjIwT/view?usp=sharing]\n. Having read what Dick Cheney (yes that Dick Cheney!) had to say about his\nexperience running Nixon’s price controls it's very difficult not to agree.\nCheney’s boss was none other than Donald Rumsfeld. I can’t resist quoting Dick\nCheney at length:\n\n> \nThe Democratic majority in Congress was urging the president to use powers they\nhad given him when they passed the Economic Stabilization Act, legislation that\neffectively authorized him to commandeer the economy by imposing controls on\nwages, prices, salaries, and rents. The Democrats voted these extraordinary\npowers confident that no Republican president, much less a solid free market one\nnamed Richard Nixon, would ever use them, and in the meantime, they could\ncriticize him for not taking action. But Nixon took them up on their offer, and\non Sunday night, August 15, 1971, he announced a freeze for ninety days on all\nwages and prices. The Cost of Living Council was created to monitor the freeze\nand to achieve an orderly return to the free market when the ninety-day period\nwas over\n\n> The freeze was simple enough. Nobody was to raise wages or prices. But the\nfollow-on, which became known as Phase Two, would have to have rules covering\nall sorts of things, from permitted increases in union contracts to the price of\ndill pickles, for the period until market forces ruled again. The deadline for\nmoving from the freeze to Phase Two came fast, and the two entities that were\nsupposed to write the regulations, the Pay Board and the Price Commission,\nwrangled and dithered. When it looked as though they were going to miss a\ncrucial deadline for getting regulations published in the Federal Register,\nRumsfeld decided to take things in hand. He assembled Jack Grayson, the chairman\nof the Price Commission, and about a dozen of our CLC staff and said that we\nwouldn't be leaving until we had the regulations ready for the printer. We set\nup in Rumsfeld's outer office, and as others paced and dictated, I sat at one of\nthe secretary's desks and typed everything on an IBM Selectric typewriter. By\nnine the next morning, when the secretaries arrived and emptied the ashtrays and\nreplenished the coffee, we had written the regulations that would now be\ngoverning a major share of the U.S. economy. The degree of detail we achieved\nduring our overnighter was truly impressive. We drew distinctions between apples\nand applesauce; popped and unpopped corn; raw cabbage and packaged slaw; fresh\noranges and glazed citrus peel; garden plants, cut flowers, and floral wreaths.\nWe regulated seafood products \"including those which have been shelled, shucked,\niced, skinned, scaled, eviscerated, or decapitated.\" We covered products\ncustom-made to individual order, including leather goods, fur apparel, jewelry,\nand wigs and toupees.\n\n> Regulating energy prices was one of the most complex and complicated tasks the\nCLC had to address. At one point, when we were up against a deadline to set\nprices for the coming week on oil, we discovered that there was no one available\nwith expertise in that area. Then someone mentioned that Chachi Owens was from\nTexas and that Texas had a lot of oil, so we called Chachi and asked him to stop\nby. At that time he was working for the public affairs office. If the CLC was\ngoing to permit the price of bread to rise by two cents the following week, it\nwas Chachi Owens who would bring you that news. \n\n> Aside from his resonant voice, his claim to fame was that he had played fullback\nfor Darrell Royal at the University of Texas. He turned out to be a very bright\nyoung man. Perhaps it was his Texas confidence, or perhaps it was the result of\nthe coaching he'd received, but he had no hesitation about sitting down and\nwriting the oil regs we needed. [In My Time, pages 59-61]\n\n\nTo me, the lesson of the Nixon “price control” experience is that you don’t put\nRichard Nixon, Donald Rumsefeld and Dick Cheney in charge of the economy. Nixon,\na man who actually worked during World War Two in the Office of Price\nAdministration, did not like his experience, and hated his coworkers. Nixon\neven\nlater claimed later [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2953088] that it was this\nexperience which led to his “lifelong” hatred of Bureaucrats, and “big\ngovernment”. Like most of Nixon’s political moves, his dalliance with price\ncontrols was purely cynical, and carefully calculated. Very few policies can\nsurvive the lack of belief and lack of expertise of both the highest political\nofficial involved, and the government employees ordered to organize them. Add in\nthe surprise, temporary nature and complexity of the task of comprehensive price\ncontrols demanded by the orthodox framework, and you have a recipe for disaster.\n\n\n\nHowever, direct price regulation of selected sectors that are important in price\nindices are far easier to accomplish with the mechanisms that already exist.\nThey do not require price fixing for every single item, or attempts to use the\ntools best applied to administered price setters on markets(such as meat or oil)\nwhich are not organized by administered prices. Nor do they have to be temporary\nsince they are aimed at managing permanent issues of market structure and market\npower — rather than temporary issues of excess demand. Even extremely limited\nprice regulation can lower headline inflation, and relieve some pressure on the\nFederal Reserve to raise interest rates.\n\n\nCareful readers may have noticed that I focused on the sectors where the case\nfor market power-driven price increases are the most obvious, and least\ncontroversial. I happen to think that there is a case for direct price\nregulation in other sectors where administered prices predominate. I will write\nabout that more in the future—but for now interested readers can check out my\nchapter in the Cambridge Handbook of Labor in Competition Law, with Luke Herrine\n[https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-labor-in-competition-law/DA27B8F42F54C30605087123FD6F6E72]\n. I think price regulation can work in these other sectors, too. But how these\nmarkets are organized will likely need to be fundamentally changed for\nregulation to be most effective. For our purposes today, what matters is\nthat—despite what you have heard—price regulation has a role to play in saving\nthe Federal Reserve from its own policy mistakes.\n\nPrinter Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/14_5-tdqVNcr8EZczI09WQnXB7lyM_lxl/view?usp=sharing]","html":"<p><em>This is a Premium Pieces of Notes on the Crises</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/prices-prices-prices-almost-everything-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-too-annoyed-to-ask/\">In my last piece</a> I focused on laying out how I view the “inflation” conversation that has been going on in 2022 (on the abstract level).

By nine the next morning, when the secretaries arrived and emptied the ashtrays and replenished the coffee, we had written the regulations that would now be governing a major share of the U.S. economy. The degree of detail we achieved during our overnighter was truly impressive. We drew distinctions between apples and applesauce; popped and unpopped corn; raw cabbage and packaged slaw; fresh oranges and glazed citrus peel; garden plants, cut flowers, and floral wreaths. We regulated seafood products \"including those which have been shelled, shucked, iced, skinned, scaled, eviscerated, or decapitated.\" We covered products custom-made to individual order, including leather goods, fur apparel, jewelry, and wigs and toupees.<br></blockquote><blockquote>Regulating energy prices was one of the most complex and complicated tasks the CLC had to address. At one point, when we were up against a deadline to set prices for the coming week on oil, we discovered that there was no one available with expertise in that area. Then someone mentioned that Chachi Owens was from Texas and that Texas had a lot of oil, so we called Chachi and asked him to stop by. At that time he was working for the public affairs office. If the CLC was going to permit the price of bread to rise by two cents the following week, it was Chachi Owens who would bring you that news. <br></blockquote><blockquote>Aside from his resonant voice, his claim to fame was that he had played fullback for Darrell Royal at the University of Texas. He turned out to be a very bright young man. Perhaps it was his Texas confidence, or perhaps it was the result of the coaching he'd received, but he had no hesitation about sitting down and writing the oil regs we needed. [In My Time, pages 59-61]<br><br></blockquote><p>To me, the lesson of the Nixon “price control” experience is that <strong>you don’t put Richard Nixon, Donald Rumsefeld and Dick Cheney in charge of the economy.</strong> Nixon, a man who actually worked during World War Two in the Office of Price Administration, did not like his experience, and hated his coworkers. <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2953088?ref=crisesnotes.com\">Nixon even later claimed later</a> that it was this experience which led to his “lifelong” hatred of Bureaucrats, and “big government”. Like most of Nixon’s political moves, his dalliance with price controls was purely cynical, and carefully calculated. Very few policies can survive the lack of belief and lack of expertise of both the highest political official involved, and the government employees ordered to organize them. Add in the surprise, temporary nature and complexity of the task of comprehensive price controls demanded by the orthodox framework, and <strong>you have a recipe for disaster.</strong><br><br></p><p>However, direct price regulation of selected sectors that are important in price indices are far easier to accomplish with the mechanisms that already exist. They do not require price fixing for every single item, or attempts to use the tools best applied to administered price setters on markets(such as meat or oil) which are not organized by administered prices. Nor do they have to be temporary since <strong>they are aimed at managing permanent issues of market structure and market power —</strong> rather than temporary issues of excess demand. Even extremely limited price regulation can lower headline inflation, and relieve some pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.<br></p><p>Careful readers may have noticed that I focused on the sectors where the case for market power-driven price increases are the most obvious, and least controversial. I happen to think that there is a case for direct price regulation in other sectors where administered prices predominate. I will write about that more in the future—but for now interested readers can check out my chapter<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-labor-in-competition-law/DA27B8F42F54C30605087123FD6F6E72?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> in the Cambridge Handbook of Labor in Competition Law, with Luke Herrine</a>. I think <strong>price regulation can work in these other sectors, too.</strong> But how these markets are organized will likely need to be fundamentally changed for regulation to be most effective. For our purposes today, what matters is that—despite what you have heard—<strong>price regulation has a role to play in saving the Federal Reserve from its own policy mistakes.</strong></p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/14_5-tdqVNcr8EZczI09WQnXB7lyM_lxl/view?usp=sharing&ref=crisesnotes.com\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Printer Friendly Version</a></div>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/dont-let-dick-cheney-ruin-price-regulation-too/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"42c65560-109b-45b7-a53b-d8f5be9e303b","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"62d0214b693255003d2a2c99","reading_time":10}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dont-let-dick-cheney-ruin-price-regulation-too","limit":10,"skip":0}},"staticQueryHashes":["1022999749","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
