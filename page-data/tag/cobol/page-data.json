We are also looking for more information on access to and use of IDRS. \n\nAs we shared in the first installment in the series, in early February, DOGE officials entered the Treasury and the IRS and acquired access to some degree of sensitive information. Since then, many DOGE personnel have transitioned into formal roles within these agencies, embedded as federal employees –  some through political appointments, others via opaque hiring mechanisms. The current situation involves two prongs. First, concerns exist that DOGE is seeking access across a range of federal government data systems, including those of the Social Security Administration and the IRS, potentially using the latter not for legitimate tax enforcement, but for political purposes  Second, while IRS system modernization is promoted as a positive technical advancement, this may serve as a means to expand surveillance and violate data privacy laws and protections. While integrating federal data systems may seem efficient, those barriers exist because they prevent the weaponization of data against the public.\n\nThis investigation peels back the layers of the power of the technological infrastructure at the IRS.  In the first piece, we demonstrated the importance of the IRS within the US government system and the potential for surveillance and control. In this piece, we reveal what we know about new tech activities under the guise of modernization and how these differ from the IRS's decades-long operational history. To better appreciate the gravity of these actions, we also examine the IRS’s institutional knowledge embedded in its extremely experienced civil service employees and the agency’s historical context that DOGE has been determined to steamroll and ignore.\n\nDespite our in-depth reporting efforts, the deliberate opacity surrounding DOGE’s actions and plans may be the most disturbing aspect. To truly grasp the scope of their intervention, we need more information - most crucially, their data access and usage (if that’s you, send us a signal DM!). Yet even in this information vacuum, we already know quite a lot about these systems and the tremendous power that comes with controlling the IRS's vast infrastructure.\n\nLet's first examine what we know about DOGE's actions and motivations before exploring how they diverge from the institution's history and their potential implications.\n\nDOGE’s initial rhetoric was full of grand promises about modernization, but their immediate priority quickly revealed itself: securing unprecedented access to sensitive taxpayer data. The reality is DOGE now wields access to the Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS) - a system which enables IRS employees to have instantaneous visual access to centralized digital records that contain all tax-related information for individuals or business entities managed through the IRS's legacy systems, many of which still rely on COBOL programming (more on this later). Who is associated with DOGE and has access to this system, and whether they are political appointees or hired in the civil service, is shrouded in secrecy. There is the potential that, regardless of their employment status, DOGE staff may now have access that exceeds what most IRS career civil servants—whose roles actually require access to taxpayer information—are allowed, let alone political appointees.\n\nTreasury officials have claimed that DOGE wasn’t given “broad access” to the IDRS or that the access is \"anonymized\" or, in some cases, \"read-only.\" These claims ring hollow given the absence of verifiable security protocols or independent oversight. Besides, even if the DOGE’s access was technically limited, there are serious risks associated with this level of access. The lack of transparency regarding data handling is particularly concerning, as staff have reported to Nathan Tankus from early on in the payments crisis that they have no designated authority left within the Treasury to whom they can safely report security protocol breaches.\n\nWhile the Internal Revenue Code provides robust protections for taxpayer data through Section 6103, which establishes confidentiality with strict penalties for violations and permits access and sharing only under specific, explicit circumstances, we cannot verify that DOGE officials comply with these rules. This oversight gap is especially troubling as they prepare to undertake their next ambitious project: a complete rewrite of legacy systems written in Assembly Code and COBOL - programming languages that form the foundation of many critical government functions.\n\n\nThe COBOL Gambit\n\nIt’s important to note that IRS modernization was underway long before DOGE arrived. The agency has spent years attempting to upgrade legacy systems and gradually phase out older programming languages like COBOL. What DOGE is attempting is not modernization in principle, but modernization at reckless speed, divorced from institutional knowledge and technical prudence.\n\nWired Reporting indicates an alarmingly naive plan to convert decades of critical COBOL code to Java through a 30-day “hackathon”, yet the true scope and timeline of this risky undertaking remain opaque. While the project's exact details are murky, their messaging suggests an unprecedented urgency in modernization efforts. In a March FOX News appearance, Sam Corcos (representing DOGE), alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant, launched targeted criticisms of the IRS's legacy systems. Bessent amplified these claims, declaring on social media that the IRS modernization program lags 35 years behind schedule. Corcos is now a Treasury political appointee who serves as the agency’s Chief Information Officer. A career civil servant previously held that role. \n\nThis rushed rhetoric perfectly exemplifies DOGE's toxic combination of technical hubris and institutional recklessness. Despite repeated inquiries from oversight bodies and the press and urgent warnings from veteran civil servants, Treasury and the IRS maintain radio silence on the details of this unprecedented system overhaul, keeping taxpayers and Congress blind to changes that could potentially devastate America's tax infrastructure.\n\n\nA History of “Modernization” and What We’ve Already Tried\n\nModernizing the IRS or any current government system is not a one-time software upgrade; it’s a multiyear institutional overhaul requiring stable funding, cross-agency coordination, and continuous technical labor. It also means maintaining dual systems for extended periods to ensure continuity for internal operations and taxpayer use, which is an expensive but necessary measure. What failed in the past wasn’t the vision of modernization but the refusal to consistently fund and maintain it. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), and the National Taxpayer Advocate have all stated the same thing for years: the IRS cannot modernize without multi-year, predictable investments.\n\nGAO reports dating back to the early 2000s have flagged the absence of long-term funding as an impediment to the agency’s modernization goals. The National Taxpayer Advocate has echoed this repeatedly, noting in a 2019 report that the IRS’s Business Systems Modernization program was delayed not by poor planning, but by the piecemeal and inconsistent nature of congressional appropriations. This is not a controversial opinion by any stretch. In fact, the private sector consistently emphasizes multi-year stable funding as a necessary condition for most projects, especially large-scale IT initiatives. There are many examples of multi-year stable funding being the prerequisite for success. JP Morgan invested over $12 billion every year for many years, resulting in the successful modernization of legacy systems and the development of new digital banking platforms.\n\nThe IRS's technology investment funding has seen many ups and downs since Congress's establishment of the Information Technology Investment Account in FY 1997. These funding levels fall far short of what private companies spend on system improvements, despite government agencies serving millions more people and facing higher costs and consequences of service disruptions. The spending categories vary over the years, but we can consistently identify the Business Systems Modernization category that clearly shows fluctuating modernization spending between 2006 and 2022. Before the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding in 2023, business system modernization spending peaked at $468 million (2024 $) in 2011 and reached its lowest point at $309 million (2024 $) in 2018. Following the IRA allocation, spending increased dramatically to $926 million (2024 $) in 2023 and $1.3 billion (current $) in 2024 for system modernization, not including Direct File and certain other specific expenditures.\n\nAgency staff we interviewed recognized this need for stable multi-year funding. Many expressed appreciation for the increased IRA spending and advocated for ways to maintain higher funding levels even after the IRA funds expire, noting that this influx had been instrumental in advancing several critical projects. Despite these challenges and contrary to DOGE's positioning as pioneers in recognizing the IRS's technological needs, the reality is that the agency has been actively pursuing modernization for over six decades. As we said earlier, there have been mixed results, not because of government inertia but because of political neglect and chronic underfunding.\n\nBeyond the funding and political challenges we discuss above, there is a fundamental misunderstanding about what IRS modernization entails - specifically, which aspects need modernization, the best path forward, and which elements have already been acknowledged and are being addressed versus what new components DOGE is introducing. \n\n\nWhat does modernizing the IRS entail? \n\nAt its core, IRS modernization represents an overhaul of technical infrastructure and taxpayer services. This approach addresses both internal operations and public-facing capabilities. Like many other organizations with legacy systems, the IRS faced a major IT challenge: the Y2K project - a massive undertaking to address the problem with the year 2000. This issue stemmed from the way dates were stored in computer systems, using two digits for the year instead of four, which meant that when the calendar turned to 2000, systems might interpret \"00\" as 1900 rather than 2000. A more recent example of modernization effort on the public-facing side is the introduction of Direct File, which was launched as a pilot program in 2024 to offer eligible taxpayers a free, government-provided tax filing option that simplifies the process and eliminates the need for third-party software.\n\nBut for the most part, the IRS has focused on modernizing its core infrastructure by gradually replacing COBOL and Assembly Language Code systems, especially within the Individual Master File (IMF). The IMF is the oldest operating database in the federal government, conceptualized in 1959 and developed in 1962 using Assembly Language Code and COBOL. IMF remains the authoritative system for tracking every individual taxpayer’s account activity: income, credits, payments, and refunds. Legacy systems written in COBOL and Assembly Language—many still operational—form the backbone of tax processing infrastructure. While DOGE officials claim to be replacing Assembly code with Java, COBOL-based systems were reportedly being migrated to new compilers or systems known as RM/COBOL which was also being implemented at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. A major advantage of RM/COBOLis that it makes the code platform agnostic, allowing it to run on platforms other than large powerful computing systems such as mainframes. To be clear, the details that have come out about DOGE’s efforts are murky and contradictory while it is difficult to get clarity on what exactly they are either doing, or even claiming to do.\n\nThe IRS has been planning and implementing a transition away from the original COBOL for over 20 years. That initiative, known as the Customer Account Data Engine (CADE), was launched in 2000 to replace the IMF and deliver a faster, more flexible system that could support real-time processing. According to a 2024 Congressional Research Service Report, CADE 1 ran into early trouble - delays, vendor issues, scope creep - and was shelved in 2009. Its successor, CADE 2, showed more promise but stalled, slowed by unstable funding and shifting political priorities.  Nevertheless, progress has occurred. According to a GAO report from March 2023, the IRS had completed major components of the Individual Tax Processing Engine and was preparing CADE 2 for broader testing. \n\nThese achievements remain partial, however, as modernization requires more than a one-time software upgrade. While DOGE may present this process as merely inefficient and project that they can do this better in a much shorter time, that is likely impossible. The IRS systems involve layers of complexities that come with operating at such a scale. There are intricate issues that require years of institutional knowledge - intimate understanding of the system in the context of the IRS and not just the expert technical know-how that some DOGE staffers may possess.\n\nAs Nathan has covered in his previous reporting on the Treasury payments system, the complexity of COBOL systems is widely misunderstood in general discourse and within modern tech industries. He explains: \"The issue with understanding and grasping a COBOL system is not knowing COBOL, as a programming language, in the abstract... The issue is understanding the specific physical limitations of the system, the way that it interacts with the 'Business Logic' of the code, and a million other contextual factors.\" This shows why contextual and institutional knowledge is crucial. Modernizing these COBOL systems requires more than mere language syntax fluency. These systems have developed intricate internal business logics that constitute vital institutional knowledge. Consequently, retaining engineers and staff who possess this knowledge and can train new engineers familiar with COBOL is an integral part of any successful modernization process.\n\nWhy this contextual knowledge matters is easily exemplified by the story behind a widespread misconception about social security beneficiaries. Contrary to claims amplified by Elon Musk, thousands of deceased individuals are not receiving benefits. The reality is far more mundane: early COBOL dialects handled null values poorly, so when someone applied for social security with a missing birth date, engineers implemented a specific date as a placeholder. They chose May 20, 1875 - the anniversary of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures' creation. Thus, while records might appear to show 150-year-old people receiving payments, the reality is entirely different and far less sensational. Yet, as Notes on the Crises covered in late April, these misconceptions have had profound consequences as DOGE moved millions of people to Social Security Administration’s “Death Master File”\n\nThis context of chronic and inconsistent funding, as well as the need for institutional knowledge, matters. DOGE now positions itself as the savior of an intentionally starved system. However, they’re doing so without the humility or historical understanding that modernization requires.\n\nThe challenges of modernization are not limited to external factors. IRS career staff we spoke with described a deep internal tension: while many recognize the agency’s outdated infrastructure, they’ve also grown wary, if not defensive, about change. This defensiveness isn’t irrational. The civil service has kept the IRS running despite a decades-long war of attrition, where budget cuts and political attacks have left it operating under siege. Staff described a churn of political appointees at Treasury arriving every few years, launching ambitious reform plans, and then departing before implementation, leaving half-built systems and institutional fatigue in their wake.\n\nThis constant disruption has created a culture that prizes internal stability, process, and procedure,  sometimes to a fault. As some staff acknowledged, parts of the agency have accumulated administrative bloat and redundancies over time, not because of modernization but due to the uneven political targeting of different IRS functions. Over the past few decades, enforcement divisions, taxpayer assistance programs, and IT infrastructure have all faced rolling waves of political scrutiny and budget cuts, while other areas remained untouched. This has created a patchwork organizational structure, where some offices are understaffed, while others carry redundant roles that once served as safeguards against chronic instability. \n\nThis raises a deeper question: if the IRS is essential political infrastructure and central to the functioning of the entire fiscal state, should it be subject to annual political fights over appropriations at all? Modernization can’t succeed if it remains hostage to short-term political cycles. What’s needed is structural commitment: stable funding, institutional continuity, and governance mechanisms that treat the IRS not as a punching bag, but as core democratic infrastructure. DOGE’s narrative ignores decades of defunded effort, bureaucratic workarounds, and congressional gridlock and pretends modernization failure was solely a product of technical incompetence rather than political constraint.\n\n\nLessons from the VA, the 1985 Tax Season, and DOGE’s “MUNCHABLE” Debacle\n\nModernization done right is incremental, transparent, and cautious. One of the clearest historical lessons comes from the IRS itself. In 1985, a rushed update to its computing system caused one of the worst tax seasons in U.S. history. Refunds were delayed for months. Erroneous notices were mailed to millions of Americans. Lines at local IRS offices stretched out the door. Congress was flooded with constituent complaints, and the crisis led to a series of internal audits and public hearings. That episode became known as the “tax season from hell.” It was a cautionary tale about the risks of rushed reform - an example of how modernization without governance can backfire. \n\nRecent events at other agencies have already demonstrated the dangers of hasty implementation. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, a DOGE staffer rapidly developed an AI tool to identify supposedly \"non-essential\" private company services, labeling them as \"MUNCHABLE.\" This resulted in the termination of nearly 600 contracts. When confronted about the errors, the DOGE staffer dismissed concerns, telling ProPublica, \"I’m sure mistakes were made. Mistakes are always made.\" The consequences of this cavalier approach proved severe. Among the terminated contracts were truly essential services, including maintenance for a gene sequencing device crucial for cancer treatment research, blood sample analysis for VA research projects, and tools designed to enhance nursing care quality.\n\nWith DOGE’s entrance into the IRS, the specter of catastrophic system-wide failure certainly looms large. The cautionary tale of 1985 still haunts the IRS. Given today's exponentially more complex tax systems and transaction volumes, DOGE's aggressive timeline and contempt for institutional knowledge could trigger a meltdown that makes 1985 look like a minor glitch.  IRS staff we interviewed described the MUNCHABLE episode as a “canary in the coal mine” for what could happen if similar tools were unleashed on taxpayer data or IRS operations.\n\nThe IRS cannot afford such recklessness. A single misstep in the system that processes refunds, verifies identity, or tracks withholding could delay paychecks, trigger false audits, or compromise vast swaths of sensitive personal data. DOGE’s insistence on speed and dismissal of internal IRS expertise doesn’t just increase the risk of failure. It makes failure all but inevitable.\n\nMeanwhile, additional risks have emerged around DOGE’s broader digital ambitions. Multiple sources flagged DOGE’s parallel effort to develop a “mega API” - a centralized interface intended to integrate IRS data with other federal databases. While framed as an efficiency tool, staff expressed alarm that it could enable cross-agency data sharing without adequate safeguards, including possible tracking of migrant populations, nonprofit activity, and union operations. These concerns echo broader patterns in administrative surveillance, where modernization rhetoric has historically masked new capacities for control. There are also growing concerns from staff about undocumented system changes and the possible removal of legacy records, raising alarms about data governance, audit integrity, and long-term institutional continuity. Thus far, DOGE has declined to respond to multiple FOIA requests or provide detailed documentation of these efforts, citing national security and cybersecurity exemptions. As oversight bodies begin to take notice, the opacity itself has become a warning sign.\n\nFinally, while DOGE insists their mission is public service, several technologists and policy staff we spoke with raised red flags about the expanding role of private contractors, especially high-profile firms like Palantir. Though not formally disclosed, report  suggest Palantir may be involved in early-stage backend integration or pilot analysis projects. If true, this marks a significant shift in how IRS data is governed and who has access to the informational backbone of the American tax system.\n\n\nWhat Real Reform Requires: Governance, Continuity, and Public Infrastructure\n\nThere’s no question that the IRS needs modernization. A progressive vision of IRS reform begins with a simple premise: public systems should be built to serve the public, not to impress venture capitalists or mimic the latest private-sector trends. That means modernization must be led by public interest technologists, not external disruptors with limited institutional knowledge and no stake in long-term stewardship. It also means investing in people, not just software. One of DOGE’s most dangerous moves has been to sideline or push out experienced IRS staff, including COBOL engineers and IT veterans who understand legacy systems' logic, dependencies, and vulnerabilities. These people are not relics. They are keepers of institutional memory, and any transition plan that ignores their insight risks erasing critical knowledge that cannot be recovered.\n\nModernization must also be incremental and dual-tracked. That means running new systems alongside old ones until full interoperability is confirmed. It requires building in redundancy, not stripping it out. It requires regulatory oversight, including privacy reviews, public documentation, and congressional reporting. And yes, it requires real money - multi-year funding, not patchwork grants or short-term political windfalls. Security concerns around COBOL are real, but they’re not insurmountable. Most are not about the language itself but about hardware constraints, vendor deprecation, and decades of deferred maintenance. TIGTA has noted that while COBOL systems present challenges, many vulnerabilities stem from funding shortfalls for patching and hardware upgrades, not the language itself. These are problems of political will, not just code architecture.","html":"<p><em>This is the second installment in the Notes on the Crises series on the IRS.

This oversight gap is especially troubling as they prepare to undertake their next ambitious project: a complete rewrite of legacy systems written in Assembly Code and COBOL - programming languages that form the foundation of many critical government functions.</p><h2 id=\"the-cobol-gambit\"><strong>The COBOL Gambit</strong></h2><p>It’s important to note that IRS modernization was underway long before DOGE arrived. The agency has spent years attempting to upgrade legacy systems and gradually phase out older programming languages like COBOL. What DOGE is attempting is not modernization in principle, but modernization at reckless speed, divorced from institutional knowledge and technical prudence.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hackathon-irs-data-palantir/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Wired Reporting</u></a> indicates an alarmingly naive plan to convert decades of critical COBOL code to Java through a 30-day “hackathon”, yet the true scope and timeline of this risky undertaking remain opaque. While the project's exact details are murky, their messaging suggests an unprecedented urgency in modernization efforts. In a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/doge-deputy-treasury-secretary-dish-crusade-pull-irs-out-its-really-big-hole?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>March FOX News appearance,</u></a> Sam Corcos (representing DOGE), alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant, launched<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/doge-deputy-treasury-secretary-dish-crusade-pull-irs-out-its-really-big-hole?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> targeted criticisms</a> of the IRS's legacy systems. Bessent <a href=\"https://x.com/SeccScotBessent/status/1925641077932904477?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>amplified</u></a> these claims,<a href=\"https://x.com/SeccScotBessent/status/1925641077932904477?ref=crisesnotes.com\"> declaring</a> on social media that the IRS modernization program lags 35 years behind schedule. Corcos is now a Treasury political appointee who serves as the agency’s Chief Information Officer. A career civil servant previously held that role.&nbsp;</p><p>This rushed rhetoric perfectly exemplifies DOGE's toxic combination of technical hubris and institutional recklessness. Despite repeated inquiries from oversight bodies and the press and urgent warnings from veteran civil servants, Treasury and the IRS maintain radio silence on the details of this unprecedented system overhaul, keeping taxpayers and Congress blind to changes that could potentially devastate America's tax infrastructure.</p><h2 id=\"a-history-of-%E2%80%9Cmodernization%E2%80%9D-and-what-we%E2%80%99ve-already-tried\"><strong>A History of “Modernization” and What We’ve Already Tried</strong></h2><p>Modernizing the IRS or any current government system is not a one-time software upgrade; it’s a multiyear institutional overhaul requiring stable funding, cross-agency coordination, and continuous technical labor. It also means maintaining dual systems for extended periods to ensure continuity for internal operations and taxpayer use, which is an expensive but necessary measure. What failed in the past wasn’t the vision of modernization but the refusal to consistently fund and maintain it. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), and the National Taxpayer Advocate have all stated the same thing for years: the IRS cannot modernize without multi-year, predictable investments.</p><p>GAO reports dating back to the early 2000s have flagged the absence of long-term funding as an impediment to the agency’s modernization goals. The National Taxpayer Advocate has echoed this repeatedly, noting in a 2019 <a href=\"https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ARC19_Volume1.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>report</u></a> that the IRS’s Business Systems Modernization program was delayed not by poor planning, but by the piecemeal and inconsistent nature of congressional appropriations. This is not a controversial opinion by any stretch. In fact, the private sector consistently emphasizes multi-year stable funding as a necessary condition for most projects, especially large-scale IT initiatives. There are many examples of multi-year stable funding being the prerequisite for success. JP Morgan invested over<a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/payments/acquiring-and-e-commerce/digitalization-a-strategic-priority?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> $12 billion</u></a> every year for many years, resulting in the successful modernization of legacy systems and the development of new digital banking platforms.</p><p>The IRS's technology investment funding has seen many ups and downs since Congress's establishment of the Information Technology Investment Account in FY 1997. These funding levels fall far short of what private companies spend on system improvements, despite government agencies serving millions more people and facing higher costs and consequences of service disruptions. The spending categories vary over the years, but we can consistently identify the Business Systems Modernization category that clearly shows fluctuating <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-costs-incurred-by-budget-activity-irs-data-book-table-32?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>modernization spending</u></a> between 2006 and 2022. Before the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding in 2023, business system modernization spending peaked at $468 million (2024 $) in 2011 and reached its lowest point at $309 million (2024 $) in 2018. Following the IRA allocation, spending increased dramatically to $926 million (2024 $) in 2023 and $1.3 billion (current $) in 2024 for system modernization, not including Direct File and certain other specific expenditures.</p><p><strong>Agency staff we interviewed</strong> recognized this need for stable multi-year funding. Many expressed appreciation for the increased IRA spending and advocated for ways to maintain higher funding levels even after the IRA funds expire, noting that this influx had been instrumental in advancing several critical projects. Despite these challenges and contrary to DOGE's positioning as pioneers in recognizing the IRS's technological needs, the reality is that the agency has been actively pursuing modernization for over six decades. As we said earlier, there have been mixed results, not because of government inertia but because of <strong>political neglect and chronic underfunding</strong>.</p><p>Beyond the funding and political challenges we discuss above, there is a fundamental misunderstanding about what IRS modernization entails - specifically, which aspects need modernization, the best path forward, and which elements have already been acknowledged and are being addressed versus what new components DOGE is introducing.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"what-does-modernizing-the-irs-entail\"><strong>What does modernizing the IRS entail?</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>At its core, IRS modernization represents an overhaul of technical infrastructure and taxpayer services. This approach addresses both internal operations and public-facing capabilities. Like many other organizations with legacy systems, the IRS faced a major IT challenge: the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/fs-99-07.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Y2K project</u></a> - a massive undertaking to address the problem with the year 2000. This issue stemmed from the way dates were stored in computer systems, using two digits for the year instead of four, which meant that when the calendar turned to 2000, systems might interpret \"00\" as 1900 rather than 2000. A more recent example of modernization effort on the public-facing side is the introduction of <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/filing/irs-direct-file-for-free?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Direct File</u></a>, which was launched as a pilot program in 2024 to offer eligible taxpayers a free, government-provided tax filing option that simplifies the process and eliminates the need for third-party software.</p><p>But for the most part, the IRS has focused on modernizing its core infrastructure by gradually replacing COBOL and Assembly Language Code systems, especially within the Individual Master File (IMF). The IMF is the oldest operating database in the federal government, conceptualized in 1959 and developed in <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/newsroom/irs-history-timeline_march-2019.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>1962</u></a> using Assembly Language Code and COBOL. IMF remains the authoritative system for tracking every individual taxpayer’s account activity: income, credits, payments, and refunds. Legacy systems written in COBOL and Assembly Language—many still operational—form the backbone of tax processing infrastructure. While DOGE officials claim to be replacing Assembly code with Java, COBOL-based systems were reportedly being migrated to new compilers or systems known as RM/COBOL which was also being implemented at the <a href=\"https://oig.treasury.gov/system/files/2024-11/oig25005%20%28508%29.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Bureau of the Fiscal Service</u></a>. A major advantage of RM/COBOLis that it makes the code platform agnostic, allowing it to run on platforms other than large powerful computing systems such as mainframes. To be clear, the details that have come out about DOGE’s efforts are murky and contradictory while it is difficult to get clarity on what exactly they are either doing, or even claiming to do.</p><p>The IRS has been <a href=\"https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF12525.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\">planning and implementing</a> a transition away from the original COBOL for over 20 years. That initiative, known as the Customer Account Data Engine (CADE), was launched in 2000 to replace the IMF and deliver a faster, more flexible system that could support real-time processing. According to a <a href=\"https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF12525.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>2024 Congressional Research Service Report</u></a>, CADE 1 ran into early trouble - delays, vendor issues, scope creep - and was shelved in 2009. Its successor, CADE 2, showed more promise but stalled, slowed by unstable funding and shifting political priorities.&nbsp; Nevertheless, progress has occurred. According to a<u> </u><a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106566.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>GAO report</u></a><u> from March 2023</u>, the IRS had completed major components of the Individual Tax Processing Engine and was preparing CADE 2 for broader testing.&nbsp;</p><p>These achievements remain partial, however, as modernization requires more than a one-time software upgrade. While DOGE may present this process as merely inefficient and project that they can do this better in a much shorter time, <strong>that is likely impossible</strong>. The IRS systems involve layers of complexities that come with operating at such a scale. There are intricate issues that require years of institutional knowledge - intimate understanding of the system in the context of the IRS and not just the expert technical know-how that some DOGE staffers may possess.</p><p>As Nathan has<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"> covered</a> in his previous <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>reporting</u></a> on the Treasury payments system, the complexity of COBOL systems is widely misunderstood in general discourse and within modern tech industries. He explains: \"The issue with understanding and grasping a COBOL system is not knowing COBOL, as a programming language, in the abstract... The issue is understanding the specific physical limitations of the system, the way that it interacts with the 'Business Logic' of the code, and a million other contextual factors.\" This shows why contextual and institutional knowledge is crucial. Modernizing these COBOL systems requires more than mere language syntax fluency. These systems <strong>have developed intricate internal business logics that constitute vital institutional knowledge</strong>. Consequently, retaining engineers and staff who possess this knowledge and can train new engineers familiar with COBOL is an integral part of any successful modernization process.</p><p>Why this contextual knowledge matters is easily exemplified by the story behind a widespread misconception about social security beneficiaries. Contrary to claims<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891557463377490431?lang=en&ref=crisesnotes.com\"> <u>amplified</u></a> by Elon Musk, thousands of deceased individuals are not receiving benefits. The reality is far more mundane: early COBOL dialects handled null values poorly, so when someone applied for social security with a missing birth date, engineers implemented a specific date as a placeholder. They chose <a href=\"https://news.stthomas.edu/in-the-news-manjeet-rege-on-the-computer-programming-language-used-by-the-social-security-administration/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>May 20, 1875</u></a> - the anniversary of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures' creation. Thus, while records might appear to show 150-year-old people receiving payments, the reality is entirely different and far less sensational. Yet, as <em>Notes on the Crises</em> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-crisis-at-social-security-illustrates-elon-musk-and-doges-plan-explode-the-number-and-severity-of-improper-payments/\"><u>covered in late April</u></a>, these misconceptions have had profound consequences as DOGE moved millions of people to Social Security Administration’s “Death Master File”</p><p>This context of <strong>chronic and inconsistent funding</strong>, as well as the <strong>need for institutional knowledge</strong>, matters. DOGE now positions itself as the savior of an intentionally starved system. However, they’re doing so without the <strong>humility or historical understanding that modernization requires</strong>.</p><p>The challenges of modernization are not limited to external factors.<strong> IRS career staff we spoke with described a deep internal tension</strong>: while many recognize the agency’s outdated infrastructure, they’ve also grown wary, if not defensive, about change. This defensiveness isn’t irrational. The civil service has kept the IRS running despite a decades-long war of attrition, where budget cuts and political attacks have left it operating under siege. Staff described a churn of political appointees at Treasury arriving every few years, launching ambitious reform plans, and then departing before implementation, leaving half-built systems and institutional fatigue in their wake.</p><p>This constant disruption has created a culture that <strong>prizes internal stability, process, and procedure</strong>,&nbsp; sometimes to a fault. As some staff acknowledged, parts of the agency have accumulated administrative bloat and redundancies over time, not <strong>because of modernization but due to the uneven political targeting of different IRS functions</strong>. Over the past few decades, enforcement divisions, taxpayer assistance programs, and IT infrastructure have all faced rolling waves of political scrutiny and budget cuts, while other areas remained untouched. This has created a patchwork organizational structure, where some offices are understaffed, while others carry redundant roles that once served as safeguards against chronic instability.&nbsp;</p><p>This raises a deeper question: if the IRS is essential political infrastructure and central to the functioning of the entire fiscal state, should it be subject to annual political fights over appropriations at all? Modernization can’t succeed if it remains hostage to short-term political cycles. What’s needed is structural commitment: stable funding, institutional continuity, and governance mechanisms that treat the IRS not as a punching bag, but as core democratic infrastructure. DOGE’s narrative ignores decades of defunded effort, bureaucratic workarounds, and congressional gridlock and pretends modernization failure was solely a product of technical incompetence rather than political constraint.</p><h2 id=\"lessons-from-the-va-the-1985-tax-season-and-doge%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cmunchable%E2%80%9D-debacle\"><strong>Lessons from the VA, the 1985 Tax Season, and DOGE’s “MUNCHABLE” Debacle</strong></h2><p>Modernization done right is incremental, transparent, and cautious. One of the clearest historical lessons comes from the IRS itself. In 1985, a rushed update to its computing system caused one of the worst tax seasons in U.S. history. Refunds were delayed for months. Erroneous notices were mailed to millions of Americans. Lines at local IRS offices stretched out the door. Congress was flooded with constituent complaints, and the crisis led to a series of internal audits and public hearings. That episode became known as the <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/5248369-a-warning-from-1985-the-tax-season-from-hell/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><strong><u>tax season from hell</u></strong></a><strong>.”</strong> It was a cautionary tale about the risks of rushed reform - an example of how modernization without governance can backfire.&nbsp;</p><p>Recent events at other agencies have already demonstrated the dangers of hasty implementation. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, a DOGE staffer rapidly developed an AI tool to identify supposedly \"non-essential\" private company services, labeling them as \"MUNCHABLE.\" This resulted in the termination of nearly 600 contracts. When confronted about the errors, the DOGE staffer dismissed concerns, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-doge-veterans-affairs-ai-contracts-health-care?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>telling</u> </a>ProPublica, \"I’m sure mistakes were made. Mistakes are always made.\" The consequences of this cavalier approach proved severe. Among the terminated contracts were truly essential services, including maintenance for a gene sequencing device crucial for cancer treatment research, blood sample analysis for VA research projects, and tools designed to enhance nursing care quality.</p><p>With DOGE’s entrance into the IRS, the specter of <strong>catastrophic system-wide failure certainly looms large</strong>. The cautionary tale of 1985 still haunts the IRS. Given today's exponentially more complex tax systems and transaction volumes, DOGE's aggressive timeline and contempt for institutional knowledge could trigger a meltdown that <strong>makes 1985 look like a minor glitch</strong>.&nbsp; IRS staff <strong>we interviewed described the MUNCHABLE episode as a “canary in the coal mine”</strong> for what could happen if similar tools were unleashed on taxpayer data or IRS operations.</p><p>The IRS cannot afford such recklessness. A single misstep in the system that processes refunds, verifies identity, or tracks withholding could delay paychecks, trigger false audits, or compromise vast swaths of sensitive personal data. DOGE’s insistence on speed and dismissal of internal IRS expertise doesn’t just increase the risk of failure. It makes failure all but inevitable.</p><p>Meanwhile, additional risks have emerged around DOGE’s broader digital ambitions. Multiple sources flagged DOGE’s parallel effort to develop a “<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hackathon-irs-data-palantir/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>mega API”</u></a> - a centralized interface intended to integrate IRS data with other federal databases. While framed as an efficiency tool, staff expressed alarm that it could enable cross-agency data sharing without adequate safeguards, including possible tracking of migrant populations, nonprofit activity, and union operations. These concerns echo broader patterns in administrative surveillance, where <strong>modernization rhetoric has historically masked new capacities for control</strong>. There are also growing concerns from staff about <strong>undocumented system changes and the possible removal of legacy records</strong>, raising alarms about data governance, audit integrity, and long-term institutional continuity. Thus far, DOGE has declined to respond to multiple FOIA requests or provide detailed documentation of these efforts, citing national security and cybersecurity exemptions. As oversight bodies begin to take notice, the opacity itself has become a warning sign.</p><p>Finally, while DOGE insists their mission is public service, several technologists and policy staff we spoke with raised red flags about the expanding role of private contractors, especially high-profile firms like Palantir. Though not formally disclosed, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-doge-irs-mega-api-data/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>report</u></a>&nbsp; suggest Palantir may be involved in early-stage backend integration or pilot analysis projects. If true, this marks a significant shift in how IRS data is governed and who has access to the informational backbone of the American tax system.</p><h2 id=\"what-real-reform-requires-governance-continuity-and-public-infrastructure\"><strong>What Real Reform Requires: Governance, Continuity, and Public Infrastructure</strong></h2><p>There’s no question that the IRS needs modernization. A progressive vision of IRS reform begins with a simple premise: public systems should be built to serve the public, not to impress venture capitalists or mimic the latest private-sector trends. That means modernization must be led by public interest technologists, not external disruptors with limited institutional knowledge and no stake in long-term stewardship. It also means investing in people, not just software. One of DOGE’s most dangerous moves has been to sideline or push out experienced IRS staff, including COBOL engineers and IT veterans who understand legacy systems' logic, dependencies, and vulnerabilities. These people are not relics. They are keepers of institutional memory, and any transition plan that ignores their insight risks erasing critical knowledge that cannot be recovered.</p><p>Modernization must also be incremental and dual-tracked. That means running new systems alongside old ones until full interoperability is confirmed. It requires building in redundancy, not stripping it out. It requires regulatory oversight, including privacy reviews, public documentation, and congressional reporting. And yes, it requires real money - multi-year funding, not patchwork grants or short-term political windfalls. Security concerns around COBOL are real, but they’re not insurmountable. Most are not about the language itself but about hardware constraints, vendor deprecation, and decades of deferred maintenance. TIGTA has noted that while COBOL systems present challenges, many vulnerabilities stem from funding shortfalls for patching and hardware upgrades, not the language itself. These are problems of political will, not just code architecture.</p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/inside-doges-dangerously-hasty-irs-modernization-plan/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"b36a8bd6-4f96-4934-ab21-63ccaae0fe31","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"68648d9e1693c60001ba646e","reading_time":14}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"June 12","id":"Ghost__Post__684a7989b3542f0001f70a51","title":"The Fiscal State Under Siege: Why People Hate the IRS, and Why You Should Care","slug":"the-fiscal-state-under-siege-why-people-hate-the-irs-and-why-you-should-care","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/06/IRS-series-1.png","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b80808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/dd075/IRS-series-1.png","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/715a6/IRS-series-1.png 398w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/fc129/IRS-series-1.png 796w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/dd075/IRS-series-1.png 1592w","sizes":"(min-width: 1592px) 1592px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/530b5/IRS-series-1.webp 398w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/a621f/IRS-series-1.webp 796w,\n/migrantinsider/static/b494df807d3b40db1eb9523d3e615b77/09728/IRS-series-1.webp 1592w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1592px) 1592px, 100vw"}]},"width":1592,"height":830}}},"excerpt":"How Trump, DOGE, and Project 2025 Are Turning the IRS Into a Tool of Authoritarian Rule\n\n\n\nEditor’s Introduction: Hello readers, it's Nathan Tankus and I am very happy to bring to you the first in a long multi-part series on the IRS spearheaded by Anisha Steephen.

And I love taxes. From mid-2021 through January 2025, I worked at the U.S. Treasury. Among many roles during my time there, I spent some time in the Office of Tax Policy, where I helped implement the tax provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. This is the first in a Notes on the Crises series that I, along with others, will be tackling about the IRS and taxes. In the weeks ahead, we’ll explore the agency transformation and the House Republicans’ disastrous reconciliation package that is unfolding right now. But first, we have to understand what taxation is — and why it’s always been about power. What’s below is an overview, then we will go in depth on many aspects as the series evolves. \n\n\nProject 2025 and the Structural Takeover\n\nIf you’ve read Project 2025, you know there was a plan. The authors laid out a blueprint to bring the IRS under greater executive control by infiltrating political appointees, gutting the civil service, and pushing an ambitious slate of regressive tax policies through Congress.\n\nWell, it’s happening.\n\nThe first public signal of chaos at the IRS came on February 17 when the Associated Press reported that DOGE was seeking access to the IRS’s Integrated Data Retrieval System—one of the most sensitive (I would argue the most sensitive) databases of personal information in the federal government. Privacy experts and lawmakers immediately sounded the alarm that this was no ordinary tech integration. It was a structural takeover.\n\nSince then, the chaos has only multiplied to include leadership purges, workforce cuts, and a DOGE-hosted IRS “hackathon.” These aren’t isolated incidents. They reflect a strategic campaign to transform the IRS into a politically partisan enforcement mechanism and a lever of executive power. \n\nThis goes far beyond just administrative disorder that is expected with any administration change, which would be concerning enough on its own. This is a systematic takeover of the federal government’s fiscal core. What’s at stake is not only the architecture of how the state sees, collects, and allocates public resources, but whether a functioning democracy can survive without it.\n\n\nWhy the IRS Matters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IRS sits at the center of the federal government’s fiscal architecture. As the financial nexus between the state and its residents, it facilitates the movement of trillions of dollars through the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. It enforces tax law, detects fraud, and has the authority to audit the ultra-wealthy to crack down on tax evasion that enables them to become even richer. The IRS does not write tax law, but enforces the code passed by Congress. Confusing the IRS with the architects of tax policy lets lawmakers off the hook. Its role is administrative, not factional, and that’s precisely what makes it so powerful. \n\nBut its role goes deeper. The IRS is not merely a tool of extraction: it can be a mechanism for redistribution, stabilization, and democratic investment. In Fiscal Year 2024, the IRS collected $4.9 trillion in taxes, which comprised 96% of total government revenue and was equivalent to 17% of GDP that year. When governed with public purpose, the IRS powers the fiscal machinery that sustains democracy itself by facilitating the spending that funds housing, healthcare, climate action, education, and income support that reaches millions. For example, In 2021 the IRS delivered over $100 billion in expanded Child Tax Credit payments. \n\nAt the beginning of this piece, when I say I love the IRS and taxes, I'm referring to these core social responsibilities, not to institutional permanence or bureaucratic tradition. The IRS is a vital institution, but it is not above critique. Studying it is essential, yet we must resist the impulse toward institutional reverence. This is especially important now, as agencies like the IRS grow increasingly susceptible to authoritarian encroachment. These institutions are not immutable moral authorities; they are only as democratic as the political forces that shape and control them.\n\nTo control the IRS is to control the operating system of the American state. That is precisely what makes this moment so dangerous. DOGE isn’t simply trying to dismantle the agency. It is trying to capture and rewire the IRS into a vehicle for executive dominance, privatized tax enforcement, and algorithmic control over public infrastructure. \n\nThis is not about eliminating bureaucracy, fraud, waste, or abuse. It’s about repurposing it to serve a new model of power and breaking the chain of democratic accountability between Congress, the law, and the public.  \n\n\nWhat Taxes Actually Are (And Why They’ve Always Been About Power and Control)\n\nTaxes are often portrayed as technocratic minutiae of statecraft—matters best left to accountants, economists, and congressional scorekeepers. But in truth, they are the lifeblood of state power.\n\nIn theory, taxes facilitate the provision of public goods and services: everything from national defense and infrastructure to schools and our social safety nets. Taxes come in many forms, including income taxes (on wages, salaries, and capital gains), consumption taxes (such as sales and excise taxes), property taxes, and corporate taxes. Taxes may be direct or indirect, progressive or regressive, visible or embedded in prices. No matter how they’re designed, taxes define the boundaries between the state and its people and the contours of political life. They determine who owes what to whom, and who gets to decide.\n\nThroughout history, taxation has functioned not merely as a means to help resource the government but as an instrument of visibility and control. Political theorist James C. Scott argued that states are often more motivated to tax in order to render societies legible in order to govern. Tax systems compel individuals to make themselves known to the state: declaring income, disclosing assets, and proving eligibility for social benefits. In doing so, they map economic life and assign political meaning to it. Taxes and tax policies create the conditions under which labor is counted, whose wealth is protected, and whose lives are monitored, audited, or excluded.\n\nPolitical economists have long recognized this dual function. Adam Smith, in The Wealth of Nations, emphasized that the sovereign’s survival depended on the ability to raise taxes efficiently and equitably. Marx saw taxation as one of many battlefields where class conflict played out over the distribution of social surplus. In the turmoil of the twentieth century, John Maynard Keynes emphasized taxation was- or could be- a tool for macroeconomic stabilization.  Piketty, working in the twenty-first century, warns that progressive taxation is essential to preventing the return of entrenched oligarchies. Legal realist Robert Hale, writing in the 1920s, argued that all income and property rights are upheld through coercive legal rules—and therefore taxation is not an intrusion on freedom but a foundational mechanism by which the state structures economic life. Even libertarians, though begrudgingly, concede taxation’s necessity to facilitate minimal state functions. These views span ideological terrain, but converge on one point: taxation is not merely math. It is a political infrastructure. It is how the state exercises power, asserts authority, and signals its priorities. In short, it is governance in its most distilled form.\n\n\nThe State’s Obligation to Its People \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxation defines what the state can see and, by extension, what it can control. In a democracy, that visibility is supposed to be reciprocal. If the state can see you, you should be able to shape what the state does in return. That mutual recognition is the only viable foundation of our social contract with the State. The American Colonists in their revolution understood this intuitively. Their demand was not against taxation itself, but against taxation without representation—a refusal to cede fiscal power to distant, unaccountable authorities. The colonists clashed with their British imperial counterparts and insisted that taxation be tethered to the democratic voice.\n\nAnd yet, U.S. tax policy has long prioritized extraction over equity. In its early years, the republic relied heavily on regressive tariffs—taxes on imported goods that disproportionately burdened consumers, especially the poor, while shielding elites. For example, the 1790s federal revenue system was primarily concentrated on duties for goods like sugar, salt, and textiles, staples that made up a large share of working-class consumption. Meanwhile, wealthy landowners and merchants, who benefited from domestic production and trade, paid little by comparison.\n\nEfforts to create a more equitable fiscal order, like those proposed by Thomas Paine, were largely ignored. Paine, recognizing the dangers of concentrated wealth, advocated for what we would now call a wealth tax: a 100% marginal tax on estates above a certain threshold. In his view, taxation was not just an instrument of state power—it was a means to dismantle economic hierarchy and protect political equality. The Civil War briefly disrupted the tradition of regressive taxation. The Union introduced the first federal income tax, an extraordinary expansion of the Treasury’s infrastructure and fiscal capacity. The ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 made that authority permanent, embedding the principle that those who benefit most from the economic system should contribute proportionally to its upkeep. In theory, it marked a new democratic fiscal compact.\n\nBut in practice, that compact has always been contested by the elite. The U.S. tax system has long operated as a machine of selective visibility. Today, working-class Americans are subject to invasive scrutiny. They must document their income, family structure, and eligibility for basic social benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit. Meanwhile, the wealthy conceal assets in trusts, shell corporations, and offshore accounts. This asymmetry is not accidental: it is a structural feature of the fiscal state, built on political choices about who must be accountable and who is allowed to remain invisible. Taxation, in this system, reinforces hierarchies of obligation where the poor are tethered to bureaucratic surveillance, while the rich rig the system to float above it.\n\nThat class betrayal extends beyond the collection of taxes to how the Federal Government’s budget is designed. While working-class communities are urged to see tax paying as a civic virtue, they receive little in return. The essential services that taxes are (in theory) meant to make possible—public education, housing, and healthcare—remain systematically underinvested. At the same time, public dollars finance militarized policing, mass incarceration, and global warfare. For many Black and brown Americans, paying taxes means giving up purchasing power while governments, corporations, and the wealthy use this country’s fiscal apparatus to sustain a bureaucratic machinery of broader oppression and marginalization. The fiscal system doesn’t just deepen state control over daily life—it entangles citizens in state violence, without offering them protection in return.\n\nThis is why debates over tax policy are never just about money, and why more people should be paying attention. They are about visibility, legitimacy, and power—about who the government chooses to see, to trust, and ultimately, to protect or to punish. The IRS, then, in its role administering tax policy, is not and has never been a neutral bureaucratic entity. It is the institutional expression of political economy—a mechanism that enforces who must justify their presence in the fiscal order. Its failures reflect political choices, but so do its successes. When aligned with democratic goals, the IRS can function as a pillar of economic justice, making visible the invisible, delivering benefits directly to the people, and ensuring that those who extract the most from society contribute their fair share.\n\nTaxation is therefore not just a tool of technocratic administration; it is the terrain of democratic struggle. And while that struggle has always been fraught, today it is perilous. \n\n\nThe IRS and Its Current Political Transformation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IRS, as the institution that we know, took shape during the Civil War, but its modern incarnation grew alongside the rise of the 20th-century administrative state. As federal responsibilities expanded, so did the need for an agency capable of managing the government’s most powerful claim over its citizens: the power to tax. Over the decades, the IRS became both an indispensable and a deeply resented bureaucratic punching bag for anti-government sentiment. Though often blamed for the tax system’s outcomes, the IRS does not write the rules—it enforces the tax code passed by Congress. This administrative role makes it structurally nonpartisan, yet politically vulnerable.\n\nThe IRS is not just another federal agency. It is supposed to enforce tax laws impartially based on statutes passed by Congress. That mandate was tested—and violated—during the Nixon administration. In the early 1970s, President Nixon ordered the IRS to audit his political opponents, civil rights activists, and journalists, weaponizing the agency for personal and ideological retaliation. The resulting scandal led to the creation of Section 7217 of the Internal Revenue Code, which explicitly prohibits executive branch officials, including the president, from interfering in IRS audits or administration. This firewall was designed to safeguard the agency’s independence and, by extension, the democratic legitimacy of the tax system itself.\n\nHowever, the assault on the IRS did not end with Nixon. In the decades that followed, it became a central target of conservative movements intent on dismantling the federal state. The Reagan era marked a turning point. As the gospel of small government and supply-side economics took hold, efforts to defund, discredit, and destabilize the IRS intensified. The 1990s brought relentless anti-tax rhetoric, and the 2010s delivered defunding and institutional decline. Between 2010 and 2022, Congress slashed the IRS budget by over 20%, leading to the loss of more than 20,000 employees (including auditors, investigators, and IT specialists) as basic customer service collapsed under the weight of chronic understaffing.\n\nIn that same period, enforcement against the wealthy all but virtually disappeared. According to economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the top 1% of U.S. earners evaded roughly $160 billion in taxes annually.  Meanwhile, audits of low-income taxpayers, especially those claiming refundable credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit, surged. A 2023 Quarterly Journal of Economics study, using IRS data from 2010 to 2018, found that Black taxpayers were audited at nearly five times the rate of non-Black taxpayers. This wasn’t because they were more likely to commit fraud, but because their returns were simpler and cheaper to audit. During years of budget cuts, the IRS leaned on algorithms that prioritized efficiency over fairness. The result was a classist and racialized audit and enforcement system built for speed and to protect the wealthy. \n\nThe Biden administration hoped to reverse course by restoring the IRS’s capacity to serve the public. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 secured nearly $80 billion in new funding aimed at modernizing technology, rebuilding the workforce, and ensuring that tax enforcement was applied to the wealthy as well as the poor. The New York Times recently reported that the IRS upheld Biden’s pledge to increase audits but only on the wealthy. Those efforts have now largely been halted.\n\nThese decades of targeting the IRS weren’t just an attack on one agency. They were an attack on the state’s ability to govern fairly. A well-resourced IRS is more than a bureaucratic necessity; it is democratic infrastructure. It enables the equal enforcement of the law, the redistribution of wealth, and the delivery of public goods. Fiscal fairness becomes impossible when that capacity is gutted, and democracy becomes performative. The IRS wasn’t neglected by conservatives: it has been meticulously redesigned to concentrate power and wealth along lines of class and race. Its mission was retooled to be less a guardian of the public interest and more a servant of market discipline. \n\nAnd today, that project is entering a new and far more dangerous phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy a Paid Subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump, DOGE,  and the New Model of Fiscal Control\n\nUnder the Trump administration, DOGE has aggressively intervened in the IRS by seeking access to sensitive taxpayer data, orchestrating mass layoffs, and eliminating public-friendly programs like Direct File. They don’t want to just dismantle the IRS. They want to further rewire it, transforming a civic institution into a political instrument. In this vision, taxation is no longer a shared obligation but a mechanism of ideological enforcement. Surveillance becomes the method, and loyalty to the president the metric. This transformation is rooted in the logic of new public management—a technocratic framework that reshapes public institutions to resemble private firms: lean, automated, data-driven, and detached from democratic accountability. \n\nThis shift doesn’t just weaken the IRS. It bypasses the democratic infrastructure that’s supposed to govern it. What was once a chain of accountability—from lawmaking to enforcement to public benefit—is now being rerouted through executive command and algorithmic control. Under this model, the IRS ceases to be a steward of fiscal democracy and instead morphs into an engine of information extraction: surveilling the public, enforcing hierarchy, and concentrating power.\n\nThe consequences are already visible: the IRS’s agreement to share confidential taxpayer data with ICE has raised alarms about privacy and the agency's role in enforcement beyond taxation; and the threatened revocations of nonprofit status for universities, climate organizations, and racial justice groups—justified under the guise of fiscal scrutiny—are not neutral acts of enforcement. They are party-focused interventions, using the tax code to intimidate critics and constrain dissent. \n\nWe’ve seen this before, and it should scare us. In countries like Hungary and Rwanda, governments have turned tax authorities into instruments of repression—not by banning civil society outright, but by burying it in audits, compliance demands, and legal ambiguity. Bureaucratic coercion becomes a substitute for overt censorship. The United States is now testing the contours of that same strategy: deploying regulatory pressure to erode opposition, cloaking political retaliation in administrative form, and transforming fiscal policy into a weapon of ideological discipline.\n\nWhat’s also being lost in all of this is not just IRS institutional expertise or workforce capacity. It’s the legitimacy of the social contract: the idea that taxation is a collective democratic function. DOGE’s approach echoes a system where data is extracted not to serve the public, but to entrench private and executive power. In this framework, the IRS no longer upholds civic duty, but instead enforces obedience. Public authority remains, but democratic accountability disappears.\n\n\nIf You Control the Tax Code and the IRS, You Control the State and The People\n\nThis isn’t just bureaucratic reshuffling. It’s a battle over the very structure of American democracy. The IRS, as the engine of fiscal governance, is being gutted, rewired, and weaponized. While Congress still (in theory) formally holds the power of the purse, control over how tax laws are enforced and against whom is increasingly shifting to the executive branch. And the tax code, once a tool for potential shared investment, is being further entrenched as a shield for elite impunity.\n\nIf a sitting president can direct the IRS to investigate political enemies, revoke nonprofit status from dissenting institutions, or selectively enforce tax law to reward loyalty, the agency no longer serves the public. It serves power. The slow hollowing of the IRS through funding cuts, staff attrition, and the erosion of norms yields the same result: a weakened institution unable to enforce the law, uphold equity, or hold the powerful to account.\n\nAnd when that happens, the disparities baked into our fiscal system deepen. The rich, already shielded by armies of tax lawyers and offshore vehicles, become even more invisible to enforcement. Meanwhile, the working class, especially Black and brown taxpayers, are subject to increased scrutiny and bureaucratic punishment. When Nixon overstepped, Congress stepped in. But today, a deeply polarized legislature, decades of executive aggrandizement, and a judiciary increasingly deferential to presidential authority have eroded those checks. Now the stakes are higher, not just because of the power being wielded, but because of whom that power targets and whom it protects.\n\nWe are no longer just watching a system decay. We are watching it be consolidated to serve private power, silence dissent, and reverse the very idea of democratic taxation. It’s a constitutional breakdown. If the IRS falls, we won’t just lose an agency; we’ll lose one of the last institutional expressions of democratic obligation. Taxation is not just how we keep a number of key infrastructures running—it is how we declare what we value, who we protect, and who must answer to the public. The IRS reflects that social contract, however imperfectly, and not without deep bias. But unlike some other federal institutions, its mandate remains tenuously anchored in public law and congressional oversight. It is one of the few places where the struggle over fiscal accountability is still active and, for now, structurally possible.\n\nWe don’t need to defend what the IRS has been. We need to fight for what it could be: a mechanism of equity, not control by the elite. And accountability, not surveillance. But if we allow it to collapse—or worse, to be captured for authoritarianism—we may wake up in a country where taxation still exists, but democracy does not.","html":"<h2 id=\"how-trump-doge-and-project-2025-are-turning-the-irs-into-a-tool-of-authoritarian-rule\">How Trump, DOGE, and Project 2025 Are Turning the IRS Into a Tool of Authoritarian Rule</h2><p></p><p><em>Editor’s Introduction: Hello readers, it's Nathan Tankus and I am very happy to bring to you the first in a long multi-part series on the IRS spearheaded by Anisha Steephen.

In short, it is governance in its most distilled form.</p><h3 id=\"the-state%E2%80%99s-obligation-to-its-people\"><strong>The State’s Obligation to Its People&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-grey kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Buy a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>Taxation defines what the state can see and, by extension, what it can control. In a democracy, that visibility is supposed to be reciprocal. If the state can see you, you should be able to shape what the state does in return. That mutual recognition is the only viable foundation of our social contract with the State. The American Colonists in their revolution understood this intuitively. Their demand was not against taxation itself, but against taxation <em>without representation</em>—a refusal to cede fiscal power to distant, unaccountable authorities. The colonists clashed with their British imperial counterparts and insisted that taxation be tethered to the democratic voice.</p><p>And yet, U.S. tax policy has long prioritized extraction over equity. In its early years, the republic relied heavily on regressive tariffs—taxes on imported goods that disproportionately burdened consumers, especially the poor, while shielding elites. For example, the 1790s federal revenue system was primarily concentrated on duties for goods like sugar, salt, and textiles, staples that made up a large share of working-class consumption. Meanwhile, wealthy landowners and merchants, who benefited from domestic production and trade, paid little by comparison.</p><p>Efforts to create a more equitable fiscal order, like those proposed by Thomas Paine, were largely ignored. Paine, recognizing the dangers of concentrated wealth, advocated for what we would now call a wealth tax: a 100% marginal tax on estates above a certain threshold. In his view, taxation was not just an instrument of state power—it was a means to dismantle economic hierarchy and protect political equality. The Civil War briefly disrupted the tradition of regressive taxation. The Union introduced the first federal income tax, an extraordinary expansion of the Treasury’s infrastructure and fiscal capacity. The ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 made that authority permanent, embedding the principle that those who benefit most from the economic system should contribute proportionally to its upkeep. In theory, it marked a new democratic fiscal compact.</p><p>But in practice, that compact has always been contested by the elite. The U.S. tax system has long operated as a machine of <em>selective visibility</em>. Today, working-class Americans are subject to invasive scrutiny. They must document their income, family structure, and eligibility for basic social benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit. Meanwhile, the wealthy conceal assets in trusts, shell corporations, and offshore accounts. This asymmetry is not accidental: it is a structural feature of the fiscal state, built on political choices about who must be accountable and who is allowed to remain invisible. Taxation, in this system, reinforces hierarchies of obligation where the poor are tethered to bureaucratic surveillance, while the rich rig the system to float above it.</p><p>That class betrayal extends beyond the collection of taxes to how the Federal Government’s budget is designed. While working-class communities are urged to see tax paying as a civic virtue, they receive little in return. The essential services that taxes are (in theory) meant to make possible—public education, housing, and healthcare—remain systematically underinvested. At the same time, public dollars finance militarized policing, mass incarceration, and global warfare. For many Black and brown Americans, paying taxes means giving up purchasing power while governments, corporations, and the wealthy use this country’s fiscal apparatus to sustain a bureaucratic machinery of broader oppression and marginalization. The fiscal system doesn’t just deepen state control over daily life—it entangles citizens in state violence, without offering them protection in return.</p><p>This is why debates over tax policy are never just about money, and why more people should be paying attention. They are about visibility, legitimacy, and power—about who the government chooses to see, to trust, and ultimately, to protect or to punish. The IRS, then, in its role administering tax policy, is not and has never been a neutral bureaucratic entity. It is the institutional expression of political economy—a mechanism that enforces who must justify their presence in the fiscal order. Its failures reflect political choices, but so do its successes. When aligned with democratic goals, the IRS can function as a pillar of economic justice, making visible the invisible, delivering benefits directly to the people, and ensuring that those who extract the most from society contribute their fair share.</p><p>Taxation is therefore not just a tool of technocratic administration; <em>it is the terrain of democratic struggle.</em> And while that struggle has always been fraught, today it is perilous.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"the-irs-and-its-current-political-transformation\"><strong>The IRS and Its Current Political Transformation</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-grey kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Buy a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<p>The IRS, as the institution that we know, took shape during the Civil War, but its modern incarnation grew alongside the rise of the 20th-century administrative state. As federal responsibilities expanded, so did the need for an agency capable of managing the government’s most powerful claim over its citizens: <strong>the power to tax.</strong> Over the decades, the IRS became both an indispensable and a deeply resented bureaucratic punching bag for anti-government sentiment. Though often blamed for the tax system’s outcomes, the IRS does not write the rules—it enforces the tax code passed by Congress. This administrative role makes it structurally nonpartisan, yet politically vulnerable.</p><p>The IRS is not just another federal agency. It is supposed to enforce tax laws impartially based on statutes passed by Congress. That mandate was tested—and violated—during the Nixon administration. In the early 1970s, President Nixon ordered the IRS to audit his political opponents, civil rights activists, and journalists, weaponizing the agency for personal and ideological retaliation. The resulting scandal led to the creation of Section 7217 of the Internal Revenue Code, which explicitly prohibits executive branch officials, including the president, from interfering in IRS audits or administration. This firewall was designed to safeguard the agency’s independence and, by extension, the democratic legitimacy of the tax system itself.</p><p>However, the assault on the IRS did not end with Nixon. In the decades that followed, it became a central target of conservative movements intent on dismantling the federal state. The Reagan era marked a turning point. As the gospel of small government and supply-side economics took hold, efforts to defund, discredit, and destabilize the IRS intensified. The 1990s brought relentless anti-tax rhetoric, and the 2010s delivered defunding and institutional decline. Between 2010 and 2022, Congress <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-irs-was-gutted?ref=crisesnotes.com#:~:text=administration%20of%20Barack%20Obama%2C%20the,Collections%20rebounded\"><u>slashed</u></a> the IRS budget by over 20%, leading to the loss of more than 20,000 employees (including auditors, investigators, and IT specialists) as basic customer service collapsed under the weight of chronic understaffing.</p><p>In that same period, enforcement against the wealthy all but virtually disappeared. According to economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the top 1% of U.S. earners evaded roughly $160 billion in taxes annually.&nbsp; Meanwhile, audits of low-income taxpayers, especially those claiming refundable credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit, surged. A 2023 <em>Quarterly Journal of Economics</em> study, using IRS data from 2010 to 2018, <a href=\"https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/working-paper/measuring-and-mitigating-racial-disparities-tax-audits?ref=crisesnotes.com#:~:text=novel%20partial%20identification%20strategy%20to,%282%29%20targeting%20erroneously%20claimed\"><u>found</u></a> that Black taxpayers were audited at nearly five times the rate of non-Black taxpayers. This wasn’t because they were more likely to commit fraud, but because their returns were simpler and cheaper to audit. During years of budget cuts, the IRS leaned on algorithms that prioritized efficiency over fairness. The result was a classist and racialized audit and enforcement system built for speed and to protect the wealthy.&nbsp;</p><p>The Biden administration hoped to reverse course by restoring the IRS’s capacity to serve the public. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 <a href=\"https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/irs-thinks-big-about-how-spend-80-billion?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>secured nearly $80 billion</u></a> in new funding aimed at modernizing technology, rebuilding the workforce, and ensuring that tax enforcement was applied to the wealthy as well as the poor. The New York Times recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/upshot/tax-audits-wealthy-biden-trump.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>reported</u></a> that the IRS upheld Biden’s pledge to increase audits but only on the wealthy. Those efforts have now largely been halted.</p><p>These decades of targeting the IRS weren’t just an attack on one agency. They were an attack on the state’s ability to govern fairly. A well-resourced IRS is more than a bureaucratic necessity; it is democratic infrastructure. It enables the equal enforcement of the law, the redistribution of wealth, and the delivery of public goods. Fiscal fairness becomes impossible when that capacity is gutted, and democracy becomes performative. The IRS wasn’t <strong>neglected </strong>by conservatives: it has been meticulously <strong>redesigned </strong>to concentrate power and wealth along lines of class and race. Its mission was <strong>retooled </strong>to be less a guardian of the public interest and more a <strong>servant of market discipline.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>And today, that project is entering a new and far more dangerous phase.</p>\n<div class=\"kg-card kg-cta-card kg-cta-bg-grey kg-cta-immersive    kg-cta-centered\" data-layout=\"immersive\">\n            \n            <div class=\"kg-cta-content\">\n                \n                \n                    <div class=\"kg-cta-content-inner\">\n                    \n                    \n                        <a href=\"#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-cta-button \" style=\"background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;\">\n                            Buy a Paid Subscription\n                        </a>\n                        \n                    </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n<h3 id=\"trump-doge-and-the-new-model-of-fiscal-control\"><strong>Trump, DOGE,&nbsp; and the New Model of Fiscal Control</strong></h3><p>Under the Trump administration, DOGE has aggressively intervened in the IRS by seeking access to sensitive taxpayer data, orchestrating mass layoffs, and eliminating public-friendly programs like <a href=\"https://fas.org/publication/end-of-irs-direct-file/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Direct File</u></a>. They don’t want to just dismantle the IRS. They want to further rewire it, transforming a civic institution into a political instrument. In this vision, taxation is no longer a shared obligation but a mechanism of ideological enforcement. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/opinion/musk-doge-data-ai.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Surveillance becomes the method</u></a>, and loyalty to the president the metric. This transformation is rooted in the logic of <em>new public management</em>—a technocratic framework that reshapes public institutions to resemble private firms: lean, automated, data-driven, and detached from democratic accountability.&nbsp;</p><p>This shift doesn’t just weaken the IRS. It bypasses the democratic infrastructure that’s supposed to govern it. What was once a chain of accountability—from lawmaking to enforcement to public benefit—is now being rerouted through executive command and algorithmic control. Under this model, the IRS ceases to be a steward of fiscal democracy and instead morphs into an engine of information extraction: surveilling the public, enforcing hierarchy, and concentrating power.</p><p>The consequences are already visible: the IRS’s <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/blog/irs-ice-agreement-weakening-privacy-protections-poses-risks-for-all-taxpayers?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>agreement</u></a> to share confidential taxpayer data with ICE has raised alarms about privacy and the agency's role in enforcement beyond taxation; and the threatened revocations of nonprofit status for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-exempt-status.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>universities,</u></a> climate organizations, and racial justice groups—justified under the guise of fiscal scrutiny—are not neutral acts of enforcement. They are <strong>party-focused interventions</strong>, using the tax code to intimidate critics and constrain dissent.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve seen this before, and it should scare us. In countries like Hungary and Rwanda, governments have turned tax authorities into instruments of repression—not by banning civil society outright, but by burying it in audits, compliance demands, and legal ambiguity. Bureaucratic coercion becomes a substitute for overt censorship. The United States is now testing the contours of that same strategy: deploying regulatory pressure to erode opposition, cloaking political retaliation in administrative form, and transforming fiscal policy into a weapon of ideological discipline.</p><p>What’s also being lost in all of this is not just IRS institutional expertise or workforce capacity. It’s the legitimacy of the social contract: the idea that taxation is a collective democratic function. DOGE’s approach echoes a system where data is extracted not to serve the public, but to entrench private and executive power. In this framework, the IRS no longer upholds civic duty, but instead enforces obedience. Public authority <strong>remains</strong>, but democratic accountability <strong>disappears</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"if-you-control-the-tax-code-and-the-irs-you-control-the-state-and-the-people\"><strong>If You Control the Tax Code and the IRS, You Control the State and The People</strong></h3><p>This isn’t just bureaucratic reshuffling. It’s a battle over the very structure of American democracy. The IRS, as the engine of fiscal governance, is being gutted, rewired, and weaponized. While Congress still (in theory) formally holds the power of the purse, control over how tax laws are enforced and against whom is increasingly shifting to the executive branch. And the tax code, once a tool for potential shared investment, is being further entrenched as a shield for elite impunity.</p><p>If a sitting president can direct the IRS to investigate political enemies, revoke nonprofit status from dissenting institutions, or selectively enforce tax law to reward loyalty, the agency no longer serves the public. It serves power. The slow hollowing of the IRS through funding cuts, staff attrition, and the erosion of norms yields the same result: a weakened institution unable to enforce the law, uphold equity, or hold the powerful to account.</p><p>And when that happens, the disparities baked into our fiscal system deepen. The rich, already shielded by armies of tax lawyers and offshore vehicles, become even more invisible to enforcement. Meanwhile, the working class, especially Black and brown taxpayers, are subject to increased scrutiny and bureaucratic punishment. When Nixon overstepped, Congress stepped in. But today, a deeply polarized legislature, decades of executive aggrandizement, and a judiciary increasingly deferential to presidential authority have eroded those checks. Now the stakes are higher, not just because of the power being wielded, but because of whom that power targets and whom it protects.</p><p>We are no longer just watching a system decay. We are watching it be consolidated to serve private power, silence dissent, and reverse the very idea of democratic taxation. It’s a constitutional breakdown. If the IRS falls, we won’t just lose an agency; we’ll lose one of the last institutional expressions of democratic obligation. Taxation is not just how we keep a number of key infrastructures running—it is how we declare what we value, who we protect, and who must answer to the public. The IRS reflects that social contract, however imperfectly, and not without deep bias. But unlike some other federal institutions, its mandate remains tenuously anchored in public law and congressional oversight. It is one of the few places where the struggle over fiscal accountability is still active and, for now, structurally possible.</p><p>We don’t need to defend what the IRS has been. We need to fight for what it could be: a mechanism of equity, not control by the elite. And accountability, not surveillance. But if we allow it to collapse—or worse, to be captured for authoritarianism—we may wake up in a country where taxation still exists, <strong>but democracy does not.</strong></p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-fiscal-state-under-siege-why-people-hate-the-irs-and-why-you-should-care/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"0ee75e51-9339-4b4f-b76d-c03f4b94c0d7","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"684a7989b3542f0001f70a51","reading_time":14}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"June 10","id":"Ghost__Post__68478f19496bc10001f18b9c","title":"The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” Eliminates the Office of Financial Research—Threatening the Stability of the Treasury Market","slug":"the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-eliminates-the-office-of-financial-research","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/06/OFR-gutting.png","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/f4d9ebf77c58d4e63f00d67da21cfe11/dd075/OFR-gutting.png","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/f4d9ebf77c58d4e63f00d67da21cfe11/715a6/OFR-gutting.png 398w,\n/migrantinsider/static/f4d9ebf77c58d4e63f00d67da21cfe11/fc129/OFR-gutting.png 796w,\n/migrantinsider/static/f4d9ebf77c58d4e63f00d67da21cfe11/dd075/OFR-gutting.png 1592w","sizes":"(min-width: 1592px) 1592px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/f4d9ebf77c58d4e63f00d67da21cfe11/530b5/OFR-gutting.webp 398w,\n/migrantinsider/static/f4d9ebf77c58d4e63f00d67da21cfe11/a621f/OFR-gutting.webp 796w,\n/migrantinsider/static/f4d9ebf77c58d4e63f00d67da21cfe11/09728/OFR-gutting.webp 1592w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1592px) 1592px, 100vw"}]},"width":1592,"height":830}}},"excerpt":"Early last week I started working on a piece on why the Federal Reserve didn’t step in during the Trump Tariff Financial Panic.

The basic idea of that piece is simply that “repo rates”- the interest rate at which you can, in essence, borrow funds with treasury securities as collateral- didn’t move outside of the Federal Reserve’s target range. In the language of Wall Street, the Federal Reserve didn’t step in because the “money market” didn’t meltdown. The Federal Reserve, as well as market participants themselves, knew the money market didn’t meltdown. But how did they know a meltdown wasn’t happening?\n\nSimply put: they had the data. Specifically they had the data, known under the name “Secured Overnight Financing Rate Data”, tracking both the volumes and prices in the repo market, published daily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Yet, under the surface, this data is less “New York Fed” than it seems. The FRBNY only collects one segment of the data. The rest comes from the Office of Financial Research, an entity within the United States Treasury created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill. \n\nWhich brings me to the main subject of this piece. On Wednesday, the Financial Times Alphaville blog did a piece entitled “Could Trump’s ‘big beautiful bill’ kill the OFR and accidentally sabotage SOFR?” This possibility was very alarming, so Thursday I put aside the other things I’ve been working on and devoted myself full time to talking to numerous sources about this important issue. There are many extremely important and concerning things going on during this still-ongoing constitutional crisis. However, the combination of the obscurity of this issue, its far-reaching importance, and the rare combination of financial, macroeconomic and legal knowledge needed to report on its various aspects adequately demanded detailed Notes on the Crises coverage.\n\nTo start then, let’s focus on Dodd-Frank. Specifically, the unique method by which the Office of Financial Research is funded. In an attempt to avoid being subject to annual appropriations—a perpetual concern here at Notes on the Crises—Dodd-Frank created a fee (referred to as an “assessment”) on the largest banks (known as “Systemically Important Financial Institutions”) as well as any banks with 250 billion dollars, or more, in assets. Collecting this leads to a positive balance in the “Financial Research Fund”. This “fund”, in turn, authorizes expenditures by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Office of Financial Research. To put things more precisely: the secretary of the Treasury (who is chairman of FSOC) proposes an FSOC budget each year. Then, if ratified by a majority of Financial Stability Oversight Council voting members, that becomes FSOC’s budget. The OFR director meanwhile determines OFR’s budget “in consultation” with the Treasury secretary (in practice they treat that “consultation” as a veto).  Both budget processes lead to expenditures that “debit” the Financial Research Fund. \n\nIn other words, we are back to the topic of accounting gimmicks. The Federal Government has all sorts of accounting gimmicks to distinguish different types of spending, even if payments ultimately flow out of the Bureau of Fiscal Service and the very same bank account. The point of this accounting gimmick is to avoid annual congressional appropriations fights. That means that for accounting purposes, the expenditures “come out” of this fund, rather than the “general fund”. But it's all public money. To be clear, I do not call this an “accounting gimmick” pejoratively. I think insulating financial regulators from annual appropriations is a good thing. It's just that trying to do so through avoiding the politics of government budgeting is self-defeating.\n\nEnter the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA if you have the stomach churning misfortune of having to work on congressional issues right now. As FT Alphaville first reported, the house legislation limits the “assessments” that can be levied. Specifically, it limits the assessments to a three year rolling average of the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s expenses. Excess sums that happen to be “in” the Financial Research Fund get “moved” to the general fund. Sweeping “money” from one “fund” to the general fund is an accounting gimmick, meant to limit the expenditures those “side funds” authorize. Thus, without ever even mentioning the Office of Financial Research, this provision implicitly moves its budget to zero. So much for avoiding annual congressional appropriations fights! Live by the accounting gimmick—die by it too.\n\nFT Alphaville was unsure whether this was an intentional move or not. The Republican Majority on the Senate Banking Committee released a press release Friday confirming that they were intentionally eliminating the “duplicative Office of Financial Research (OFR)”. According to sources I’ve talked to in the Senate, Republican committee members have shown little concern with the elimination of the Office of Financial Research. They also seem aware of the concerns over SOFR, because both their “one pager” and “section by section” documents claim their proposals are preserving financing for SOFR. Yet, this “preservation” is not in their legislative text proposal. Confusingly, the “section by section” document even claims, falsely, that their proposed legislative text “provides the Treasury Department with the necessary authority/funds to continue collecting data on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)”.\n\nThere are many reasons to doubt the Majority Senate Banking’s claims. For one thing, if they plan on replicating the OFR’s activities then the alleged budgetary savings would disappear. No one, not least the Congressional Budget Office, has estimated the cost of replicating OFR activities at “main Treasury”. Even if you took the CBO’s estimates at face value, the supposed reduction of the deficit is equivalent to 0.000001% of 2024 GDP per year. Those estimates also come from assuming that the elimination of the bank fees will lead to higher taxable bank income and thus increase corporate tax revenue (I’m not kidding). This is, to say the least, a highly questionable assumption. But let's pretend to take this seriously for a moment. Even if this were true, to call this generously estimated sum a rounding error would be too generous. This highly questionable budgetary saving is not remotely worth risking the stability of the financial system.\n\nBeyond the impracticability of replicating crucial Office of Financial Research activities while “saving money”, there are also various legal and logistical barriers to duplicating that work altogether. To understand the extreme difficulties involved I spoke to Stacey Schreft, who spent a decade as Deputy Director for Research and Analysis at the Office of Financial Research. Schreft only left OFR March 22nd of this year. This is how she summarized the various problems with transferring the OFR’s data collection efforts:\n\nThe Office of Financial Research is the only organization with the authority to collect its data on repurchase agreements from across market participants. The OFR has automated, fully audited pipelines for high-frequency data ingest, transformation, and validation from 80+ industry reporters. These connections are governed by tailored Memorandums of Understanding and interagency agreements, supported by the OFR’s statutory authorities. Transferring or modifying the authority, necessary agreements, and final rules for the OFR’s data collections would likely seriously delay or disrupt the collections. \n\nBut it gets worse. The OFR’s modern IT systems are separate from and stand in sharp contrast to the Treasury’s systems. My understanding is that Treasury could not just take over the collections tomorrow. It would need to take possession of the OFR’s infrastructure because its existing systems aren’t configured to process the kind of data the OFR collects, especially for things like the repo data intake and validation and quality checks. At a time when there has been much talk about the need to modernize federal IT systems to make the government more efficient, defunding the OFR, with its state-of-the-art systems, and moving its data collections elsewhere, especially to Treasury, seems to make little sense.\n\nFinally, the OFR’s analysts and technologists possess unique expertise in financial market structure, repo markets, counterparty risk, and systemic data modeling. These aren’t general-purpose skill sets easily transferred or replicated elsewhere. While FSOC members have technology and research units (or had research units, as many of those units have been or are slated to be eliminated or drastically reduced), none is resourced or mandated to fulfill the OFR’s statutory duties. The OFR’s data stewardship, validation, and transparency mandates are central to collecting data for FSOC and its members and monitoring systemic risk.\n\nIn other words, I am extremely skeptical that the work of the OFR will be readily replicated elsewhere. And I worry that, if this provision becomes law, crucial data about repo markets, hedge funds, short term funding, and money markets won’t be collected without interruption or made available publicly in an accessible way. [Emphasis Added]\n\nTo summarize, there are various legal, information technology and manpower reasons to think that the claims of the Republican Senate Banking Committee members that another part of the Treasury will take on this work without disruption is not credible. It's also important to emphasize that a key reason the Office of Financial Research is such an effective organization is that it is not a financial regulator. This means that agencies aren’t as averse to sharing their data with it, in a way they would be with other financial regulators. This issue applies to an even greater degree to private actors who took years to become comfortable sharing data with the Office of Financial Research, assured that that data would not be used for supervisory purposes by a regulator. This issue is especially important if the Treasury as a whole doesn’t inherit the OFR’s ability to require data reporting, and has to undertake a volunteer survey.\n\nThe Financial Stability Oversight Council is the Office of Financial Research’s main “client” within the Federal Government. Their data collection and publishing efforts are the main thing which distinguishes FSOC activities from a simple excuse for financial regulators to get together and meet in a fancy room. It's also important to emphasize that since the Treasury secretary is the one who “proposes” the FSOC’s budget, Secretary Bessent could also permanently defund FSOC. In the most extreme scenario, his next three proposed budgets could be 0 dollars—which would mean that even a hypothetical future Democratic administration could not refund the council without new congressional legislation. At the very least, he could propose budgets that reduce the FSOC to a skeleton staff, like Secretary Mnuchin did during the first Trump administration. The difference this time would be that a Democratic Treasury Secretary would be prevented by law from rebuilding the Financial Stability Oversight Council.\n\nNellie Liang, Brookings senior fellow and most recently under secretary for domestic finance at the U.S. Treasury Department in the Biden administration, told me over the weekend that:\n\nGiven the importance of market-based intermediation and that it often draws collectively on banks, securities firms, private funds, and insurers to provide credit to households and businesses, it is critical to have FSOC to improve communication and coordination across the different regulators since no individual regulator will have the visibility or ability to ensure that systemic financial risks are not building [emphasis added]\n\nEven if Treasury Secretary Bessent doesn’t gut the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s budget itself, its work will be greatly weakened if it doesn’t have OFR to support it.\n\nLet's take a step back for a moment. That was an enormous amount of detail, and I’m sure most readers are overwhelmed. The reason this issue is so important is that the Office of Financial Research provides both the federal government and Wall Street with key information about the evolution of the financial system and daily data about the state of the repo market, and short term funding markets in general (it’s worth revisiting the last interview Paul Krugman did with me on these topics). In such erratic times, having less data in a less timely manner on the various markets that have the potential to meltdown when volatility spikes too much could be the difference between a stressed but resilient financial system and a full blown financial crisis.\n\nWhich brings me to a major Office of Financial Research project that has been more than a decade in the making. In the 2008 Global Financial Crisis one factor which was seen to exacerbate the crisis was that financial derivatives were so often agreements between two parties. That meant that not only did companies risk that their bet would “go wrong”: they also risked that their bet would “go right”, but their counterparty couldn’t pay. Thus, a major part of the Dodd-Frank legislation was to try to mandate the use of central clearinghouses for derivative contracts. That way, the only counterparty uncertainty that mattered was with the clearinghouse itself. (For the basics of clearinghouses, check out this “Monetary Policy 101” piece from 2020)\n\nWhat Dodd-Frank didn’t do was mandate central clearing in government securities and repurchase agreement markets. Remember that we said some data was collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York? That data was from the “Bank of New York Mellon” (“BNY”), one of the main government securities clearinghouses. The other data that goes into the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) comes from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, another absolutely crucial clearing bank, and is collected by the Office of Financial Research. Having OFR collect data for this series was an intentional choice to prepare for the entrance of other clearing banks into these businesses, and data collection would need to reach those new clearinghouses to enter SOFR. In any case, a major part of the market had been missed by not collecting data in the dark underworld of repurchase agreements that are not centrally cleared.\n\nSo it was intuitive for the Office of Financial Research to step into the breach. After multiple data collection pilots OFR began the process of making this a permanent dataset, with mandatory reporting by various financial institutions, over the last few years. The final rule requiring institutions to report this data only came into effect July 5th 2024, while the data collection itself only began in December. More entities are required to report starting July 1st, just a few weeks from now. This data, known by the ugly acronym “NCCBR” or “Non-Centrally Cleared Bilateral Repo”, has already provided a great deal of insight. Biden Treasury Under secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang told me, in relation to this topic, that:\n\nTreasury repo markets are the anchor of US funding markets and financial market liquidity, and SOFR provides market-sensitive information each day on the cost and conditions in that market. We should not be dismantling repo data collections at this time, when Treasury market debt is growing rapidly and concerns about market liquidity are increasing.  Instead, we need to continue to improve Treasury repo data, including adding the new data from OFR on uncleared bilateral repo, which has been a key source of fire sale risks in recent years. [emphasis added]\n\nLike other quotes from former government officials I’ve published in Notes on the Crises, this statement may seem subdued. But for an on the record quote from a very senior recent United States Treasury Official, this is quite alarming language. \n\nFormer Deputy Director of the Office of Financial Research Stacey Schreft also had much to say about this, having spent so much time and energy on collecting and understanding this data:\n\nVisibility into the huge NCCBR segment of the repo market matters for two reasons in particular. First, NCCBR activity can affect liquidity in Treasury markets and money markets. The OFR has a pulse on this through its NCCBR data collection. In the global financial crisis of 2008-09, disruptions in the repo market played a pivotal role, spreading stress across the financial system more widely. The NCCBR market segment is also proving to be much larger than expected, accounting for more than 40% of all repos. Should the collection of these data vanish, or be disrupted, forces like those observed in the 2008-09 crisis could build without the public or the government being aware of them. [Emphasis added]\n\nThis is already bad enough, but as we’ve discussed previously, the institutions that are likely to explode are hedge funds. The Office of Financial Research has also collated and harmonized data on hedge funds from across the federal government, providing greater insight into their leverage and vulnerabilities in what it calls its “hedge fund monitor”. Losing OFR thus costs insight and understanding from a key area of our financial system from multiple directions\n\nThe last I heard from congressional sources, defunding the Office of Financial Research was still on track to happen, as long as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act itself passes. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s office gave me this quote from Elizabeth Warren in response to my request for comment:\n\nAt a moment when most American families are worried about a potential recession, President Trump and Congressional Republicans are trying to eliminate the Office of Financial Research and destroy the Financial Stability Oversight Council with their “Big, Beautiful Bill.” These offices were created after the 2008 financial crisis to identify financial sector risks that could set off the next major financial crash, and their destruction at the hands of Republicans would leave millions of American families vulnerable to the next crisis.\n\nI think Elizabeth Warren’s assessment of the situation is both fair and accurate. \n\nDemocrats on the Senate Banking committee are looking to make their case to the senate “Parliamentarian”, the infamous interpreter of Senate rules and procedure. Their case centers around the “Byrd rule” which was aimed to stop so-called “abuse” of the legislative budgetary process to insert “non-budgetary” items that would not get past a filibuster. The senate procedure experts I’ve talked to are skeptical that this will succeed; And, in any case, Senate majority leadership can just… ignore the Parliamentarian. Thus, it will take a surprise outcry from both the public, or Wall Street, to derail killing this obscure little agency that is doing such important work.\n\nWhich brings me to my final point. Last Thursday the Financial Stability Oversight Council released its March 20th 2025 minutes, its first meeting minutes of the second Trump administration. The minutes have many interesting details, but their summation of what Treasury secretary Bessent said about FSOC is especially interesting:\n\nThe Chairperson said in conclusion that history indicates that markets will not always be calm, and this Council would likely face financial stress at some point. He said that this Council can be a critical forum for helping to evaluate the different vulnerabilities facing the financial system, so that whatever shock materializes, members have a better collective understanding of how it may impact the broader financial system. He said that this approach would also help the Council to be ready to address shocks that arise. He noted that markets and institutions are interconnected, and he said that many financial issues implicate the authorities of multiple agencies. He noted that collaboration and coordination are critical and that the Council is important.\n\nDoes Bessent still think the Council is “important”? Does he support or oppose the Funding of the Office of Financial Research? As of this writing, a Treasury spokesperson had not provided a response to my questions. Bessent, other regulators (including Fed Chairman Jay Powell) and Wall Street executives should be asked if they support, oppose or are neutral on the defunding of the Office of Financial Research, the threat to the Financial Stability Oversight Council—and the risks this attack poses for the stability of the Treasury market, as well as the overall financial system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","html":"<p>Early last week I started working on a piece on why the Federal Reserve didn’t step in during the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>Trump Tariff Financial Panic</u></a>. The basic idea of that piece is simply that “repo rates”- the interest rate at which you can, in essence, borrow funds with treasury securities as collateral- didn’t move outside of the Federal Reserve’s target range. In the language of Wall Street, the Federal Reserve didn’t step in <strong>because the “money market” didn’t meltdown.</strong> The Federal Reserve, as well as market participants themselves, knew the money market didn’t meltdown.

Yet, under the surface, this data is less “New York Fed” than it seems. The FRBNY only collects one segment of the data. The rest <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/sofr?ref=crisesnotes.com#:~:text=The%20SOFR%20is%20calculated%20as,ET.\"><u>comes from the Office of Financial Research</u></a>, an entity within the United States Treasury created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform bill.&nbsp;</p><p>Which brings me to the main subject of this piece. On Wednesday, the Financial Times Alphaville blog did a piece entitled <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7962a211-a663-4ec0-99ed-1bde012bb0d8?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“Could Trump’s ‘big beautiful bill’ kill the OFR and accidentally sabotage SOFR?”</u></a> This possibility was very alarming, so Thursday I put aside the other things I’ve been working on and devoted myself full time to talking to numerous sources about this important issue. There are many extremely important and concerning things going on during this still-ongoing constitutional crisis. However, the combination of the obscurity of this issue, its far-reaching importance, and <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>the rare combination of financial, macroeconomic and legal knowledge needed to report</u></a> on its various aspects adequately demanded detailed <strong><em>Notes on the Crises</em></strong> coverage.</p><p>To start then, let’s focus on Dodd-Frank. Specifically, the unique method by which the Office of Financial Research is funded. In an attempt to avoid being subject to annual appropriations—<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/revealed-the-seven-secret-federal-reserve-books-i-won-through-foia/\"><u>a perpetual concern here at <em>Notes on the Crises</em></u></a>—Dodd-Frank created a fee (referred to as an “assessment”) on the largest banks (known as “Systemically Important Financial Institutions”) as <a href=\"https://www.financialresearch.gov/budget/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>well as any banks with 250 billion dollars</u></a>, or more, in assets. Collecting this leads to a positive balance in the “Financial Research Fund”. This “fund”, in turn, authorizes expenditures by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Office of Financial Research. To put things more precisely: the secretary of the Treasury (who is chairman of FSOC) proposes an FSOC budget each year. Then, if ratified by a majority of Financial Stability Oversight Council voting members, that becomes FSOC’s budget. The OFR director meanwhile determines OFR’s budget “in consultation” with the Treasury secretary (in practice they treat that “consultation” as a veto).&nbsp; Both budget processes lead to expenditures that “debit” the Financial Research Fund.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, we are back to the topic of <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/a-scam-built-atop-an-accounting-gimmick-wrapped-in-bullshit-why-visiting-fort-knox-is-not-about-selling-gold-but-is-about-buying-bitcoin/\"><u>accounting gimmicks</u></a>. The Federal Government has all sorts of accounting gimmicks to distinguish different types of spending, even if <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/musk-in-your-computers-paul-krugman-interviews-nathan-tankus/\"><u>payments ultimately flow out of the Bureau of Fiscal Service and the very same bank account</u></a>. The point of this accounting gimmick is to avoid annual congressional appropriations fights. That means that for accounting purposes, the expenditures “come out” of this fund, rather than the “general fund”. But it's all public money. To be clear, I do not call this an “accounting gimmick” pejoratively. I think <strong>insulating financial regulators from annual appropriations is a good thing.</strong> It's just that trying to do so through avoiding the <strong>politics</strong> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/just-another-administrative-agency-preserving-central-bank-discretion-without-illusions/\"><u>of government budgeting is self-defeating</u></a>.</p><p>Enter the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA if you have the stomach churning misfortune of having to work on congressional issues right now. As FT Alphaville first reported, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/hr1/BILLS-119hr1eh.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the house legislation</u></a> limits the “assessments” that can be levied. Specifically, it limits the assessments to a three year rolling average of the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s expenses. Excess sums that happen to be “in” the Financial Research Fund get “moved” to the general fund. Sweeping “money” from one “fund” to the general fund <strong>is an accounting gimmick, </strong>meant to limit the expenditures those “side funds” authorize. Thus, without ever <strong>even mentioning the Office of Financial Research</strong>, this provision implicitly moves its budget to zero. So much for avoiding annual congressional appropriations fights! Live by the accounting gimmick—die by it too.</p><p>FT Alphaville was unsure whether this was an intentional move or not. The Republican Majority on the Senate Banking Committee <a href=\"https://archive.ph/9xNab?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>released a press release Friday</u></a> confirming that they were intentionally eliminating the “duplicative Office of Financial Research (OFR)”. According to sources I’ve talked to in the Senate, Republican committee members have shown little concern with the elimination of the Office of Financial Research. They also seem aware of the concerns over SOFR, because both their <a href=\"https://archive.ph/lTt1M?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“one pager”</u></a> and <a href=\"https://archive.ph/5U4jV?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“section by section”</u></a> documents claim their proposals are preserving financing for SOFR. Yet, this “preservation” is not in their <a href=\"https://archive.ph/uWWAz?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>legislative text proposal</u></a>. Confusingly, the “section by section” document even claims, falsely, that their proposed legislative text “provides the Treasury Department with the necessary authority/funds to continue collecting data on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)”.</p><p>There are many reasons to doubt the Majority Senate Banking’s claims. For one thing, if they plan on replicating the OFR’s activities then the alleged budgetary savings would disappear. No one, <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61379?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>not least the Congressional Budget Office</u></a>, has estimated the cost of replicating OFR activities at “main Treasury”.

But for an on the record quote from a very senior recent United States Treasury Official,<strong> this is quite alarming language.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Former Deputy Director of the Office of Financial Research Stacey Schreft also had much to say about this, having spent so much time and energy on collecting and understanding this data:</p><blockquote>Visibility into the <strong>huge NCCBR segment of the repo market</strong> matters for two reasons in particular. First, NCCBR activity can affect liquidity in Treasury markets and money markets. The OFR has a pulse on this through its NCCBR data collection. In the global financial crisis of 2008-09, <strong>disruptions in the repo market played a pivotal role, spreading stress across the financial system</strong> more widely. The NCCBR market segment is also <strong>proving to be much larger than expected, accounting for more than 40% of all repos</strong>. Should the collection of these data vanish, or be disrupted, forces like those <strong>observed in the 2008-09 crisis could build without the public or the government being aware of them</strong>. [Emphasis added]</blockquote><p>This is already bad enough, but <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/liquidity-volatility-and-market-craziness-paul-krugman-interviews-nathan-tankus-again/\"><u>as we’ve discussed previously</u></a>, <strong>the institutions that are likely to explode are hedge funds.</strong> The Office of Financial Research <strong>has also</strong> collated and harmonized data on hedge funds from across the federal government, providing greater insight into their leverage and vulnerabilities in what it <a href=\"https://www.financialresearch.gov/hedge-fund-monitor/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>calls its “hedge fund monitor”</u></a>. Losing OFR thus costs insight and understanding from a key area of our financial system from multiple directions</p><p>The last I heard from congressional sources, defunding the Office of Financial Research was still on track to happen, as long as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act itself passes. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s office gave me this quote from Elizabeth Warren in response to my request for comment:</p><blockquote>At a moment when most American families are worried about a potential recession, President Trump and Congressional Republicans are trying to eliminate the Office of Financial Research and destroy the Financial Stability Oversight Council with their “Big, Beautiful Bill.” These offices were created after the 2008 financial crisis to identify financial sector risks that could set off the next major financial crash, and their destruction at the hands of Republicans would leave millions of American families vulnerable to the next crisis.</blockquote><p>I think Elizabeth Warren’s assessment of the situation is both fair and accurate.&nbsp;</p><p>Democrats on the Senate Banking committee are looking to make their case to the senate “Parliamentarian”, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentarian_of_the_United_States_Senate?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>infamous interpreter of Senate rules and procedure</u></a>. Their case centers around the “Byrd rule” which was aimed to stop so-called “abuse” of the legislative budgetary process to insert “non-budgetary” items that would not get past a filibuster. The senate procedure experts I’ve talked to are skeptical that this will succeed; And, in any case, Senate majority leadership can just… ignore the Parliamentarian. Thus, it will take a surprise outcry from both the public, or Wall Street, to derail killing this obscure little agency that is doing such important work.</p><p>Which brings me to my final point. Last Thursday the Financial Stability Oversight Council released <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC_20250320_Minutes.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>its March 20th 2025 minutes</u></a>, its first meeting minutes of the second Trump administration. The minutes have many interesting details, but their summation of what Treasury secretary Bessent said about <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC_20250320_Minutes.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>FSOC is especially interesting</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The Chairperson said in conclusion that history indicates that markets will not always be calm, and this Council would likely face financial stress at some point. He said that this Council can be a critical forum for helping to evaluate the different vulnerabilities facing the financial system, so that whatever shock materializes, <strong>members have a better collective understanding</strong> of how it may impact the broader financial system. He said that this approach would also help the Council to be ready to address shocks that arise. He noted that markets and institutions are interconnected, and he said that many financial issues implicate the authorities of multiple agencies. He noted that <strong>collaboration and coordination are critical and that the Council is important.</strong></blockquote><p>Does Bessent still think the Council is “important”? Does he support or oppose the Funding of the Office of Financial Research? As of this writing, a Treasury spokesperson had not provided a response to my questions. Bessent, other regulators (including Fed Chairman Jay Powell) and Wall Street executives should be asked if they support, oppose or are neutral on the defunding of the Office of Financial Research, the threat to the Financial Stability Oversight Council—and the risks this attack poses for the stability of the Treasury market, as well as the overall financial system.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-eliminates-the-office-of-financial-research/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"1c5550fa-b274-46d8-adf7-57ad5afd186f","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"68478f19496bc10001f18b9c","reading_time":13}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"April

seven weeks since the first interview Krugman did with me was published, I have another interview to bring readers. It's quite surreal to be something like a regular correspondent for Paul Krugman on what’s happening. Even more so because this interview is not particularly focused on, say, the Treasury’s internal payments system or the technicalities of the Automated Clearing House payments system. Instead it's focused on the bread and butter elements that make up a modern financial crisis. \n\nOne reason this is surreal for me is that I first got interested in economics when, in January 2009, I took a class called “Show Me the Money” at Urban Academy Laboratory High School that was all about the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 that had just happened. Krugman’s articles were a regular feature in that class. I don’t think I could have imagined then that sixteen years later Paul Krugman would be regularly inviting me onto his “show” to explain what’s going on- including with a burgeoning financial crisis. Life truly takes you to strange places.\n\nSpeaking of strange surreal experiences, it's time to tell readers other exciting news: I’ve signed a lease for a Notes on the Crises office in Manhattan! It is unbelievable that the generous support of readers has gotten me to this point, but it has. My vision for this office- in its entire 2000 square feet glory- will be explained in detail in the coming weeks and months. For now I’ll just say that this office will allow me to greatly expand my activities and facilitate creating a community of interested experts, researchers, freelancers, and volunteers- and with enough funding and support, perhaps even employees…- to do more reporting on a greater number of topics. It also facilitates me building a professional audio/video set up so that Notes on the Crises does not simply live in the written word. Furnishing the office is moving quickly and the office should be functional, and open to interested parties, by the end of next week. For security reasons I am keeping the location of the office confidential- events with subscribers will happen elsewhere.\n\nFinally, I’d like to end with what I said in the introduction of the previous Krugman interview:\n\nIf you want to take on Krugman’s concern about what happens “if you get hit by a truck” and my answer “If someone out there who's watching this or reading the transcript wants to put up a budget, $500,000 or a million to train up people and, you know, make me replaceable, I'm more than eager to train up my redundancies.”  You are more than welcome to email me at Crisesnotes@gmail.com or contact me on signal at NathanTankus.01\n\nYoutube video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfymwafbYrk\n\n\n\nPaul Krugman’s Introduction:\n\nNathan Tankus has become an essential resource during these strange and scary times. My last chat with Nathan was about DOGE’s depredations at government agencies. This time I spoke with him about disruptions in financial markets.\n\nI continue to be astonished at how important the “plumbing” of these markets — the stuff that makes them function, which we normally don’t even notice — becomes when everything falls apart. And economists in general don’t know that much about the plumbing, so we need help from people like Nathan who do.\n\nOne thing that struck me during the conversation was Nathan’s explanation of the partial easing of financial stress after the crazy tariffs announced April 2 were replaced by the equally crazy tariffs of April 9. He points out that while a serious analysis of the April 9 tariffs showed that they were as bad in their own way as the original tariffs, the narrative was that policy had eased. And markets, he insists (and I agree) are less information processors than conventional wisdom processors.\n\nMuch more in the interview. Transcript below.\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT: \n\n[recorded 4/16/25]\n\nPaul Krugman: So hi. Paul Krugman again.\n\nI'm doing a second session with Nathan Tankus, who is everywhere these days.\n\nHe's really in the middle of it. And last time we spoke it was really about DOGE which has by no means gone away as an issue but we're also having crazy action in the financial markets, which is in some ways, Nathan, where you came into this whole discussion. I want to try and actually figure it out myself, but also walk listeners through what's going on.\n\nSo welcome. I guess this is my show these days.\n\nYou were actually warning about a potential financial crisis before the whole post Rose Garden stuff. You want to tell us about what you were thinking and we can go from there?\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah. So, I've been calling this series since it started January 31st, the “Trump-Musk payments crisis.” And so this is a lot of what we talked about last time, All of the different ways that this system could blow up. We really emphasized that what the DOGE people are messing with at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service is literally the ability to make treasury payments. And in fact, what they're doing is so catastrophic that making treasury payments is kind of the least of the concerns. That'll be the most immediate thing, but like, you know, not getting money in the hospitals, not being able to collect taxes… \n\nIt’s hard to wrap your mind around this because it's so big, it’s kind of beyond a fiscal heart attack. Just, like, making the fiscal machinery of government completely break down. And they\n\nclearly have not really understood that they've been messing with that.\n\nAnd then an added layer, which I started covering around mid-March and had been investigating for a few weeks is that they took $80 million from New York City  or they debited New York City's account for $80 million. That kind of might sound complicated, but it's just like any time that you make a credit card payment, you're authorizing your credit card company to debit your account, so you make the payment. All sorts of other debits or credits are authorized by all sorts of actors, but sometimes these debits aren't authorized. Sometimes they're just done without warning.\n\nAnd normally what happens is, if you do that kind of thing, it's considered fraud and you get frozen out of the payment system if you do it too much. But in this case, because it's the federal government, there's no actor to freeze the federal government out of the payment system once there's a question.\n\nIn some fundamental sense, the whole concept of money is making a payment, and then that payment is done. That debt is canceled. You've figured it out. Maybe there's some legal dispute that comes up, and they decide to sue you after. But that's a whole new legal environment. There's no taking it back without going through any legal process unless you're the federal government. And from all the experts I've talked to and some anonymous sources, it seems like  there's no guardrail on their ability to just take money out of anyone's account.\n\nThat's messing fundamentally with the concept of money. When money is physical cash and I can hand you some dollar bills and then you can walk away, the idea that the payment is final is kind of easier. I have to go track you down, chase you down, have a court case to find you and send some people out there. But with accounts, there's always that awkward question of, can I just take the money back in your account? And we have all sorts of legal and operational niceties that makes that concept go further and further from your mind.\n\nObviously, there are people who experience these kinds of things already: immigrants before the recent crisis, sex workers, you know, there are all sorts of people at the margins of the\n\nfinancial system who know about how kind of shaky payment finality can be, but it's not a\n\ngeneralized thing in the whole society. It's not, for example, taking money out of New York City's bank account.\n\nAnd so, connecting it back to the financial crisis is, if you start recognizing that the United States government is undermining the concept that a payment is a payment is a payment and that there's payment finality and that you have the idea that at any moment your bank account can be frozen, debited, anything else, and that you can't really trust having money in the bank,\n\neven if it's to deposit insured because the Trump administration is taking the prerogative that they can just take anything from you. If financial markets took this seriously, this would already be like a burgeoning financial crisis.\n\nPaul Krugman: In some ways, I feel like we should be spending all our time on that. But on top of that, we have what looks to me to be a pretty big market dislocation. Nevermind the stock market though I think we both agree that that's not the right barometer but we're looking at bond markets, currency markets and while stuff has been happening and I thought I was ready after 2008 for weird stuff to happen in markets, but now we're getting a whole new level of weird and I've been reading you to try and understand.\n\nSo maybe first, just your initial take on what's been happening since Trump held up\n\nhis piece of cardboard in the Rose Garden.\n\nNathan Tankus: So we could talk about all sorts of complicated details. And of course, I've written literally 16,000 words on all the complicated details since last week. But in the big picture, the details are just to solidify the basic above the fold take, which is:  this is an extraordinary financial crisis because it is a financial crisis, more than any other financial crisis ever, that is directly connected to the erratic and bizarre and dangerous behavior of one person.\n\nAnd it's not simply the things that he's doing, but the sort of erratic moment to moment\n\ndecision making. In certain ways, if Trump just committed to causing a depression, if he just committed like, “we're gonna do these tariffs,” and he could credibly commit, to “we're going to cause a depression,” it would, of course, have all sorts of knock-on effects, but we wouldn't have had the financial crisis that we essentially had that, despite a lull, I think we're still in the middle of, because the financial crisis was specifically about the erratic-ness of his decisions.\n\nFor younger people on the internet, there's a kind of joke, like, “it's so over. We're so back.”\n\n“It's so over. We're so back,” which is just the idea where something bad happens and then you're like, “everything's done.” And then something good happens. You're like, “we're so back.\n\nEverything's great.” You know, “we're on top of the world.” And essentially the stock market has been behaving on a “it's so over, we're so back” mindset of just, “Trump is going to crash everything. No wait, the business people are in charge and actually things are going to be okay.”\n\nAnd they have been trading on that news in this frantic way, moment to moment, where even like a fake headline about Trump backing off on tariffs can, within 15 minutes. create and then take back $2.5 trillion of value on the stock market. And so that's the top line thing: this is a crisis of just Trump's erraticness and Wall Street perceives Trump as somewhat less erratic this week. So the volatility has gone down and so it's not such a crisis. So, if you can believe that Trump will stop, will not be so erratic in the future, then you might be able to believe that this financial crisis is over.\n\nPaul Krugman: And by the way, that’s not just financial, it's real. I mean, real investments, plant and equipment investments and so on. Who can make those investments when they have no idea what policy will be a week from now? But the mechanics. Normally you would expect tariffs to strengthen the dollar. Instead it's weakened. Normally we see interest rates go up, but it's been really weird. It's a spike in interest rates. Interest rates should strengthen the dollar, but it's weakened. And then there are lots of individual markets where spreads have widened a lot.\n\nWhat I learned from you is that the picture we all kind of have of this kind of smoothly\n\nfunctioning financial system is really wrong. You wrote about it, and maybe I should let you talk and try to explain, then I'll see if I can add or just reveal my confusion about all of that.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah. So the way I would put it is: Trump's erratic and bizarre behavior has kind of intersected with a set of longstanding financial regulatory and macro financial issues that a lot of experts have been talking about, at least aspects of, for the last decade. You know, a kind of conversation that was burgeoning in the circles that I run in.\n\nSo to back up, we had a great financial crisis in 2007-2008, largely associated with how the banks failed, they didn't have enough capital, and then also there were these sets of liquidity issues.\n\nAnd so there's a committee called the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is an\n\ninformal committee, but has developed a lot of informal power, which is basically a meeting of a bunch of financial regulators. The United States, Japan, Europe, coming together to come up with ways to reorganize the financial system. And they've done this a few different times. There was a time in the 80s called Basel I. There was a time in, like, the late 90s, early 2000s called Basel II. And then post financial crisis, we got Basel III.\n\nThe big thing about Basel II that a lot of people hammered on was: Basel II tried to focus things on risk-weighted capital requirements. So that's a way of talking about, okay, certain assets are a lot less risky than others, so maybe you shouldn't have to have as much net worth devoted to protecting yourself from losses for safer assets.\n\nPaul Krugman: For listeners, traditional banks take deposits, lend out the money, but we want\n\na bank to have some of its own money at stake, partly as a cushion so that if it takes losses on its lending, it can come out of the bank's capital, partly so that the bank has some skin in the game so that it doesn't take on due risks. And Basel II tried to say, the amount of capital should depend on how risky are the assets you're buying in. And they came up with a scheme for that. So that's really what you're describing.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah. So, to kind of roll that out a little bit, if a bank just got a rubber stamped bank license, like, “Hey, you want a bank license? Let's get you a bank license.” And you suddenly had the ability to create money and access the Fed, you make a bunch of loans and then you have assets and you have deposits. And the issue is: if you take any loss whatsoever, then your net worth, your equity (basically just assets minus liabilities) is negative. And for various reasons, this idea of easily getting a bank license only to have your net worth go negative, is not something that financial regulators have ever wanted to incentivize.\n\nSo what they do is, they say to someone who's proposing a business plan for a bank, “hey,\n\nyou need to have some starting out net worth so we know as you're getting going and you're making mistakes and you take some losses, that your net worth is not going to just be negative and that you're not, essentially, just getting to piggyback on the public dime, and so you don’t have the ability to just, like, change the world by making loans without anything on your end. So what you do is, you find “investors.” You sell them stock. They get this stock and say, “this is a nice stock.” And then they pay you money and that money becomes money in your account at the Federal Reserve. Then, on an accounting basis, you're starting out with your assets worth a lot more than your liabilities. And that's great.\n\nAnd so as you start making loans and so on, then you have that cushion of net worth to take losses. And for kind of obvious reasons, you want to make sure that people don't make so many loans and so many risky loans that they collapse, but they're still able to make a certain amount of loans.\n\nA lot of people showed up and said, “well, it should depend on the riskiness.” For example, owning a treasury bill, at least traditionally, forgetting everything that's happened in the last year or the last four months, is a lot safer than making a loan to a local real estate developer. And so why should you have to have the protection of a bunch of net worth against the treasury security the same way as you would for the loan? And so that makes sense a little bit, but the problem is in the details.\n\nThe problem is, okay, what is actual risk? How do you measure risk? How do you come up with that? And it's a lot harder and it's a lot easier to game than it seems on the surface. And in particular, what Basel II said was, “We're gonna trust the bank's internal models of risk. And as long as their internal models of risk say it's okay, then it's okay.”\n\nAnd I don't think it takes very much intellectual effort to think of all the ways that that\n\ncould blow up. And there are all sorts of details about how that got messed with and how that was manipulated to let the banks take on extraordinary amounts of risk without seeming like\n\nthose risks were there. That's a whole thing on the 2007, 2008 financial crisis. Whole books have been written about that topic.\n\nBut for today’s purposes, what's important is, Basel III showed up and said, “Okay, we went a little too crazy with the risk weighting. We need to just have a sort of backstop. We need to have, especially for the largest banks, a supplementary leverage requirement. So we'll have risk weighted, but we'll make sure we'll sanity check by saying, ‘there's this size of your balance sheet relative to your net worth that you can't go beyond.’” And then at the same time, which we can get into a little bit more, there were all sorts of things that they did on the liquidity side. But that's the big picture. And we'll talk a little bit more about how this has led into the crisis.\n\nPaul Krugman: Yeah, so Basel III set kind of a floor on capital, right? And then we've been operating under that regime. And what did that do?\n\nNathan Tankus: So, these largest banks at a tactical level, at a corporate level, they're called “bank holding companies.” And what that means is, they're not just the nice little chartered bank that has an account at the Federal Reserve. They have all these other subsidiaries that engage in all sorts of different activities. These are really kind of colossal institutions. And traditionally, going way back to the ‘50s, ‘60s and such, there was a technical part of the Federal Reserve Act which reached into these companies and limited how much the bank part could support the non-bank parts.\n\nAnd there’s a really under-reported part of the 2007- 2008 financial crisis about this. Saule Omarova, who was Biden's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency nominee, who was a Cornell Law professor, now I believe at University of Pennsylvania, has a really great paper from 2011 that's all about this issue.\n\nAnd one of the under-reported parts about the financial crisis is: as the banking system was starting to experience issues essentially about making payments, about being able to finance itself, especially on the putatively non-bank part of these bank holding companies, what they started to do was give waivers to these protections to let the bank part finance everything else, to essentially let finance leak out of the bank part to the non-bank parts. And that was their way of trying to keep things on the even keel. Of course, at a certain point it got too big for this kind of maneuver, but what that meant was that post financial crisis, it was like, “okay.” When things are hard with the largest banks, they're always just gonna let liquidity go wherever. They're not gonna keep to the original mechanism of trying to keep these things separate. If we're gonna deal with this, then we need to kind of assume that liquidity can go anywhere, that funds can go anywhere within a bank holding company. And so we need regulations on the whole bank holding company.\n\nAnd so these leverage requirements are on the whole bank holding company. And their\n\nliquidity requirements, these requirements of how many essentially “high quality liquid financial assets” they need to have. And we can talk about whether they're actually high quality liquid financial assets, but regardless, they have to hold these in case they need to make payments.\n\nBasically, what this did was, it made these balance sheets quite rigid. You know, on one hand, you have banks that have what are supposed to be liquid assets, that they're unwilling to use most of the time, even during stress times, because the regulations tell them they’ve got to hold onto these supposedly liquid assets. And at the same time, their balance sheets are kind of rigid now. They can't move up and down the way that they could before, especially for things that\n\nwere supposed to be low risk. And so this brings us to the treasury market. I don't know if you want to…\n\nPaul Krugman: So, alright. I think where we're going is that with the regulations, in some sense, it's fighting the last war issue.  The regulations were designed to limit the risk of a 2008 style crisis. And as I understand it, basically the restrictions on bank holding companies forced or led other institutions to step into the breach. Is that what really is happening?\n\nNathan Tankus: Exactly. And this kind of gets to the fundamental concept of liquidity.\n\nLiquidity is the idea that: I've got an asset and I can sell it or make a payment at a certain amount, accounted for value. The obvious example is a dollar bill. A dollar bill is a dollar and I can make a payment with the dollar. I can go to my bank and deposit a dollar in my account.\n\nThat's not perfect liquidity, but pretty darn good. And same thing with money in my checking account from the perspective of me as an individual.\n\nBut there are all sorts of assets out there. There are stocks, bonds, currencies. There are all sorts of assets, and trillions and trillions of dollars of assets. And by virtue of being assets, of being out there, someone has to own them. And if you own them, you have to hold them. And one of the under-commented strengths of the previous system was that balance sheets could expand and contract a lot as you need it, specifically around treasury bonds.\n\nSo, okay, however many billions of treasuries that are being auctioned, where people\n\nwant to sell more treasuries, there's a dealer. There's a government bond dealer that is in a bank holding company saying, “we'll make money if we expand our balance sheet and buy up some treasuries. So we'll do that. And hey people, there's a lot of demand for treasuries right now. Our balance sheet can shrink as we sell off these treasuries and we pay back our\n\nliabilities.”\n\nAnd this created a kind of flexibility, this ebb and flow where treasuries were liquid because there was a balance sheet that could always absorb them when they needed to be absorbed.\n\nSomeone's balance sheet could expand and take them on. And it didn't require a whole bunch of action from the Federal Reserve because the Federal Reserve could sort of just cultivate these larger conditions. And we didn't really notice that it was really the public backstopping all these things through all these powers that we've delegated.\n\nAnd the treasury market, it being the “most liquid market in the world” and being stable in that way, was related to these bank holding company dealers whose balance sheet could expand and contract.\n\nPaul Krugman: So I just have a clarifying question. The treasury is just US federal government debt. Are you using it to mean only the short-term treasury bills or are you including the longer maturities?\n\nNathan Tankus: I'm including all of it.\n\nPaul Krugman: But basically anybody who’d want to sell federal government debt could easily do that, which we took for granted, but was actually because there were these dealers who were basically in the bank holding companies who were the residual buyers who would always step in. But that was then.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah, exactly, exactly. They were the residual buyers. But we still had to deal with this risk problem. To have an absolute constraint on the whole balance sheet, the question became who's going to be the new buyer. And we should say big banks have talked about this.\n\nLike, let's exempt treasuries from leverage requirements. And there's a whole complicated set of debates for why regulators, why good governance types have not wanted to do that. And there's questions about whether it would fully deal with the issue and there's stuff with liquidity requirements.\n\nBut putting all that aside, fundamentally, whether or not there was an easy fix on the regulation side, you still need to have a residual buyer. And what has stepped in as the residual buyer has been hedge funds, these types of investors. They find high net worth institutions like pension funds and universities, and they sell them what are called limited partner shares. And basically they're able to go to town and make investments and say, “Hey, we'll get you a good return.” And what these entities have been doing in terms of, like, picking pennies off the ground, has expanded their balance sheet by buying treasuries, and they have been hedging themselves, essentially.\n\nSo there's a kind of product that institutions can buy that is supposedly safer, especially for those long end treasuries of 30 year, or 10 year terms. And so these funds have become the residual buyer.  They have stepped into the void created by a lack of monetary design by the\n\nfederal government. So something grew up to take on this role.\n\nPaul Krugman: Okay, so until a few months ago, if you were trying to sell US government debt, it would be very easy to do, you wouldn't be disturbing the price. But what many of us didn't realize was that actually it was a hedge fund that would step in and they would expect to be able to unload it but what made the assets easier to sell was the role of the hedge funds,\n\nwhich is a little alarming because people have always worried about hedge funds and whether they might be a systemic risk. And for most of my professional life, the answer was, “well, no, not really.” But now you're saying that they're in the middle of the system.\n\nNathan Tankus  Yeah, absolutely. And so people started becoming conscious of this around September 2019. There was a little hiccup, called repo madness, but then March 2020 comes around. In March 2020, the treasury market started to [experience] dysfunction. And it was that moment where people started recognizing this. The Federal Reserve, of course, stepped in and bought trillions of dollars of treasuries. At that time, I was pointing to the fact that we were covertly supporting the treasury market in these previous instances. We were covertly doing all these things.\n\nIt's a lot more obscure when the Federal Reserve issues a waiver to a technical regulation\n\nfrom the Federal Reserve Act no one's ever heard of in 2007 than when the Federal Reserve\n\nannounces in 2020 that it's going to be buying treasuries.\n\nPaul Krugman: So, March 2020, in case people have short memories, that's when COVID\n\nstarts.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yes, exactly. So COVID was a period of intense instability, dysfunction, and dysregulation. And in that moment, hedge funds started backing away and the treasury market started to dysfunction. We can talk about why hedge funds started backing away and the kind of problems there. But what I want to emphasize here is that when the Federal Reserve did that, people said,  “My God, the interventionist Federal Reserve is borrowing trillions of dollars in securities.”\n\nBut from my point of view, they were issuing waivers so that bank holding companies could provide whatever funds that the rest of the company needed. This was as interventionist an action from the Federal Reserve to support the Treasury market or support liquidity in these other markets as it would have been for the Federal Reserve to be buying it themselves. It's just that one way is kind of covert. It's sleepy. It's obscure. It's very difficult to understand. And one's kind of direct.\n\nThe story is, the Federal Reserve bought Treasury securities, so then they're more liquid because they bought them. It's a thing that people can kind of grasp from maybe a macroeconomics 101 class whereas the kind of sleepy regulation thing is more difficult. I read a whole law review article about it from Biden's OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] nominee and that's how I know about it.\n\nPaul Krugman: Alright.  So, in March 2020 there was a freeze up in the treasuries market and because the world had become wildly uncertain because of Covid, so the federal reserve stepped in and bought treasuries.  But there was a period there when they actually were hard to sell. And basically five years later, almost to the day, we get another seize up, this time\n\nnot because of a virus, but because of Donald Trump. And what you're saying is that basically hedge funds were not able to do their normal role. I think I know how that happens, but maybe you should spell that out a bit.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah. It's kind of funny to me because, you know, we were talking about Basel II and all that stuff about the risk weighted capital requirements. Well, we kind of have this bifurcated system where we solve the problems for the previous iteration of financial regulations. You know, we solve Basel II with Basel III for banks and for bank holding companies. Or we think we've solved it.\n\nBut then it's not like these kinds of risk management practices have gone away. I mean, they're not as bad as they used to be, but fundamentally, at the basic level, it's a lot of the same stuff.\n\nThe banks in 2005, in 2006, 2007 used value-at-risk models, which is a type of model of\n\ntrying to calculate risk from historical data, especially recent historical data, to see how risky, how volatile things are, to judge how risky what they're doing is. And so what happens when volatility goes up a lot, the value-at-risk model says, “there's a lot more risk out there.”\n\nAnd then, again, they have that conversation about capital, about financial net worth. You're only supposed to be taking on a certain amount of risk for a certain amount of net worth or a “certain amount of capital”. When the risk models blow out suddenly, you're taking on way too much risk for your amount of capital and the risk models are telling you, “you've got to deleverage, you've got to sell assets, pay back debts, shrink your balance sheet.”\n\nBut remember, the whole point, the reason that the hedge funds have become important in\n\nthe first place is that their balance sheets can expand when they need to expand. And so this is now creating the classic pro-cyclical situation. Liquidity is there when you don't really feel like you need it, and when you really feel like you need it, it's not there.\n\nLev Menand, law professor at Columbia, and his colleague Josh Younger, who used to be at the New York Federal Reserve, called them shadow dealers. Shadow dealers are kind of similar to shadow money in the sense that they're providing this treasury dealer role. They're in the market to buy and sell, but only when the times are good. Normal dealers are licensed by the Federal Reserve. They are supposed to always be there in the market. They're always supposed to be bidding on auctions and the privileges that they get are supposed to come with certain responsibilities, and of course hedge funds have none of those responsibilities. \n\nPaul Krugman: So, what's happened now is that you’ve got volatility. Nobody knows what tariffs are going to be in place three days from now. And that ends up weighing on hedge funds, which feel the need to contract. I guess I would throw in that when you mentioned picking up pennies, I'm old enough to remember long-term capital management, which was a gigantic hedge fund and people always said that their business model was vacuuming up pennies from under the couch cushions on a global scale, and it was great until it wasn't, and then suddenly blew up and markets froze in 1998 when that happened. And you're saying that actually what we're looking at now is something like that happening again except now it’s the market for US treasuries that actually is freezing up.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yes. But the same sort of things are happening in all sorts of different markets that, superficially, you might not see as directly related to the initial thing. For various complicated historical reasons over the last 15 years, a system has been built up where if things get too erratic, liquidity dries up in all these different parts of the system. And there's no balance sheet that is able or willing to absorb what's going on, unless of course it's the Federal Reserve or the Federal Government's balance sheet. \n\nBut there's no private sector balance sheet that's willing to absorb the\n\nassets that are on there. And where it comes back to Donald Trump. You have a system that works unless volatility goes above a certain level, Donald Trump is the perfect thing to give a heart attack to the system because he is volatility encapsulated.\n\nPaul Krugman: Okay, so it really is these highly leveraged actors out there who are really critical. You're saying it’s a market for treasuries and presumably a lot of other stuff as well. I mean, you're seeing spreads blow out on not just junk bonds, but sort of BAA corporate bonds, that sort of thing.\n\nSo the new climate of uncertainty basically forces the hedge funds—or high leverage\n\nactors, but I guess that's basically hedge funds—to contract and sell stuff. And so you get spiking interest rates even on heretofore the safest assets in the world. For some of us, the fall on the dollar, that's different from March 2020. At that time, the dollar actually went up because America was still the safe haven. So why is the dollar now falling in the middle of all of this?\n\nNathan Tankus: So, I think there's a few different things there. Before we get to exactly where the dollar is or why the dollar is falling in this situation, what I would emphasize is that liquidity is drying up everywhere.  When I say everywhere, I mean everywhere. \n\nLiquidity in, like, essentially currency trading. The foreign exchange market also kind of seized up last week. There was an article in risk.net that said liquidity in the foreign exchange spot market was worse than during COVID. Some of these same things happened in COVID, but this happened more. And the article says that relative to the period leading up to this, volatility within a day (financial market participants use the phrase “intraday” for that) but volatility went up more than five times.\n\nAnd so that volatility explosion is really the thing that's important in the foreign exchange market. Suddenly you really need to have big, big price movements where some entity with a balance sheet decides to step in and absorb some position or another.\n\nThis also connects up to the last 15 years. These things are called foreign exchange swaps.\n\nThere's the type of derivative where you swap one currency for another, you swap yen for dollars, and then it'll go back the other way. You'll swap it at a different price at some time down the line—a week, a month, three months, whatever. And these have become the kind of focal point of the financial system.\n\nAs of June 2024, there was $113 trillion worth of foreign exchange swaps out in the world, which is a mind-numbing number. The vast majority of that had dollars on one side. 87% of those swaps involved dollars, which is a truly astounding amount. Dollars are so important to this system that generally speaking, when a Japanese bank wants euros or a European bank or a British bank wants yen, they don't just swap. The obvious thing would be to swap yen for euros.\n\nInstead, they first swap yen for dollars and then swap dollars for euros. The dollar serves even as an intermediary between Japan and Europe, it's so central in these foreign exchange markets.\n\nPaul Krugman: Yeah. We call it the vehicle currency and it's what you take to get a ride from one currency to the other. But that role depends on dealers and the dealers need liquidity. \n\nWow. Okay.\n\nSo what you're saying is that all the foreign exchange markets, presumably corporate bond markets, treasuries, all of it depends upon liquidity supplied largely by hedge funds.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yes, in our current system. But also foreign hedge funds. It's not just that domestic hedge funds have pulled back. It's also that there are foreign hedge funds. And this is where these foreign exchange swaps come in. I wrote a piece a couple of years ago called The Utopian Vision of Financial Derivatives,  and what that piece was getting at is, if you're an ordinary person you might think lending to a New York real estate developer or lending to a regional Japanese government or lending to a British oil and gas company, that these are all different things.\n\nBut if you have a certain kind of lens, if you see the world through a certain set of rose-tinted glasses, all the financial market participant sees are different kinds of risks that can be mixed and matched. And I can turn any of those assets into a kind of treasury bill. I’ve just got to buy the right derivatives. So if I'm worried about them defaulting, then I can buy a credit default swap, which is just insurance against default. If I'm worried about the interest rates moving in a way that's bad for me, I'll buy an interest rate swap.\n\nAnd so you can sort of just construct any sort of asset you want. And this works as long as you don't have to worry about actually getting paid by the other person who has your derivative. And this of course was the big thing in the 2008 financial crisis.  The insurance giant AIG took one side of all of those credit default swap bets and then couldn't pay up. And then the federal government had to step in.\n\nBut even putting aside the counterparty stuff, there's also just this basic question of liquidity. My model says that when this certain event happens, the value of this asset will go down. But the model says the derivative should go up just enough to offset it. And so I haven't actually taken any loss. But the problem is, you don't actually know what's going to be happening in the\n\nliquidity, whether the model value will line up because of things that can be going on in the world. For example, liquidity drying up everywhere. And there's no such thing as a private sector liquidity swap. And of course, even if there were, the obvious question would be: who guarantees liquidity for the liquidity swap?\n\nAnd so ultimately, what happens is, there are all these investors who make decisions based on the idea that risks are just all swappable and they can get whatever kind of portfolio that they want with these products. And then it doesn't work in crisis times.\n\nPaul Krugman: Okay, and so we get this possibility that increased volatility means that the people who supply liquidity kind of go away, which means that all of these investments that were\n\nsupposed to be safe or at least limited risk because you had derivatives start to become\n\nreally problematic. So that's what you think is happening now to the markets.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah, when volatility goes down, it gets better. But volatility is elevated if you look at things like the VIX, which is an index everyone relies on. It has gone down some. So things are kind of a little bit calmer right now, but they're still quite elevated compared to what they were before all this started. With other financial crises, there's all sorts of financial indicators that you can look at to judge whether a crisis is gonna get more severe. The issue is, because everything is just related to volatility and the volatility in this situation is just related to Trump, there's no real financial expertise that can tell you exactly where this is going. It's like, you just need a psychologist. You need someone who's somehow an expert in Trump's mind palace or the people around Trump and how they can manipulate him (or not) to judge whether\n\nvolatility is going to explode next week or whether it'll settle down and he'll just, you know, flip channels and not get so focused on the news that week.\n\nPaul Krugman: Yeah. So what's strange is that it's not even so much the level of tariffs. It’s the fact that you don't know what they're going to be. We had one radical break in the tariff regime on April 2nd and then it zipped in a completely different direction on April 9th and then another big change on April 12th. And that's what's really the problem.\n\nNathan Tankus: And that's why I said the financial system would do a lot better if Trump just committed to creating a depression. Then you'd be like, “okay, he's going to raise tariffs a lot.\n\nHe's going to stick to it. It's going to cause a global recession. But we know it's going to cause a global recession.” The volatility now has been about trying to predict what will happen. And all the back and forth. And those huge swings between “the economy will be fine” vs. “a depression is coming” is what's interacting with these extant vulnerabilities in the financial system.\n\nPaul Krugman: I would say it's not clear you would be causing a depression if the policy\n\nwere stable. If we just had 25% tariffs. And everybody knew that was stable, then that would be a bad thing, but business would work with it. And it's not known whether they're 25% or 10% or 100%. That is the problem.\n\nAll right. In 2020, the Fed just stepped in and bought lots of treasuries. Is there a simple technical fix to this one? Why doesn't Jerome Powell just step in and rescue us from all of this?\n\nNathan Tankus: Well, there's a couple things.  We're talking about it kind of happening everywhere, and it kind of did happen everywhere in 2020, which is why there were all those other facilities around corporate debt, around municipalities and so on.\n\nPaul Krugman: So these were not just treasury bonds. I didn't even know that. I'm embarrassed, but they did a bunch of facilities for other markets as well, not just buying Treasuries?\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nPaul Krugman: Okay. So, sorry, go on.\n\nNathan Tankus: And so, they can step in on the liquidity issues. They're still worried about inflation and the tariffs are bringing up the question of inflation even more. So it’s kind of a full spectrum thing. They probably wouldn't do it unless things got really, really bad. But, I would expect,  if the treasury market had gotten too chaotic for them, I think they would have\n\nstepped in. And I think ultimately, even if there’s some awkwardness between some of the\n\nthings that they had said coming into this crisis, they would do that. And it would basically be fine.\n\nThe problem is, you know, in 2007, 2008, the volatility was about financial instability and recognizing the financial instability. So stepping in to stabilize financial markets could slow down or make the volatility go away. But, you know, Jerome Powell can't make the volatility of Donald Trump go away.\n\nAnd the Fed, for various reasons, both political but also kind of practical, wouldn't want to try to do a big audacious step in to deal with all the dysfunction related to Trump being unstable. I think if you ask them at a press conference, it would be like, “Well, it's the president's response.\n\nThe president is making a certain amount of decisions and he is pursuing a certain amount of economic policy and it's not our role to countermand him. And so if he wants to create a whole bunch of instability for his own reasons, that's essentially his business and we'll be concerned and we'll look at all the markets. But, you know, we hope there's a resolution to this and yada, yada, yada.”\n\nSo, doing a whole bunch of things probably wouldn't work that well and would also be stepping into the void or getting in the middle of this very charged political set of issues. As long as the Treasury can still make payments,  they can let Trump get to a certain point and see if there's kind of a resolution to this situation. The Fed doesn’t want to be involved with this at all, or as little as it can. They would prefer there to be a political resolution. \n\nAnd you kind of see similar things at a much lesser scale around the debt ceiling crises, where they've tried to really step out of the way and see it as a political issue to be resolved and only step in if they think something is irreversibly broken or if that seems like it is about to happen.\n\nPaul Krugman: Okay, I'm not sure if this is a devil's advocate argument or not,  but is there kind of a floor on how bad things can get? Because if the Fed steps in with facilities to address these kinds of balance sheets, and all the volatility contagion, if it's bad enough, they can always make sure that there is enough liquidity. They are essentially the buyer of last resort for a lot of assets.\n\nNathan Tankus: Let me think about that. I think to a certain extent that's true, but only for short bursts.  There's just a certain level of volatility where some of these non-bank financial institutions will blow up. I really think we were close to that Wednesday. I think if he had not backed off, if he had waited another day, we easily could have had a firm or multiple firms blow up and go down. And that's why I brought up Lehman Brothers in one of my posts.  I saw it as that serious and frankly, I was trying to be one of the voices to be, like, “Hey, this is a Lehman moment. So back off and, you know, try not to blow up a number of firms.”\n\nAnd I definitely think there is a level of volatility and a duration of volatility, like a set of days where, beyond that, we would see multiple firms blow up. And then there's also a question of international firms blowing up. And then of course, that brings up larger questions about the dollar. I think it'll be weeks, months, maybe even years before we fully understand just how close we came. And there's a lot of people who are keeping their cards very close to the vest because you don't want to say that your firm was, like, 24 hours from blowing up or whatever.\n\nBut I think we're going to learn more extraordinarily alarming things about last Tuesday, last Wednesday than is currently acknowledged. \n\nPaul Krugman: Just for time reference, April 2nd was the first big tariff announcement.\n\nAnd that was a Wednesday. Weeks ago. And then basically a week after that, we were pretty close to the edge of a of a post-Lehmann style financial crisis. And then Trump announced a different set of tariffs that were actually, overall, maybe just as high, but different anyway, and were perceived as a step back from the brink.\n\nAnd so you were saying that the financial system stepped back from the brink, but not that\n\nfar.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah. And volatility is still elevated. And this kind of goes back to the piece I put out the Tuesday before last, so I guess that's April 8th, which talked about the stock market. \n\nThese kinds of markets are conventional wisdom processors. That’s kind of a reference to Friedrich Hayek and the idea of markets as an information processor. It’s a little bit of the same thing but something different. The idea that they’re conventional wisdom processors is that there's a general idea among a certain rarefied group of people who are the most active participants in these markets and what is conventionally believed among them is really\n\nwhat drives things, not access to information that any group of people have. Or a consensus among a different group of people.\n\nThe stock market would change very differently if suddenly, a week from now, all the major\n\nstock traders were scientists. What they would price in, especially around things like climate change, would be very, very different from the current set of participants. So it's important.\n\nThe way people talk about markets is that there is an objective measure.  That they just take information from everywhere and process them. But really, it's a specific set of people.\n\nAs I say in that piece, you would have to have a specific mindset and be a specific person in the world to believe that Donald Trump would be better for the stock market than Joe Biden. To believe not only that Donald Trump would be good for the stock market, that he'd be so much better than having four years of Kamala Harris or whatever, that you can track the odds of\n\nTrump winning with the stock market going up when Trump's odds of winning were going up.\n\nLike that's a particular kind of worldview. You know, people that we don't particularly like, people that we think were kind of nuts might have said that. And of course, not everyone on Wall Street believed that, but enough people believed it on Wall Street that it was taken as a conventional wisdom.\n\nIt's not something that you should sort of fight against when you're trading stocks and\n\ntrading in other financial markets. And that's a uniquely dangerous situation because that kind of person is the kind of person who's going to look for any off ramp, any sort of little sign that things are going to be better. And so when the stock market went up a whole bunch after Trump's announcement and volatility pared back some, it's not so much that these are more protectionist tariffs, at least as of last Wednesday—Of course, it's changed even more in the week since then. It's not like they were great, but it was just a headline in the news that would make people say, “My God, Trump is backing off. Okay, good.”\n\nAnd what matters is not so much the reality of this thinking, but how different factors interact\n\nwith each other. And the media apparatuses present a general mood that comes from a certain perspective. It's so much that Trump needs to actually back off on tariffs or needs to be doing sane tariff policy, it just needs to be perceived as not crazy by these specific kind of idiosyncratic groups of people.\n\nPaul Krugman: Which does raise the question, if he really is going to be crazy, eventually that will filter through. So to some extent we may be getting a reprieve because the conventional wisdom is, it's really not so bad.  But just to say, it took about two hours for people in my circle who actually were doing the tariff numbers to see that these new tariffs are basically the same overall tariff. It’s the same average tariff rate as before.\n\nThey're different, but they're just as bad. The market treated it as a major step back from the cliff. And so that was all that mattered in the moment.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah.\n\nPaul Krugman: It may be motivated reasoning because of the politics, but I'm worried that there is another shoe to drop, that even now markets have not really processed just how unstable things are. Sounds like that's your sense. \n\nNathan Tankus: Yeah. It beggars belief that the tariff policy is not gonna pick up instability and that Trump is not gonna pick some crazy fight where you get into this back and forth between, “is he gonna do it? Is he not gonna do it? Is he gonna do it?” So I think that kind of episode is gonna happen.\n\nThe other thing is just what we started with, the main thing that I've been focusing on, what I've been calling the Trump-Musk payments crisis. The impoundment issues and just sort of taking seizure of the federal government. People used to talk about political risk being part of what gets priced in. Well, there's an enormous amount of political risk in the United States right now.\n\nAnd then there's the further point where they’re in the process of claiming that they can take money out of anyone's bank account or freeze anyone's bank account. It's actually mind-bending trying to keep up with these stories of all the different ways that they're going after bank accounts. I mean, they froze a New York state government bank account related to EPA grants that were already handed out that were being administered by Citibank. And I want to dig into that more and write about it more. But that's just one of, I would say, four or five different payment stories that are calamitous. \n\nLet alone their wanting to move social security off of COBOL, which we talked about. They want to do it within two to three months, and they want to use AI to do it. I mean, that is an existential threat to social security existing. That’s a cockamamie plan. And I don't know what the current state of it is. I've been focusing on the financial crisis, so I need to get back into it. But I don't even know how to articulate how insane a disaster this is. And hey, there's a lot of financial risk if social security breaks and no one's getting social security checks.\n\nAnd these kinds of risks are just like a dime a dozen right now, all across the\n\nadministrative state. And then there are other layers, forgetting even geopolitical things like,\n\nare we invading Greenland? Maybe? All of these things are just so enormous.\n\nThat's why, you know, I didn't think I would succeed, but why in that first week of the Trump-Musk payments crisis, I was pretty conscious in that Odd Lots interview on Bloomberg, to try to really hammer home just how potentially calamitous this is to the financial system and explicitly say that all these financial markets should be pricing in these kind of uncertainties and they are not doing so.\n\nThere are now questions that are burgeoning up on the dollar. I wrote a gigantic monster of a piece about that on Sunday. I'm going to be writing some more big picture things about the dollar this week, but to me, the real question of a disaster, of a crisis, is when these people who suddenly have started to lose faith in the Trump administration's economic policy, that they start looking around and looking for other eventualities. They look at other things that are threats to the dollar, and come across the panoply of things that I've been covering and put two and two together. If this payment system goes down, the whole fiscal machinery that makes the dollar the dollar is gonna collapse.  And then that could potentially be a second wave of the financial crisis.\n\nBut I don't know whether to put it as a bright side or a negative. And right now I'm kind of more inclined to see it as a negative but, even when something is kind of slammed in their face, like Trump's tariffs, they didn't really get the message until he had to slam their faces into the\n\npavement a few times.\n\nSomething like the Trump-Musk payments crisis, it's the kind of thing where, as Joe Weisenthal said at the end of that interview, financial markets will only freak out when something actually breaks. But we can't wait for something to break. That is too dangerous. That's too calamitous.\n\nThey'll show up and say, “man, this problem is so bad,” when the building's already burned\n\ndown and is in a cinder.\n\nPaul Krugman: Maybe we should leave it there. I need a drink.\n\nNathan Tankus: Well, let's get that drink.\n\nLast thing I wanted to mention, and this is also a sign of how bad the crisis is: My lease on an office in Manhattan started yesterday, 2,000 square feet. And so, for listeners who want to support that kind of effort, make sure that that venture is a success, kind of expanding notes on the crises into a bigger deal, you know, please take out a subscription, send a tip. Everything helps right now as I expand out my reporting and bring on some really amazing people to contribute to do some of the things that I've been doing on different topics.\n\nPaul Krugman: Okay, we're gonna need it. So good luck and hope that DOGE doesn't freeze your payment for the office space.\n\nOkay, thanks for coming on.\n\nNathan Tankus: Of course.\n\nPaul Krugman: I'm sure that you will have plenty of work to do, alas.\n\nNathan Tankus: Yes, unfortunately. I’ll have to go visit my office.\n\nPaul Krugman: Take care.\n\n","html":"<div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/support\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Tip!</a></div><p>Exactly seven weeks since the first interview Krugman did with me was published, I have <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/nathan-tankus-part-ii?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">another interview to bring readers</a>. It's quite surreal to be something like a regular correspondent for Paul Krugman on what’s happening. Even more so because this interview is not particularly focused on, say, the Treasury’s internal payments system or the technicalities of the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/can-the-trump-administration-arbitrarily-take-money-from-anyones-bank-account/\"><u>Automated Clearing House payments system</u></a>. Instead it's focused on the bread and butter elements that make up a modern financial crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>One reason this is surreal for me is that <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/musk-in-your-computers-paul-krugman-interviews-nathan-tankus/\"><u>I first got interested in economics</u></a> when, in January 2009, I took a class called “Show Me the Money” at <a href=\"https://www.friendsofurban.org/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Urban Academy Laboratory High School</u></a> that was all about the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 that had just happened. Krugman’s articles were a regular feature in that class. I don’t think I could have imagined then that sixteen years later Paul Krugman would be <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/nathan-tankus-part-ii?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">regularly inviting me onto his “show”</a> to explain what’s going on- including with a burgeoning financial crisis. Life truly takes you to strange places.</p><p>Speaking of strange surreal experiences, it's time to tell readers other exciting news: I’ve signed a lease for a Notes on the Crises office in Manhattan! It is unbelievable that the generous support of readers has gotten me to this point, but it has. My vision for this office- in its entire 2000 square feet glory- will be explained in detail in the coming weeks and months. For now I’ll just say that this office will allow me to greatly expand my activities and facilitate creating a community of interested experts, researchers, freelancers, and volunteers- and with enough funding and support, perhaps even employees…- to do more reporting on a greater number of topics. It also facilitates me building a professional audio/video set up so that Notes on the Crises does not simply live in the written word. Furnishing the office is moving quickly and the office should be functional, and open to interested parties, by the end of next week. For security reasons I am keeping the location of the office confidential- events with subscribers will happen elsewhere.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdQFQM_IoN6m2ucGBFxvjEP3jrZtJSO4-qDNqRTjLfib5VXQBBfWcCBwt1wmYn0TnLb5pImxx1s3ZO99wT5U1OSpjZKBeVv-PDSBIXmSYOpig-iJcC0E0p13M3TFDnO8x-2EcGn?key=Y6t9ZVrhgyudXS40X4KxmSDH\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"468\"></figure><p>Finally, I’d like to end with what I said in the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/musk-in-your-computers-paul-krugman-interviews-nathan-tankus/\"><u>previous Krugman interview:</u></a></p><blockquote><strong>If you want to take on Krugman’s concern</strong> about what happens<strong> “if you get hit by a truck”</strong> and my answer “If someone out there who's watching this or reading the transcript wants to put up a budget, $500,000 or a million to train up people and, you know, make me replaceable, I'm more than eager to train up my redundancies.”&nbsp; You are more than welcome to email me at <a href=\"mailto:Crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><u>Crisesnotes@gmail.com</u></a> or contact me on signal at NathanTankus.01</blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KfymwafbYrk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Liquidity, Volatility and Market Craziness: Paul Krugman Interviews Nathan Tankus Again\"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Youtube video here: </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfymwafbYrk&ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfymwafbYrk</strong></a><strong>  </strong></p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/musk-in-your-computers-an-interviewhttps://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/nathan-tankus-part-ii?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong><u>Paul Krugman’s Introduction:</u></strong></a></p><p>Nathan Tankus has become an essential resource during these strange and scary times.

Paul Krugman again.</p><p>I'm doing a second session with Nathan Tankus, who is everywhere these days.</p><p>He's really in the middle of it. And last time we spoke it was really about DOGE which has by no means gone away as an issue but we're also having crazy action in the financial markets, which is in some ways, Nathan, where you came into this whole discussion. I want to try and actually figure it out myself, but also walk listeners through what's going on.</p><p>So welcome. I guess this is my show these days.</p><p>You were actually warning about a potential financial crisis before the whole post Rose Garden stuff. You want to tell us about what you were thinking and we can go from there?</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yeah. So, I've been calling this series since it started January 31st, the “Trump-Musk payments crisis.” And so this is a lot of <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/musk-in-your-computers-an-interview?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>what we talked about last time</u></a>, All of the different ways that this system could blow up. We really emphasized that what the DOGE people are messing with at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service is literally the ability to make treasury payments. And in fact, what they're doing is so catastrophic that making treasury payments is kind of the least of the concerns. That'll be the most immediate thing, but like, you know, not getting money in the hospitals, not being able to collect taxes…&nbsp;</p><p>It’s hard to wrap your mind around this because it's so big, it’s kind of beyond a fiscal heart attack. Just, like, making the fiscal machinery of government completely break down. And they</p><p>clearly have not really understood that they've been messing with that.</p><p>And then an added layer, which <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/can-the-trump-administration-arbitrarily-take-money-from-anyones-bank-account/\"><u>I started covering around mid-March</u></a> and had been investigating for a few weeks is that they took $80 million from New York City&nbsp; or they debited New York City's account for $80 million. That kind of might sound complicated, but it's just like any time that you make a credit card payment, you're authorizing your credit card company to debit your account, so you make the payment. All sorts of other debits or credits are authorized by all sorts of actors, but sometimes these debits aren't authorized. Sometimes they're just done without warning.</p><p>And normally what happens is, if you do that kind of thing, it's considered fraud and you get frozen out of the payment system if you do it too much. But in this case, because it's the federal government, there's no actor to freeze the federal government out of the payment system once there's a question.</p><p>In some fundamental sense, the whole concept of money is making a payment, and then that payment is done. That debt is canceled. You've figured it out. Maybe there's some legal dispute that comes up, and they decide to sue you after. But that's a whole new legal environment. There's no taking it back without going through any legal process unless you're the federal government. And from all the experts I've talked to and some anonymous sources, it seems like&nbsp; there's no guardrail on their ability to just take money out of anyone's account.</p><p>That's messing fundamentally with the concept of money. When money is physical cash and I can hand you some dollar bills and then you can walk away, the idea that the payment is final is kind of easier. I have to go track you down, chase you down, have a court case to find you and send some people out there. But with accounts, there's always that awkward question of, can I just take the money back in your account? And we have all sorts of legal and operational niceties that makes that concept go further and further from your mind.</p><p>Obviously, there are people who experience these kinds of things already: immigrants before the recent crisis, sex workers, you know, there are all sorts of people at the margins of the</p><p>financial system who know about how kind of shaky payment finality can be, but it's not a</p><p>generalized thing in the whole society. It's not, for example, taking money out of New York City's bank account.</p><p>And so, connecting it back to the financial crisis is, if you start recognizing that the United States government is undermining the concept that a payment is a payment is a payment and that there's payment finality and that you have the idea that at any moment your bank account can be frozen, debited, anything else, and that you can't really trust having money in the bank,</p><p>even if it's to deposit insured because the Trump administration is taking the prerogative that they can just take anything from you. If financial markets took this seriously, this would already be like a burgeoning financial crisis.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>In some ways, I feel like we should be spending all our time on that. But on top of that, we have what looks to me to be a pretty big market dislocation. Nevermind the stock market though I think we both agree that that's not the right barometer but we're looking at bond markets, currency markets and while stuff has been happening and I thought I was ready after 2008 for weird stuff to happen in markets, but now we're getting a whole new level of weird and I've been reading you to try and understand.</p><p>So maybe first, just your initial take on what's been happening since Trump held up</p><p>his piece of cardboard in the Rose Garden.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> So we could talk about all sorts of complicated details. And of course,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/trumps-liberation-day-and-the-ongoing-stock-market-crash/\"><u> I've written</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>literally</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>16,000 words</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>on all the complicated details</u></a> since last week. But in the big picture, the details are just to solidify the basic above the fold take, which is:&nbsp; this is an extraordinary financial crisis because it is a financial crisis, more than any other financial crisis ever, that is directly connected to the erratic and bizarre and dangerous behavior of one person.</p><p>And it's not simply the things that he's doing, but the sort of erratic moment to moment</p><p>decision making. In certain ways, if Trump just committed to causing a depression, if he just committed like, “we're gonna do these tariffs,” and he could credibly commit, to “we're going to cause a depression,” it would, of course, have all sorts of knock-on effects, but we wouldn't have had the financial crisis that we essentially had that, despite a lull, I think we're still in the middle of, because the financial crisis was specifically about the erratic-ness of his decisions.</p><p>For younger people on the internet, there's a kind of joke, like, “it's so over. We're so back.”</p><p>“It's so over. We're so back,” which is just the idea where something bad happens and then you're like, “everything's done.” And then something good happens. You're like, “we're so back.</p><p>Everything's great.” You know, “we're on top of the world.” And essentially the stock market has been behaving on a “it's so over, we're so back” mindset of just, “Trump is going to crash everything. No wait, the business people are in charge and actually things are going to be okay.”</p><p>And they have been trading on that news in this frantic way, moment to moment, where even like a fake headline about Trump backing off on tariffs can, within 15 minutes. create and then take back $2.5 trillion of value on the stock market. And so that's the top line thing: this is a crisis of just Trump's erraticness and Wall Street perceives Trump as somewhat less erratic this week. So the volatility has gone down and so it's not such a crisis. So, if you can believe that Trump will stop, will not be so erratic in the future, then you might be able to believe that this financial crisis is over.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> And by the way, that’s not just financial, it's real. I mean, real investments, plant and equipment investments and so on. Who can make those investments when they have no idea what policy will be a week from now? But the mechanics. Normally you would expect tariffs to strengthen the dollar. Instead it's weakened. Normally we see interest rates go up, but it's been really weird. It's a spike in interest rates. Interest rates should strengthen the dollar, but it's weakened. And then there are lots of individual markets where spreads have widened a lot.</p><p>What I learned from you is that the picture we all kind of have of this kind of smoothly</p><p>functioning financial system is really wrong. <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>You wrote about it</u></a>, and maybe I should let you talk and try to explain, then I'll see if I can add or just reveal my confusion about all of that.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yeah. So the way I would put it is: Trump's erratic and bizarre behavior has kind of intersected with a set of longstanding financial regulatory and macro financial issues that a lot of experts have been talking about, at least aspects of, for the last decade. You know, a kind of conversation that was burgeoning in the circles that I run in.</p><p>So to back up, we had a great financial crisis in 2007-2008, largely associated with how the banks failed, they didn't have enough capital, and then also there were these sets of liquidity issues.</p><p>And so there's a committee called the <a href=\"https://files.crisesnotes.com/reviewofkeynesianeconomics.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Basel Committee on Banking Supervision</u></a>, which is an</p><p>informal committee, but has developed a lot of informal power, which is basically a meeting of a bunch of financial regulators. The United States, Japan, Europe, coming together to come up with ways to reorganize the financial system. And they've done this a few different times. There was a time in the 80s called Basel I. There was a time in, like, the late 90s, early 2000s called Basel II. And then post financial crisis, we got Basel III.</p><p>The big thing about Basel II that a lot of people hammered on was: Basel II tried to focus things on risk-weighted capital requirements. So that's a way of talking about, okay, certain assets are a lot less risky than others, so maybe you shouldn't have to have as much net worth devoted to protecting yourself from losses for safer assets.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> For listeners, traditional banks take deposits, lend out the money, but we want</p><p>a bank to have some of its own money at stake, partly as a cushion so that if it takes losses on its lending, it can come out of the bank's capital, partly so that the bank has some skin in the game so that it doesn't take on due risks. And Basel II tried to say, the amount of capital should depend on how risky are the assets you're buying in. And they came up with a scheme for that. So that's really what you're describing.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yeah. So, to kind of roll that out a little bit, if a bank <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-are-banks-special-monetary-policy/\"><u>just got a rubber stamped bank license</u></a>, like, “Hey, you want a bank license? Let's get you a bank license.” And you suddenly had the ability to create money and access the Fed, you make a bunch of loans and then you have assets and you have deposits. And the issue is: if you take any loss whatsoever, then your net worth, your equity (basically just assets minus liabilities) is negative. And for various reasons, this idea of easily getting a bank license <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-are-banks-special-monetary-policy/\"><u>only to have your net worth go negative</u></a>, is not something that financial regulators have ever wanted to incentivize.</p><p>So what they do is, they say to <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-are-banks-special-monetary-policy/\"><u>someone who's proposing a business plan for a bank</u></a>, “hey,</p><p>you need to have some starting out net worth so we know as you're getting going and you're making mistakes and you take some losses, that your net worth is not going to just be negative and that you're not, essentially, just getting to piggyback on the public dime, and so you don’t have the ability to just, like, change the world by making loans without anything on your end. So what you do is,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-are-banks-special-monetary-policy/\"><u> you find “investors.”</u></a> You sell them stock. They get this stock and say, “this is a nice stock.” And then they pay you money and that money becomes money in your account at the Federal Reserve. Then, on an accounting basis, you're starting out with your assets worth a lot more than your liabilities. And that's great.</p><p>And so as you start making loans and so on, then you have that <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-are-banks-special-monetary-policy/\"><u>cushion of net worth to take losses</u></a>. And for kind of obvious reasons, you want to make sure that people don't make so many loans and so many risky loans that they collapse, but they're still able to make a certain amount of loans.</p><p>A lot of people showed up and said, “well, it should depend on the riskiness.” For example, owning a treasury bill, at least traditionally, forgetting everything that's happened in the last year or the last four months, is a lot safer than making<a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> a loan to a local real estate developer</u></a>. And so why should you have to have the protection of a bunch of net worth against the treasury security the same way as you would for the loan? And so that makes sense a little bit, but the problem is in the details.</p><p>The problem is, okay, what is actual risk? How do you measure risk? How do you come up with that? And it's a lot harder and it's a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>lot easier to game than it seems on the surface</u></a>. And in particular, what Basel II said was, “We're gonna trust the bank's internal models of risk. And as long as their internal models of risk say it's okay, then it's okay.”</p><p>And I don't think it takes very much intellectual effort to think of all the ways that that</p><p>could blow up. And there are all sorts of details about how that got messed with and how that was manipulated to let the banks take on extraordinary amounts of risk without seeming like</p><p>those risks were there. That's a whole thing on the 2007, 2008 financial crisis. Whole books have been written about that topic.</p><p>But for today’s purposes, what's important is, Basel III showed up and said, “Okay, we went a little too crazy with the risk weighting. We need to just have a sort of backstop. We need to have, especially for the largest banks, a supplementary leverage requirement. So we'll have risk weighted, but we'll make sure we'll sanity check by saying, ‘there's this size of your balance sheet relative to your net worth that you can't go beyond.’” And then at the same time, which we can get into a little bit more, there were all sorts of things that they did on the liquidity side. But that's the big picture. And we'll talk a little bit more about how this has led into the crisis.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>Yeah, so Basel III set kind of a floor on capital, right? And then we've been operating under that regime. And what did that do?</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>So, these largest banks at a tactical level, at a corporate level, <a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>they're called “bank holding companies.</u></a>” And what that means is, they're not just the nice little chartered bank that has an account at the Federal Reserve. They have all these other subsidiaries that engage in all sorts of different activities. These are really kind of colossal institutions. And traditionally, going way back to the ‘50s, ‘60s and such, there was a technical part of the Federal Reserve Act which reached into these companies and limited how <a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>much the bank part could support the non-bank parts.</u></a></p><p>And there’s a really under-reported part of the 2007- 2008 financial crisis about this. <a href=\"https://www.law.upenn.edu/faculty/sto12?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Saule Omarova</u></a>, who was Biden's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency nominee, who was a Cornell Law professor, now I believe at University of Pennsylvania, has <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4513&context=nclr&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>a really great paper from 2011 that's all about this issue.</u></a></p><p>And one of the under-reported parts about the financial crisis is: as the banking system was starting to experience issues essentially about making payments, about being able to finance itself, especially on the putatively non-bank part of these bank holding companies, what they started to do was <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4513&context=nclr&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>give waivers to these protections to let the bank part finance</u></a> everything else, to essentially let finance leak out of the bank part to the non-bank parts. And that was their way of trying to<a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4513&context=nclr&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> keep things on the even keel</u></a>. Of course, at a certain point it got too big for this kind of maneuver, but what that meant was that post financial crisis, it was like, “okay.” When things are hard with the largest banks, they're always just gonna let liquidity go wherever. They're not gonna keep to the original mechanism of trying to keep these things separate. If we're gonna deal with this, then w<a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>e need to kind of assume that liquidity can go anywhere, that funds can go anywhere within a bank holding company</u></a>. And so we need regulations on the whole bank holding company.</p><p>And so these leverage requirements are on the whole bank holding company. And their</p><p>liquidity requirements, these requirements of how many essentially “high quality liquid financial assets” they need to have. And we can talk about whether they're actually high quality liquid financial assets, but regardless, they have to hold these in case they need to make payments.</p><p>Basically, what this did was, it made these balance sheets quite rigid. You know, on one hand, you have banks that have what <a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>are supposed to be liquid assets</u></a>, that they're unwilling to use most of the time, even during stress times, because the regulations tell them they’ve got to hold onto these supposedly liquid assets. And at the same time, their balance sheets are kind of rigid now. They can't move up and down the way that they could before, especially for things that</p><p>were supposed to be low risk. And so this brings us to the treasury market. I don't know if you want to…</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>So, alright. I think where we're going is that with the regulations, in some sense, it's fighting the last war issue.&nbsp; The regulations were designed to limit the risk of a 2008 style crisis. And as I understand it, basically the restrictions on bank holding companies forced or led other institutions to step into the breach. Is that what really is happening?</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> Exactly. And this kind of gets to the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>fundamental concept of liquidity.</u></a></p><p>Liquidity is the idea that: I've got an asset and I can sell it or make a payment at a certain amount, accounted for value. The obvious example is a dollar bill. A dollar bill is a dollar and I can make a payment with the dollar. I can go to my bank and deposit a dollar in my account.</p><p>That's not perfect liquidity, but pretty darn good. And same thing with money in my checking account from the perspective of me as an individual.</p><p>But there are all sorts of assets out there. There are stocks, bonds, currencies. There are all sorts of assets, and trillions and trillions of dollars of assets. And by virtue of being assets, of being out there, someone has to own them. And if you own them, you have to hold them. And one of the under-commented strengths of the previous system was that balance sheets could expand and contract a lot as you need it, specifically around treasury bonds.</p><p>So, okay, however many billions of treasuries that are being auctioned, where people</p><p>want to sell more treasuries, there's a dealer. There's a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>government bond dealer that is in a bank holding company</u></a> saying, “we'll make money if we expand our balance sheet and buy up some treasuries. So we'll do that. And hey people, there's a lot of demand for treasuries right now. Our balance sheet can shrink as we sell off these treasuries and we pay back our</p><p>liabilities.”</p><p>And this created a kind of flexibility,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u> this ebb and flow where treasuries were liquid because there was a balance sheet that could always absorb them</u></a> when they needed to be absorbed.</p><p>Someone's balance sheet could expand and take them on. And it didn't require a whole bunch of action from the Federal Reserve because the Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>could sort of just cultivate these larger conditions</u></a>. And we didn't really notice that it was really the public backstopping all these things through all these powers that we've delegated.</p><p>And the treasury market, it being the “most liquid market in the world” and being stable in that way, was related to<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u> these bank holding company dealers whose balance sheet could expand and contract.</u></a></p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> So I just have a clarifying question. The treasury is just US federal government debt. Are you using it to mean only the short-term treasury bills or are you including the longer maturities?</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>I'm including all of it.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> But basically anybody who’d want to sell federal government debt could easily do that, which we took for granted, but was actually because there were these dealers who were basically in the bank holding companies who were the residual buyers who would always step in. But that was then.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yeah, exactly, exactly. They <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>were the residual buyers</u></a>. But we still had to deal with this risk problem. To have an absolute constraint on the whole balance sheet, the question became who's going to be the new buyer. And we should say big banks have talked about this.</p><p>Like, let's exempt treasuries from leverage requirements. And there's a whole complicated set of <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/csfrayer.bsky.social/post/3lmkyayhiik2f?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>debates for why regulators, why good governance types have not wanted to do that</u></a>. And there's questions about whether it would fully deal with the issue and there's stuff with liquidity requirements.</p><p>But putting all that aside, fundamentally, whether or not there was an easy fix on the regulation side, you still need to have a residual buyer. And what has stepped in as the residual buyer has <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>been hedge funds, these types of investors</u></a>. They find high net worth institutions like pension funds and universities, and they sell them what are called limited partner shares. And basically they're able to go to town and make investments and say, “Hey, we'll get you a good return.” And what these entities have been doing in terms of, like, picking pennies off the ground, has expanded their balance sheet by buying treasuries, and they have been hedging themselves, essentially.</p><p>So there's a kind of product that institutions can buy that is supposedly safer, especially for those long end treasuries of 30 year, or 10 year terms. And so these funds <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>have become the residual buyer</u></a>.&nbsp; They have stepped into the void <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>created by a lack of monetary design</u></a> by the</p><p>federal government. So something grew up to take on this role.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> Okay, so until a few months ago, if you were trying to sell US government debt, it would be very easy to do, you wouldn't be disturbing the price. But what many of us didn't realize was that actually it was a hedge fund that would step in and they would expect to be able to unload it but what made the assets easier to sell was the role of the hedge funds,</p><p>which is a little alarming because people have always worried about hedge funds and whether they might be a systemic risk. And for most of my professional life, the answer was, “well, no, not really.” But now you're saying that they're in the middle of the system.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus</strong>&nbsp; Yeah, absolutely. And so people started becoming conscious of this around September 2019. There was a little hiccup, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/looking-back-at-repo-madness-one/\"><u>called repo madness</u></a>, but then March 2020 comes around. In <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>March 2020, the treasury market</u></a> started to [experience] dysfunction. And it was that moment where people started recognizing this. The Federal Reserve, of course, stepped in and bought <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>trillions of dollars of treasuries</u></a>. At that time, I was pointing to the fact that <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u>we were covertly supporting the treasury market in these previous instances</u></a>. We were covertly doing all these things.</p><p>It's a lot more obscure when the Federal Reserve issues a <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4513&context=nclr&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>waiver to a technical regulation</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4513&context=nclr&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>from the Federal Reserve Act no one's ever heard of in 2007</u></a> than when the Federal Reserve</p><p>announces in 2020 that it's going to be buying treasuries.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> So, March 2020, in case people have short memories, that's when COVID</p><p>starts.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yes, exactly. So COVID was a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>period of intense instability, dysfunction, and dysregulation</u></a>. And in that moment, hedge funds started backing away and the treasury market started to dysfunction. We can talk about why hedge funds started backing away and the kind of problems there. But what I want to emphasize here is that <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u>when the Federal Reserve did that, people said</u></a>,&nbsp; “My God, the interventionist Federal Reserve is borrowing trillions of dollars in securities.”</p><p>But <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u>from my point of view</u></a>, they were issuing waivers so that bank holding companies could provide whatever funds that the rest of the company needed. This was as interventionist an action from the Federal Reserve to support the Treasury market or support liquidity in these other markets as it would have been<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u> for the Federal Reserve to be buying it themselves</u></a>. It's just that one <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u>way is kind of covert</u></a>. It's sleepy. It's obscure. It's very difficult to understand. And <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u>one's kind of direct.</u></a></p><p>The story is, the Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-way-people-talk-about-the-federal/\"><u>bought Treasury securities</u></a>, so then they're more liquid because they bought them. It's a thing that people can kind of grasp from maybe a macroeconomics 101 class whereas the kind of sleepy regulation thing is more difficult. I read <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4513&context=nclr&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>a whole law review article</u></a> about it from <a href=\"https://www.law.upenn.edu/faculty/sto12?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Biden's OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] nominee</u></a> and that's how I know about it.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>Alright.&nbsp; So, in March 2020 there was a freeze up in the treasuries market and because the world had become wildly uncertain because of Covid, so the federal reserve stepped in and bought treasuries.&nbsp; But there was a period there when they actually were hard to sell. And basically five years later, almost to the day, we get another seize up, this time</p><p>not because of a virus, but because of Donald Trump. And what you're saying is that basically hedge funds were not able to do their normal role. I think I know how that happens, but maybe you should spell that out a bit.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yeah. It's kind of funny to me because, you know, we were talking about Basel II and all that stuff about the risk weighted capital requirements. Well, we kind of have this bifurcated system where we solve the problems for the <a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>previous iteration of financial regulations</u></a>. You know, we solve Basel II with <a href=\"https://files.modernmoney.network/M3F000001.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Basel III for banks and for bank holding companies</u></a>. Or we think we've solved it.</p><p>But then it's not like these kinds of <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>risk management practices have gone away</u></a>. I mean, they're not as bad as they used to be, but fundamentally, at the basic level, it's a lot of the same stuff.</p><p>The banks in 2005, in 2006, 2007 used <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>value-at-risk models</u></a>, which is a type of model of</p><p>trying to calculate risk from historical data, especially recent historical data, to see how risky, how volatile things are, to judge <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>how risky what they're doing is</u></a>. And so what happens when <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>volatility goes up a lot</u></a>, the value-at-risk model says, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>“there's a lot more risk out there.”</u></a></p><p>And then, again, they have that conversation about capital, about financial net worth. You're only supposed to be taking on a certain amount of risk for a certain amount of net worth or a “certain amount of capital”. When the risk models blow out suddenly, you're<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u> taking on way too much risk for your amount of capital</u></a> and the risk models are telling you, “you've got to deleverage, you've got to sell assets, pay back debts, shrink your balance sheet.”</p><p>But remember, the whole point, the reason that the hedge funds have become important in</p><p>the first place is that their balance sheets <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>can expand when they need to expand</u></a>. And so this is now creating<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u> the classic pro-cyclical situation</u></a>. Liquidity is there when you don't really feel like you need it, and when you really feel like you need it, it's not there.</p><p>Lev Menand, law professor at Columbia, and his colleague Josh Younger, who used to be at the New York Federal Reserve, called them <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>shadow dealers</u></a>. Shadow dealers are kind of similar to shadow money in the sense that they're providing this treasury dealer role. They're in the market to buy and sell, but <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>only when the times are good</u></a>. Normal dealers are licensed by the Federal Reserve. They are supposed to <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>always be there in the market</u></a>. They're always supposed to be bidding on auctions and the privileges that they get are supposed to come with <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-was-wrong-about-post-svb-treasury-market-strains-heres-why/\"><u>certain responsibilities</u></a>, and of course hedge funds have none of those responsibilities.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> So, what's happened now is that you’ve got volatility. Nobody knows what tariffs are going to be in place three days from now. And that ends up weighing on hedge funds, which feel the need to contract. I guess I would throw in that when you mentioned picking up pennies, I'm old enough to remember long-term capital management, which was a gigantic hedge fund and people always said that their business model was vacuuming up pennies from under the couch cushions on a global scale, and it was great until it wasn't, and then suddenly blew up and markets froze in 1998 when that happened. And you're saying that actually what we're looking at now is something like that happening again except now it’s the market for US treasuries that actually is freezing up.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yes. But the same sort of things are happening in all sorts of different markets that, superficially, you might not see as directly related to the initial thing. For various complicated historical reasons over the last 15 years, a system has been built up where if things get too erratic, liquidity dries up in <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>all these different parts of the system</u></a>. And there's no balance sheet that is able or willing to absorb what's going on, unless of course it's the Federal Reserve or the Federal Government's balance sheet.&nbsp;</p><p>But there's no private sector balance sheet that's willing to absorb the</p><p>assets <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>that are on there</u></a>. And where it comes back to Donald Trump. You have a system that works <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>unless volatility goes above a certain level</u></a>, Donald Trump is the perfect thing to give a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>heart attack to the system because he is volatility encapsulated</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> Okay, so it really is these highly leveraged actors out there who are really critical. You're saying it’s a market for treasuries and presumably a lot of other stuff as well. I mean, you're seeing spreads blow out on not just junk bonds, but sort of BAA corporate bonds, that sort of thing.</p><p>So the new climate of uncertainty basically forces the hedge funds—or high leverage</p><p>actors, but I guess that's basically hedge funds—to contract and sell stuff. And so you get spiking interest rates even on heretofore the safest assets in the world. For some of us, the fall on the dollar, that's different from March 2020. At that time, the dollar actually went up because America was still the safe haven. So why is the dollar now falling in the middle of all of this?</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>So, I think there's a few different things there. Before we get to exactly where the dollar is or why the dollar is falling in this situation, what I would emphasize is that liquidity is drying up everywhere.&nbsp; When I say everywhere,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u> I mean everywhere</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Liquidity in, like,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u> essentially currency trading</u></a>. The foreign exchange market also <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>kind of seized up last week</u></a>. There was an article in risk.net that said liquidity in the foreign exchange spot market was <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>worse than during COVID</u></a>. Some of these same things happened in COVID, but this happened more. And the article says that relative to the period leading up to this, volatility within a day (financial market participants use the phrase “intraday” for that) but <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>volatility went up more than five times</u></a>.</p><p>And so that volatility explosion is really the thing that's important in the foreign exchange market. Suddenly you really need to have big, big price movements where some entity with a balance sheet decides to step in and <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>absorb some position or another.</u></a></p><p>This also connects up to the last 15 years. These things are <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>called foreign exchange swaps</u></a>.</p><p>There's the type of derivative where you swap one currency for another, you swap yen for dollars, and then it'll go back the other way. You'll swap it at a different price at some time down the line—a week, a month, three months, whatever. And these have become the kind of focal <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>point of the financial system</u></a>.</p><p>As of June 2024, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>there was $113 trillion worth of foreign exchange swaps</u></a> out in the world, which is a mind-numbing number. The vast majority of that had dollars on one side. <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>87% of those swaps involved dollars</u></a>, which is a truly astounding amount. Dollars are so important to this system that generally speaking, when a Japanese bank wants euros or a European bank or a British bank wants yen, they don't just swap. The obvious thing would be to swap yen for euros.</p><p>Instead, they first swap yen for dollars and then swap dollars for euros. The dollar<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u> serves even as an intermediary between Japan and Europe, it's so central in these foreign exchange markets.</u></a></p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>Yeah. We call it the vehicle currency and it's what you take to get a ride from one currency to the other. But that role depends on dealers and the dealers need liquidity.&nbsp;</p><p>Wow. Okay.</p><p>So what you're saying is that all the foreign exchange markets, presumably corporate bond markets, treasuries, all of it depends upon liquidity supplied largely by hedge funds.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yes, in our current system. But<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u> also foreign hedge funds</u></a>. It's not just that domestic hedge funds have pulled back. It's also that there are foreign hedge funds. And this is where these foreign exchange swaps come in. I wrote a piece a couple of years ago called <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>The Utopian Vision of Financial Derivatives</u></a>,&nbsp; and what that piece was getting at is, if you're an ordinary person you might think lending to a New York real estate developer or lending to a regional Japanese government or lending to a British oil and gas company, that these are all different things.</p><p>But if you <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>have a certain kind of lens</u></a>, if you see the world through a certain set of rose-tinted glasses, all the financial market participant <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>sees are different kinds of risks that can be mixed and matched</u></a>. And I can turn any of those assets <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>into a kind of treasury bill</u></a>. I’ve just got to buy the right derivatives. So if I'm worried about them defaulting, then I can buy a credit default swap, which is just insurance against default. If I'm worried about the interest rates moving in a way that's bad for me, I'll buy an interest rate swap.</p><p>And so you can sort of just construct any sort of asset you want. And this works as long as you don't have to worry about actually getting paid by the other person who has your derivative. And this of course was <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>the big thing in the 2008 financial crisis</u></a>.&nbsp; The insurance giant AIG took one side of all of those <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>credit default swap bets and then couldn't pay up</u></a>. And then the federal government had to step in.</p><p>But even putting <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-utopian-vision-of-financial-derivatives-what-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-future-of-climate-policy/\"><u>aside the counterparty stuff</u></a>, there's also just this basic question of liquidity. My model says that when this certain event happens, the value of this asset will go down. But the model says the derivative should go up just enough to offset it. And so I haven't actually taken any loss. But the problem is, you don't actually know what's <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>going to be happening in the</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>liquidity</u></a>, whether the model value will line up because of things that can be going on in the world. For example, liquidity drying up everywhere. And there's no such thing as a private sector liquidity swap. And of course, even if there were, the obvious question would be: who guarantees liquidity for the liquidity swap?</p><p>And so ultimately, what happens is, there are all these investors who make decisions based on the idea that risks are just all swappable and they can get whatever kind of portfolio that they want with these products. And then it doesn't work in crisis times.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>Okay, and so we get this possibility that increased volatility means that the people who supply liquidity kind of go away, which means that all of these investments that were</p><p>supposed to be safe or at least limited risk because you had derivatives start to become</p><p>really problematic. So that's what you think is happening now to the markets.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Yeah, when volatility goes down, it gets better. But volatility is elevated if you <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>look at things like the VIX</u></a>, which is an index everyone relies on. It has gone down some. So things are kind of a little bit calmer right now, but they're still <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>quite elevated compared to what they were before all this started</u></a>. With other financial crises, there's all sorts of financial indicators that you can look at to judge whether a crisis is gonna get more severe. The issue is, because everything is just related to volatility and the volatility in this <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>situation is just related to Trump, there's no real financial expertise that can tell you exactly where this is going</u></a>. It's like, you just need a psychologist. You need someone who's somehow an expert in Trump's mind palace or the people around Trump and how they can manipulate him (or not) to judge whether</p><p>volatility is going to explode next week or whether it'll settle down and he'll just, you know, flip channels and not get so focused on the news that week.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> Yeah. So what's strange is that it's not even so much the level of tariffs. It’s the fact that you don't know what they're going to be. We had one radical break in the tariff regime on April 2nd and then it zipped in a completely different direction on April 9th and then another big change on April 12th. And that's what's really the problem.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> And that's why I said the financial system would do a lot better if Trump just committed to creating a depression. Then you'd be like, “okay, he's going to raise tariffs a lot.</p><p>He's going to stick to it. It's going to cause a global recession. But we know it's going to cause a global recession.” The <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>volatility now has been about trying to predict what will happen</u></a>. And all the back and forth. And those huge swings between “the economy will be fine” vs. “a depression is coming” is what's interacting with these <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>extant vulnerabilities in the financial system</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>I would say it's not clear you would be causing a depression if the policy</p><p>were stable. If we just had 25% tariffs. And everybody knew that was stable, then that would be a bad thing, but business would work with it. And it's not known whether they're 25% or 10% or 100%. That is the problem.</p><p>All right. In 2020, the Fed just stepped in and bought lots of treasuries. Is there a simple technical fix to this one? Why doesn't Jerome Powell just step in and rescue us from all of this?</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> Well, there's a couple things.&nbsp; We're talking about it kind of happening everywhere, and it kind of did happen everywhere in 2020, which is why there were all those <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-big-unanswered-questions-about/\"><u>other facilities around corporate debt</u></a>, around <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-reserves-coronavirus-f6a/\"><u>municipalities and so on</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>So these were not just treasury bonds. I didn't even know that. I'm embarrassed, but they did a bunch of facilities for other markets as well, not just buying Treasuries?</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-reserves-coronavirus-f6a/\"><u>Yeah, absolutely.</u></a></p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>Okay. So, sorry, go on.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>And so, they can step in on the liquidity issues. They're still worried about inflation and the tariffs are bringing up the question of inflation even more. So it’s kind of a full spectrum thing. They probably wouldn't do it unless <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/trumps-liberation-day-and-the-ongoing-stock-market-crash/\"><u>things got really, really bad</u></a>. But, I would expect,&nbsp; if the treasury market had gotten too chaotic for them, I think they would have</p><p>stepped in. And I think ultimately, even if there’s some awkwardness between some of the</p><p>things that they had said coming into this crisis, they would do that. And it would basically be fine.</p><p>The problem is, you know, in 2007, 2008, the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>volatility was about financial instability and recognizing the financial instability</u></a>. So stepping in to stabilize financial markets could slow down or make the volatility go away. But, you know, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/trumps-liberation-day-and-the-ongoing-stock-market-crash/\"><u>Jerome Powell can't make the volatility of Donald Trump go away.</u></a></p><p>And the Fed, for various reasons, both political but also kind of practical, wouldn't want to try to do a big audacious step in to deal with all the dysfunction related to Trump being unstable. I think if you ask them at a press conference, it would be like, “Well, it's the president's response.</p><p>The president is making a certain amount of decisions and he is pursuing a certain amount of economic policy and it's not our role to countermand him. And so if he wants to create a whole bunch of instability for his own reasons, that's essentially his business and we'll be concerned and we'll look at all the markets. But, you know, we hope there's a resolution to this and yada, yada, yada.”</p><p>So, doing a whole bunch of things probably wouldn't work that well and would also be stepping into the void or getting in the middle of this very charged political set of issues. As long as the Treasury can still make payments,&nbsp; they can let Trump get to a certain point and see if there's kind of a resolution to this situation. The Fed doesn’t want to be involved with this at all, or as little as it can. They would prefer there to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/19/powell-debt-ceiling-fed-00092522?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>be a political resolution</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And you kind of see similar things at a much lesser scale <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/more-foia-memos-the-feds-2013-treasury-default-memo-just-in-time-for-another-round-of-debt-ceiling-politics/\"><u>around the debt ceiling crises</u></a>, where they've tried to really step out of the way and see it as a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/more-foia-memos-the-feds-2013-treasury-default-memo-just-in-time-for-another-round-of-debt-ceiling-politics/\"><u>political issue to be resolved and only step in if they think something is irreversibly broken</u></a> or if that seems like it is about to happen.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>Okay, I'm not sure if this is a devil's advocate argument or not,&nbsp; but is there kind of a floor on how bad things can get? Because if the Fed steps in with facilities to address these kinds of balance sheets, and all the volatility contagion, if it's bad enough, they can always make sure that there is enough liquidity. They are essentially the buyer of last resort for a lot of assets.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus: </strong>Let me think about that. I think to a certain extent that's true, but only for short bursts.&nbsp; There's just a certain level of volatility where <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>some of these non-bank financial institutions will blow up</u></a>. I really think we were close to that Wednesday. I think if he had not backed off, if he had waited another day, we easily could <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>have had a firm or multiple firms blow up</u></a> and go down. And that's why <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>I brought up Lehman Brothers in one of my posts</u></a>.&nbsp; I saw it as that serious and frankly, I was trying to be one of the voices to be, like, “Hey, this is a Lehman moment. So back off and, you know, try not to blow up a number of firms.”</p><p>And I definitely think there is a level of volatility and a duration of volatility, like a set of days where, beyond that, we would see <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>multiple firms blow up</u></a>. And then there's also a question of international firms blowing up. And then of course, that brings up larger questions about the dollar. I think it'll be weeks, months, maybe even <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/our2025lehmanbrothers/\"><u>years before we fully understand just how close we came</u></a>. And there's a lot of people who are keeping their cards very close to the vest because you don't want to say that your firm was, like, 24 hours from blowing up or whatever.</p><p>But I think we're going to learn more extraordinarily alarming things about last Tuesday, last Wednesday than is currently acknowledged.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman: </strong>Just for time reference, April 2nd was the first big tariff announcement.</p><p>And that was a Wednesday. Weeks ago. And then basically a week after that, we were pretty close to the edge of a of a post-Lehmann style financial crisis. And then Trump announced a different set of tariffs that were actually, overall, maybe just as high, but different anyway, and were perceived as a step back from the brink.</p><p>And so you were saying that the financial system stepped back from the brink, but not that</p><p>far.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> Yeah. And volatility is still elevated. And this kind of goes back to the piece I put out the Tuesday before last, so I guess that's April 8th, which talked about the stock market.&nbsp;</p><p>These kinds of markets are <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>conventional wisdom processors</u></a>. That’s kind of a reference to Friedrich Hayek and the <a href=\"https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/37549/1/9783957961471-Markets.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com#page=41\"><u>idea of markets as an information processor</u></a>. It’s a little bit of the same thing but something different. The idea that <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>they’re conventional wisdom processors is that there's a general idea among a certain rarefied group of people</u></a> who are the most active participants in these markets and what is conventionally believed among them is really</p><p>what drives things, not access to information that any group of people have. Or a consensus among a different group of people.</p><p>The stock market would change very differently if suddenly, a week from now, all the major</p><p>stock traders were scientists. What they would price in, especially around things like climate change, would be very, very different from the current set of participants. So it's important.</p><p>The way people talk about markets is that there is an objective measure.&nbsp; That they just take information from everywhere and process them. But really, it's a specific set of people.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>As I say in that piece, you would have to have a specific mindset</u></a> and be a specific person in the world to believe that Donald Trump would be better for the stock market than Joe Biden. To believe not only that Donald Trump would be good for the stock market, that he'd be so much better than having four years of Kamala Harris or whatever, that you can track the odds of</p><p>Trump winning with the stock market going up <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>when Trump's odds of winning were going up</u></a>.</p><p>Like that's a particular kind of worldview. You know, people that we don't particularly like, people that we think were kind of nuts might have said that. And of course, not everyone on Wall Street believed that, but enough people believed it on Wall Street that it was taken as a conventional wisdom.</p><p>It's not something that you should sort of fight against when you're trading stocks and</p><p>trading in other financial markets. And that's a uniquely dangerous situation because that kind of person is the kind of person who's going to look for any off ramp, any <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>sort of little sign that things are going to be better</u></a>. And so when the stock market went up a whole bunch after Trump's announcement and volatility pared back some, it's not so much that these are more protectionist tariffs, at least as of last Wednesday—Of course, it's changed even more in the week since then. It's not like they were great, but it was just a headline in the news that would make people say, “My God, Trump is backing off. Okay, good.”</p><p>And what matters is not so much the reality of this thinking, but <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>how different factors interact</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>with each other</u></a>. And the media apparatuses present a general mood that comes from a certain perspective. It's so much that Trump needs to actually back off on tariffs or needs to be doing sane tariff policy, it just needs to be<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u> perceived as not crazy by these specific kind of idiosyncratic groups of people.</u></a></p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> Which does raise the question, if he really is going to be crazy, eventually that will filter through. So to some extent we may be getting a reprieve because the conventional wisdom is, it's really not so bad.&nbsp; But just to say, it took about two hours for people in my circle who actually were doing the tariff numbers to see that these new tariffs are basically the same overall tariff. It’s the same average tariff rate as before.</p><p>They're different, but they're just as bad. The market treated it as a major step back from the cliff. And so that was all that mattered in the moment.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> It may be motivated reasoning because of the politics, but I'm worried that there is another shoe to drop, that even now markets have not really processed just how unstable things are. Sounds like that's your sense.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> Yeah. It beggars belief that the tariff policy is not gonna pick up instability and that Trump is<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u> not gonna pick some crazy fight</u></a> where you get into this back and forth between, “is he gonna do it? Is he not gonna do it? Is he gonna do it?” So I think that kind of episode is gonna happen.</p><p>The other thing is just what we started with, the main thing that I've been focusing on, what I've been <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/can-the-trump-administration-arbitrarily-take-money-from-anyones-bank-account/\"><u>calling the Trump-Musk payments crisis</u></a>. The <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>impoundment issues and just sort of taking seizure of the federal government</u></a>. People used to talk about political risk being part of what gets priced in. Well, there's an enormous amount of political risk in the United States right now.</p><p>And then there's the further point where they’re in the process of claiming that<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u> they can take money out of anyone's bank account or freeze anyone's bank accoun</u></a>t. It's actually mind-bending trying to keep up with these stories of all the different ways that they're going after bank accounts. I mean, they froze a New York state government bank account related to EPA grants that were already handed out <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>that were being administered by Citibank</u></a>. And I want to dig into that more and write about it more. But that's just one of, I would say, four or five different payment stories that are calamitous.&nbsp;</p><p>Let alone their wanting to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-rebuild-social-security-administration-cobol-benefits/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>move social security off of COBOL, which we talked about. They want to do it within two to three months</u></a>, and they want to use AI to do it. I mean, that is an existential threat to social security existing. That’s a cockamamie plan. And I don't know what the current state of it is. I've been focusing on the financial crisis, so I need to get back into it. But I don't even know how to articulate how insane a disaster this is. And hey, there's a lot of financial risk if social security breaks and no one's getting social security checks.</p><p>And these kinds of risks are just like a dime a dozen right now, all across the</p><p>administrative state. And then there are other layers, forgetting even geopolitical things like,</p><p>are we invading Greenland? Maybe? All of these things are just so enormous.</p><p>That's why, you know, I didn't think I would succeed, but <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>why in that first week of the Trump-Musk payments crisis</u></a>, I was pretty conscious in that <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2025-02-05/bureau-of-the-fiscal-service-the-payment-system-elon-musk-has-access-to?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Odd Lots interview on Bloomberg</u></a>, to try to really hammer home just how potentially calamitous this is to the financial system and explicitly say that all these financial markets <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>should be pricing in these kind of uncertainties and they are not doing so</u></a>.</p><p>There are now questions that are burgeoning up on the dollar. I wrote a gigantic <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/is-the-trump-tariff-financial-crisis-a-crisis-of-the-dollar/\"><u>monster of a piece about that</u></a> on Sunday. I'm going to be writing some more big picture things about the dollar this week, but to me, the real question of a disaster, of a crisis, is when these people who suddenly have started to lose faith in the Trump administration's economic policy, that they start looking around and looking for other eventualities. They look at other things that are threats to the dollar, and come across the<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u> panoply of things that I've been covering and put two and two together</u></a>. If this payment system goes down, the whole fiscal machinery that makes the dollar <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u>the dollar is gonna collapse</u></a>.&nbsp; And then that could potentially be a<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u> second wave of the financial crisis.</u></a></p><p>But I don't know whether to put it as a bright side or a negative. And right now I'm kind of more inclined to see it as a negative but, even when something is kind of slammed in their face, like Trump's tariffs, they didn't really get the message until he had to slam their faces into the</p><p>pavement a few times.</p><p>Something like the Trump-Musk payments crisis, it's the kind of thing where,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-stock-market-is-a-conventional-wisdom-processor/\"><u> as Joe Weisenthal said at the end of that interview</u></a>, financial markets will only freak out when something actually breaks. But we can't wait for something to break. That is too dangerous. That's too calamitous.</p><p>They'll show up and say, “man, this problem is so bad,” when the building's already burned</p><p>down and is in a cinder.</p><p><strong>Paul Krugman:</strong> Maybe we should leave it there. I need a drink.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong> Well, let's get that drink.</p><p>Last thing I wanted to mention, and this is also a sign of how bad the crisis is: My lease on an office in Manhattan started yesterday, 2,000 square feet.

Two months ago I tried to crash the stock market. \n\nLet me explain.\n\nI have a story to tell about the first week of the Trump Musk Payments Crisis which is crucial to understand the turbulence in financial markets since “Liberation Day”.\n\nAs regular readers know by now, my entire world changed January 31st 2025. The news that David Lebryk, the top civil servant in the U.S. Treasury, was being pushed out for objecting to DOGE’s access to the Treasury’s payments systems at the Bureau of Fiscal Service, gave me a panic attack (for readers who need an introduction or a refresher, check out the interview Paul Krugman did with me.) That panic attack was about two things at once. The enormity of the dangerous implications of DOGE’s access to the Federal Government’s internal payments system was one. The second thing my panic attack was about was the nicheness of the knowledge. I knew first hand how few experts there were on the Treasury internal payments system because up to that date I couldn’t find an expert to answer my questions. I was completely overwhelmed by the prospect that a Venn Diagram of “people with relevant governmental payments system expertise” and “people with prominent media platforms willing to use that platform to straightforwardly communicate the terrifying danger” would leave only one person at the intersection. \n\nThis terrifying feeling was not helped by the half dozen or so conversations I had with former Federal Reserve and Treasury officials that weekend. They left me with the distinct impression that they were as alarmed as I was, and their plan A was… my newsletter. Let’s just say that in MY Plan A I am no well placed former government official’s plan A. \n\nSubscribe\n\nAnyway, at 1 AM Tuesday February 4th Wired reported that one DOGE employee, Marko Elez, had read and write code access. 6.5 hours later I confirmed their reporting in this very newsletter. Incidentally, I have not yet mentioned in the newsletter that on March 13th, in a piece dissecting what happened in that first week, Wired was able to credit my reporting in print (these things take time!). Wired cites me twice in their long piece:\n\nThe financial journalist and payments expert Nathan Tankus would later say that the news of Lebryk’s retirement gave him a “panic attack,” because everyone above Lebryk was a political appointee. [...] The fact of [DOGE employee Marko] Elez’s read/write access to Treasury payment systems, confirmed later by Tankus, became a source of contention. \n\nSo thank you to Wired.\n\nTip!\n\nI’m explaining all this to contextualize my mindset the first week of the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis. The Tuesday prior I was the publisher of a sleepy, in the weeds newsletter “breaking” stories about the Federal Reserve… from 1942. A week later I was suddenly an investigative journalist keeping pace with the country’s premier tech publication on a technology story. This is where the point of this piece comes into focus. I had a previously scheduled interview that day for Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast to talk about my 18 month effort to FOIA the Federal Reserve. \n\nObviously, I wasn’t going to be talking about FOIA. I talked about the Bureau of Fiscal Service and DOGE. But I had an agenda in mind. To understand that agenda, readers need to understand an extremely prescient newsletter from Odd Lots Co-Host Joe Weisenthal.\n\nThat November 7th piece, entitled “Beware The Stock Market Vigilantes”, is worth excerpting at great length:\n\nWhen the stock market is down, people feel bad. When it’s up people feel good. If you’re an American politician (or President specifically), you’re forced to be sensitive to this in a very direct way if you want to be elected. It’s not really the same with bonds. The policy-markets nexus is just tighter with stocks.\n\nFurthermore, because the stock market is how people fund their retirements (even for public employees with access to some kind of pension), pay for college, and so on, there’s arguably a limit to how long the American economic system can go without a rising stock market\n\nI think this gets operationalized in all kinds of notable ways:\n\nThis probably puts a constraint on populist, anti-market interventions. You saw this when the trade war with China started heating up under the first Trump administration, and there were days when the market’s reaction was sharply negative to the headlines. Those tariffs didn’t have a massive economic impact, and they didn’t have a massive market impact. But it seems reasonable to think about what a much more aggressive tariff regime would have on equities.\n\nThere’s also a constraint that emerges when thinking about re-industrialization efforts (efforts whose future is ambiguous under the next administration). The idea of investing more domestically in factories etc. sounds nice to a lot of people. But it’s a very costly process, with uncertain returns. Technological leadership is also not one-off thing that you just achieve one day. It’s a constant process of risky investment, which (if you don’t have a monopoly) keeps pushing profits further out into the future. \n\n[...]\n\nAnyway, to some extent this is just all theoretical talk right now. The stock market is at all time highs and surged since the election. So there’s no immediate source of concern here. For now this is not a source of pressure on the incoming Trump administration.\n\nBut I think it’s helpful when thinking about the range of future economic possibilities (with respect to trade policy, with respect to Fed personnel decisions, and so forth) to think about the power of the stock market in limiting, or putting a curb on, some of these outcomes. [Emphasis added]\n\nI think the prescience speaks for itself. The main relevant quibble I had when I read it last November was I thought the piece conveyed an impression that politicians had to react to stock market moves. I argued, among other things, that “governments react to stock market moves because they are socialized to see them as important.” Obviously, that claim is being put to the test right now.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAnyway, when I walked into Bloomberg’s headquarters Tuesday, February 4th I had this newsletter from Joe at the top of my mind. I desperately wanted to get Marko Elez out of the Bureau of Fiscal Service and I was going to muster any resource I could. So I did my best to call up some “Stock Market Vigilantes”. My hope was that a big stock market reaction that was clearly attributable to news of DOGE’s unvarnished access to the Treasury payments system could greatly increase the pressure on them to back off. \n\nAt the end of the interview, when Tracy Alloway asked me what could go wrong from DOGE mucking about in this system, I took direct aim at waking up some “heroic” stock market vigilantes:\n\nThere's no way to exaggerate how enormously dangerous this is. Every financial market in the world, in the country, in the world should be pricing in the operational failure uncertainties of this system. Every single financial market should be pricing it in, and none of them are. None of them are even close.\n\nWith the background context, it should be pretty obvious to readers that I was taking direct aim at the stock market. Really, I was taking direct aim at every financial market. Importantly, I wasn’t trying to “manipulate them”, at least not with false information. I was trying to get financial market participants to recognize the threat posed by a failure of the treasury’s payments system. “Pricing in” the potential for the treasury payments system to fail would mean higher interest rates for Treasury securities and far lower stock prices, among many other things. If the treasury fails, profits will be decimated. Indeed, a failure bad enough would make it an open question of whether the United States dollar would continue to exist. I wanted it to be priced into financial markets, so that it would go away.\n\nSubscribeTip!\n\nNow this is all less serious than it might sound because I knew, and Tracy and Joe knew, that it was exceedingly unlikely that financial markets would price in these uncertainties. In fact, Joe says as much in the epilogue of the interview:\n\n[T]he market will freak out when something happens. But before that, if something happens and there's a payment system, something gets broken, then we're going to see a market freak out. But everyone, until that moment is just always operates [as if] “in the end, the payments will be fine”. I don't think financial markets are good at situations like this where it's very binary, where it's like the default is you just sort of expect the payments to keep on running and everything is fine, et cetera. The default is you expect them to always raise the debt ceiling eventually when they have to, or the default as you expect the Fed to step in or whatever, mint a trillion dollar coin, but how to actually think about payments not actually happening, and there not being an easy way to fix this system. I, for one, am not surprised that it's hard to price that stuff in. [emphasis added]\n\nI knew this, and agreed with it when I heard Joe say it in front of me. But I was going to try my best anyway. I was trying everything. \n\nWhile I failed to crash the stock market, those in the know understood what I was trying to do. As the saying goes, “shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.” Plenty of people, including many powerful people, were alarmed by what they heard on that interview when it was released Wednesday, February 5th at 4:00 AM ET. I can’t currently talk about this aspect of my reporting in detail, but I can say that I have strong reason to believe that that Bloomberg Odd Lots interview specifically had a profound impact on the most senior former and current Federal Reserve and Treasury officials. The financial press opinion pages had not yet dramatized the importance of this story, indeed in my view they have not done so even two months later.\n\nSubscribe\n\nI can, however, confirm that the sweep of my reporting had a profound impact on high level current and former Treasury officials that week. In fact, two Biden era United States Treasury employees have agreed to exclusively go on the record with Notes on the Crises about this. Former senior advisor to the U.S. Treasury Chastity Murphy told me: \n\nFormer colleagues and I, both within and beyond the Treasury building, were deeply concerned about Elon Musk’s operational access to the Bureau of Fiscal Service’s payment system. Many, including senior officials, turned to “Notes on the Crises” for insights into the unfolding situation. [emphasis added]\n\nMeanwhile, Former senior advisor to the U.S. Treasury Anisha Steephen explained:\n\nThe alarm among the most senior former and current Treasury officials came from the truly unprecedented nature of what Bessent and Musk’s DOGE were doing. Never before had political appointees taken over the operation of the Treasury’s payment system or interfered with it in any way. We universally felt there was major risk to the integrity of the payment system and broader economy given its outsized importance. [...]\n\nNotes on the Crises provided the most in-depth view of what was going on at the Fiscal Service.  Most importantly, Nathan elevated the issue beyond the usual D.C. circles and explained why it matters to people. Americans pay attention when an issue like this is in Rolling Stone\n\nAnisha’s statements are especially interesting because as a “term appointee” they remained at Treasury into the early Trump administration and, by chance, left the same day that David Lebryk did. \n\nSubscribeTip!\n\nObviously I’ll have more to say about the role Notes on the Crises played at the very highest levels that first week of February in the future based on these quotes (and much else).\n\nBut today, that’s not the important thing.\n\nThe important thing is what this tells us about the big picture. The alarm of former and current government officials about the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis did not and has not translated into conventional wisdom on Wall Street. And without conventional wisdom, financial markets won’t move. This process isn’t magical, nor do financial markets have some divine and indescribable magic. They are made of people. And not just any people, people with very particular ideological outlooks on the world. This is a group of people that did not simply believe the stock market would do well under Trump, they thought it would do significantly better under Trump than under Biden. They sufficiently believed this that fluctuation in the “odds” of a Trump victory directly translated into the behavior of the stock market. Or at least, the average wall street stock trader believed the average wall street stock trader believed that. But we won’t get into that mess right now.\n\nIf conventional wisdom among financial market participants was determined by the policy expert circles I run in, the threat of Trump’s tariffs would have led to a stock market crash in November. This past week is the first confrontation with reality during the second Trump administration that Wall Street has had as a collective. And that’s tariffs, a policy area with a wide and deep bench of expertise. The Trump-Musk Payments Crisis is still very obscure. I’ve got my work cut out for me before this threat becomes conventional wisdom. And Joe is likely right- payments may need to really melt down in a way that hits Wall Street before financial market traders ever take it truly seriously. We can’t afford to wait for that.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAs of this writing, S&P futures are trading higher than the S&P’s closing price on Friday. I won’t make any claims about what will happen today, or really this week. We’ll see if financial markets stabilize or if this is just a prelude. What I will say is that the second Trump administration has benefited greatly so far by the presumption that policies that are “too negative” from the perspective of wall street would be rolled back once the negative impacts were known. Put simply, the stock market has not crashed up until now on the assumption that the second Trump administration would not “stay the course” on policies that crashed the stock market. Put this way, I hope readers can understand what a strange catch 22 this is. There is no greater reason to think that Trump’s crazy and erratic policies will be reversed than there is to think they will be permanent. The only difference is that the latter would put far greater pressure on a president as a stock market convention and provide more of a check on a president’s  brazen lawlessness.\n\nThe reality of a stock market crash is not quite serving as the constraint that Joe Weisenthal envisioned. But I’d rather have the stock market crashing than not have the stock market crash. And the sharper and more negatively it crashes in response to Trump’s bad behavior, the more likely that behavior will be curbed. Curbing that bad behavior is valuable to all of us. Ironically, it’s even more valuable to wall street itself. But try telling them that.","html":"<p><strong>The extensive “Notes on the Crises Investigative Journalism Source Wish List” </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/notes-on-the-crises-investigative-journalism-source-wish-list/\"><strong><u>can be found here</u></strong></a><strong>.

Two months ago I tried to crash the stock market.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me explain. </p><p>I have a story to tell about the first week of the Trump Musk Payments Crisis which is crucial to understand the turbulence in financial markets <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/04/April-2nd-2025-National-Liberation-Day-Trump-transcript.pdf\"><u>since “Liberation Day”</u></a>.</p><p>As regular readers know by now, my entire world changed January 31st 2025. The news that David Lebryk, the top civil servant in the U.S. Treasury, was being pushed out for objecting to DOGE’s access to the Treasury’s payments systems at the Bureau of Fiscal Service, gave me a panic attack (for readers who need an introduction or a refresher, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/musk-in-your-computers-paul-krugman-interviews-nathan-tankus/\"><u>check out the interview Paul Krugman did with me</u></a>.) That panic attack was about two things at once. The enormity of the dangerous implications of DOGE’s access to the Federal Government’s internal payments system was one. The second thing my panic attack was about was the nicheness of the knowledge. I knew first hand how few experts there were on the Treasury internal payments system because up to that date I couldn’t find an expert to answer <strong>my questions</strong>. I was completely overwhelmed by the prospect that a Venn Diagram of “people with relevant governmental payments system expertise” and “people with prominent media platforms willing to use that platform to straightforwardly communicate the terrifying danger” would leave only one person at the intersection.&nbsp;</p><p>This terrifying feeling was not helped by the half dozen or so conversations I had with former Federal Reserve and Treasury officials that weekend. They left me with the distinct impression that they were as alarmed as I was, and their plan A was… my newsletter. Let’s just say that in MY Plan A I am no well placed former government official’s plan A.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Anyway, at 1 AM Tuesday February 4th Wired reported that one DOGE employee, Marko Elez, had read and write code access. 6.5 hours later <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>I confirmed their reporting in this very newsletter</u></a>. Incidentally, I have not yet mentioned in the newsletter that on March 13th, in a piece dissecting what happened in that first week, Wired was <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>able to credit my reporting</u></a> in print (these things take time!). Wired cites me twice in their long piece:</p><blockquote>The financial journalist and payments expert Nathan Tankus would later say that the news of Lebryk’s retirement gave him a “panic attack,” because everyone above Lebryk was a political appointee. [...] The fact of [DOGE employee Marko] Elez’s read/write access to Treasury payment systems, confirmed later by Tankus, became a source of contention.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>So thank you to Wired.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/support\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Tip!</a></div><p>I’m explaining all this to contextualize my mindset the first week of the Trump-Musk Payments Crisis. The Tuesday prior I was the publisher of a sleepy, in the weeds newsletter “breaking” stories about the Federal Reserve… <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/does-restricting-treasury-purchases-to-the-open-market-matter-long-forgotten-secret-federal-reserve-memo-says-no-monetarypolicy201/\"><u>from 1942</u></a>. A week later I was suddenly an investigative journalist keeping pace with the country’s premier tech publication on a technology story. This is where the point of this piece comes into focus. I had a previously scheduled interview <strong>that day</strong> for Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast to talk about <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/here-are-the-30-000-pages-of-federal-reserve-board-meeting-minutes-i-got-through-foia/\"><u>my 18 month effort</u></a> to FOIA the Federal Reserve.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, I wasn’t going to be talking about FOIA.<u> </u><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2025-02-05/bureau-of-the-fiscal-service-the-payment-system-elon-musk-has-access-to?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>I talked about the Bureau of Fiscal Servic</u></a>e and DOGE. But I had an agenda in mind. To understand that agenda, readers need to understand an extremely prescient newsletter from Odd Lots Co-Host Joe Weisenthal.</p><p>That November 7th piece, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-07/beware-the-stock-market-vigilantes?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NDA5NjI0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ0NzAxMDQ1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTTUw5TUdUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI1RTg4QjY1RTZBMjI0OTEzQThERDA1QjBEOEI5M0NBOCJ9.tXYTH_7vJTnCwKwsVikTZT0MLP0-BC0M9M2qHGFhkbQ&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>entitled “Beware The Stock Market Vigilantes”</u></a>, is worth excerpting at great length:</p><blockquote>When the stock market is down, people feel bad.

What I will say is that the second Trump administration has benefited greatly so far by the presumption that policies that are “too negative” from the perspective of wall street would be rolled back once the negative impacts were known. Put simply, the stock market has not crashed up until now on the assumption that the second Trump administration would not “stay the course” on policies that crashed the stock market. Put this way, I hope readers can understand what a strange catch 22 this is. There is no greater reason to think that Trump’s crazy and erratic policies will be reversed than there is to think they will be permanent. The only difference is that the latter would put far greater pressure on a president as a stock market convention and provide more of a check on a president’s&nbsp; brazen lawlessness.</p><p>The reality of a stock market crash is not quite serving as the constraint that Joe Weisenthal envisioned. But I’d rather have the stock market crashing than not have the stock market crash. And the sharper and more negatively it crashes in response to Trump’s bad behavior, the more likely that behavior will be curbed. Curbing that bad behavior is valuable to all of us. Ironically, it’s even more valuable to wall street itself.

But it never occurred to me that Musk’s people would try to seize control of the computer systems that, in effect, cut all the checks the federal government sends out. In fact, very few people realized it was happening.\n\nOne person who did realize it, however, was Nathan Tankus — an independent expert on the financial “plumbing” at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. So Nathan suddenly became the man of the moment. His blog Notes on the Crises has become crucial reading — and he may have helped steer us, temporarily at least, away from the edge of the abyss.\n\nSo I interviewed him a few days ago. Below you’ll find a slightly edited version of the video and a very slightly cleaned-up version of the transcript. It seems to me that getting the information out is more important than having slick production values.\n\nAlso, no paywall on this one; it was a lot of work, but it’s too important to shut off anyone’s access.\n\nAnd here we go:\n\nPrinter Friendly Version\n\n[Find the Youtube video embedded above and linked here (I will be having my website redesigned so that, among other things, embedded youtube videos look nicer)]\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nKrugman: Hi, I'm Paul Krugman. This is the latest in my series of videos. I thought it would be really interesting to talk to Nathan Tankus, who has ended up playing a really remarkable role in helping to at least make us aware of and possibly take some precautions against what looks like a kind of digital takeover by Elon Musk's people. And we'll get into all of that. But I first want to ask, Nathan, if you could talk a little bit about your background and how you came to be in this position. As I understand it, you're kind of a financial plumbing expert, if we could say that. Would that be a fair description?\n\nTankus: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nKrugman: Were you at the Fed or at the Treasury?\n\nTankus: No, I'm a pure outsider.\n\nKrugman: An outsider but you've paid a lot of attention to what they do. We think that management says ‘send money there’ and it just happens but it's actually a very elaborate process, right?\n\nTankus: Absolutely. You asked about my background, how I came to this. So I feel like that's an opportunity to go way back in my history. And for me, this all started in January 2009. I'm 33 so in January 2009 I was still in high school and I went to a kind of small alternative public high school called Urban Academy and I had two teachers who just taught a class called Show Me the Money where we read selections of the newspaper each week. We read, I don't know, probably a dozen Paul Krugman blog posts or columns and I started reading your blog every day, among a whole bunch of other blogs, and I just became obsessed. So I'm one of these people who was really kind of woken up by the Great Financial Crisis and it captured their imagination and just rolled with that. I've kind of bounced around a lot of different things since then, but in meantime, picked up a lot of knowledge where I got to the point where I was actually asking such kind of interesting detailed questions where people, even former treasury or federal reserve people, would be willing to talk to me because I was asking the kind of questions that no one else was asking. And so that 15 year journey, which involved, like, a big success during the beginning of coronavirus, has kind of brought me to this place, this unique position to be able to write about these kinds of things.\n\nKrugman: Just tell me what was the success with coronavirus?\n\nTankus: I started my newsletter Notes on the Crises on March 19th, 2020, because it was clear to me that there was going to be a lot of economic impacts. There already were at that point, but there were going to be a lot more and they weren't very well understood. And anyone who had any sort of expertise or knowledge with what the Federal Reserve was doing, what were called “crisis facilities,” where they launched these suites of programs that were going to support the financial system, support municipalities, state and local government, support the corporate sector, and that anyone who had detailed knowledge of those programs was either in government, at a think tank (and thus had to be doing all sorts of things assigned by their bosses), a journalist who was too busy covering the big picture stuff to get into the details, or was a professor who was trying to figure out how to teach on Zoom suddenly in the middle of a semester. And so I had a unique opportunity as someone who was kind of a total outsider, did not have a nine to five job that made me commit to doing some other set of activities. So I could just devote all my time to writing about it. That first four months, I wrote a piece every other day, including weekends on average. Just, you know, that first month I put out 21 pieces and that sort of big rush is what made my career. Bloomberg Business Week did a profile on me. So in a strange way, I've kind of already had this experience that I've been having for the past month, but obviously this month has been much more intense and much more dramatic.\n\nKrugman: OK, we stepped up to help people through this—what I was calling a ‘medically induced coma for the economy’ during Covid. But that involved trying to get money out in unusual, unprecedented ways and presumably was technically very demanding. And you were writing about that then.\n\nTankus: Absolutely. I was largely focused on the Federal Reserve, but I had interest in other things, including state unemployment insurance and actually how, as we'll get to in a bit, related to this, how their COBOL systems made updating them very technically complex. So for example, why the unemployment insurance checks were an additional $600 a week, rather than say, “We're going to replace 80% of your income.” It was just too technically complicated in the time available to program 80% or replacement rates. And so they just slapped on adding $600 a week to everyone's check because that was technically easier.\n\nKrugman: That's interesting. I knew that the number 600 was based on average earnings. But I didn't think about why it was a fixed number... But yeah, I do remember the state of New Jersey, which is where I was at the time, putting out a desperate appeal for people who knew how to program in COBOL. Because basically nobody knows how to do that anymore.\n\nTankus: Yeah. I desperately tried to get my dad to take up New Jersey's call, but he had just retired December 2019 and he had no interest whatsoever.\n\nKrugman: So you were looking at the Fed's efforts. I know that obviously the Fed has to have been doing extraordinary stuff to maintain liquidity, but I wasn't really paying attention to that side of it. Just a word or two, maybe too technical for a lot of people, but just what were they doing that was especially unusual and difficult?\n\nTankus: The vast majority of the programs that they launched were similar to programs that they had launched in 2008 in response to the great financial crisis. And so these were a suite of programs that were designed to do what worked in normal times: preserve liquidity to the banking system and wider financial markets. Normally you just rely on financial market participants to do that and the Fed is operating quietly in the background as a backstop, and they had to take on that explicitly. So, normally you provide liquidity to the banking system. The banking system makes sure that wider financial market participants have liquidity. They make sure that say, you know, corporate bonds are liquid and that, you know, corporations can borrow at a pretty reasonable rate or rather a rate that is in line with the Fed's broader monetary policy. But all of the sort of creaking conditions of financial markets breaking down in response to the disruptions expected by COVID meant that what the Fed usually does implicitly, it felt like it had to do explicitly. So it launched a primary corporate credit market facility and a secondary corporate credit market facility, which is really just a fancy way of saying they directly lent to corporations or they bought corporate debt off of financial market participants who had this corporate debt, or anyone who really needed to sell it. And they launched those kind of programs for state and local governments all across the board.\n\nThey just made sure that anyone who needed liquidity essentially had it and that if things were going to break down, they were going to break down by COVID's direct effects and not by not being able to borrow money.\n\nKrugman: For listeners, I know a little bit, but only a little bit about this. In normal times, certainly the way that textbooks teach it, the Fed buys treasury bills from banks. That's how the Fed gets money out into the economy, which is straightforward. But when everything is breaking down, they can't count on the money actually getting out there to where it's needed. I knew people who worked on their commercial paper facility in 2009, which was basically, roughly speaking, small business lending. Normally the Fed would just put money into the banks and expect it to find its way, but the market wasn't working. So the Fed was doing this on a much wider scale. And you were tracking how they were actually doing this, so, paying attention to the specific programs.\n\nTankus: Absolutely. I wrote this big seven part series on all the details where, literally, I went through every press release that the Federal Reserve released since the beginning of February, 2020, and just tried to provide a simple-as-possible explanation of every single press release. And that kind of comprehensive detailed painstaking work got a lot of attention.\n\nKrugman: That's really interesting. Last week I did a conversation with Jim Chanos, the famous short seller, and he would base his research, not on having spies, but on actually just taking stuff that was in the public domain, but actually reading it. It sounds like that's what you were doing.\n\nTankus: Absolutely. That is definitely the kind of approach that I've developed to understanding things. And I've kind of reached the point of reading whatever's in the public domain in detail enough that people want to talk to me. I've now reached the point where I've read so much of that stuff that the bankers and former Fed and Treasury and maybe current people want to talk to me.\n\nKrugman: Okay. Is there something else you want to tell us about the background before we move up to the current crisis?\n\nTankus: I think that is it. I think the one thing I would say is, I'm known as a Federal Reserve person because I did that big thing during coronavirus. I'm known as a Fed person. And so to some people, it's a little strange getting into what we're going to talk about, where it seems kind of the Fed's there, but it's in the background. It's a side detail in this story, which maybe will unfortunately become more important in the coming months. And so people are kind of like, well, what is this? And I kind of have a general interest in payment systems, in the monetary system, in the financial system, how Congress's budgetary process works, you know, kind of all of these things in all of their complex interrelations. And that's a lot of what my colleagues and I do at the Modern Money Network, where I'm a research director.\n\nKrugman: Okay. You were doing the Fed back then, but Treasury also has a part. Obviously, there's a lot of plumbing involved. If the Secretary of the Treasury says issue checks to a bunch of people and Treasury Secretary says ‘make it so,’ what I hadn't realized was there is basically an agency, an office, there's a particular relatively small unit in Treasury that makes that happen. What's that? A bureau. The bureau of the treasury, which is actually kind of what for normal, inaccurate language, kind of cuts the checks, right? Is that a fair description?\n\nTankus: Absolutely. That's a fair description, Paul.\n\nKrugman: And their normal role is simple. They don't verify whether something is a good policy. That's not their job. They don't verify whether the people are deserving. They just sort of verify whether this has been authorized. Is that right?\n\nTankus: Yeah, that's exactly correct. You can kind of think about it with your bank. If you write a check and say, ‘I've got to pay this bill, I've got to pay my utility bill,’ maybe they can tell from the name of the company that it's your utility company. But they don't say, ‘hey, what type of thing are you spending on? Is this for alcohol? I don't think that is good for you. We're going to have this check bounce. You're going to have to pay a whole bunch of fees because you're not supposed to be buying that.’ That's exactly what we generally don't want a payment system to do. We don't want there to be like a Payments Big Brother that tells us ‘you can have this, but you can't have that.’ The example I used in one of my articles is, conservatives don't want there to be some liberal person in the payment system limiting how much meat you can buy in a month.\n\nKrugman: If you are using a debit card, they do have fraud algorithms, departments, that will flag a transaction as looking like the kind of thing you usually don’t buy or doesn't look like your spending. So I'll get a text and say, ‘respond yes or no,’ which is, I guess, a protection. But anyway, there may be a little bit of that going on here as well but basically, ‘does it look like a properly authorized payment,’ right?\n\nTankus: Yeah, that's a great example, actually, because, you know, we'll get into more of the details in a second of the various other systems. But when this bureau, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, sends out payments, it doesn't just actually [just] send out a payment. It checks a payment. It does a final check. You know, there's supposed to be other processes that check, but they do a last check against a system which is called officially the Do Not Pay system. And there's various parts of this system which flags if, you know, ‘is the person getting this check dead,’ that kind of thing. But, if you get flagged by Do Not Pay, they don't then say, ‘Well, alright, this payment's not going out.’ All that is just a check, and then they send it back to the agency. The same way that you get that text message that says, ‘hey, did you really mean to make this payment?’ They send it back to the agency and say, ‘hey, did you really mean to make this payment?’ Or maybe there's an issue with this payment. ‘Look further into it.’ But if the agency comes back and goes, ‘Hey. No, this payment is legit. Send this payment.’ They're not going to overrule them. And so this system does it in a more complicated way but does the same thing as your bank, saying, ‘hey, did you really mean to make that debit card transaction?’\n\nKrugman: Okay. And by the way, sometimes it works, you know? There was somebody ordering basically from the equivalent of Uber Eats, but in Britain and was ordering Indian food in a suburb of London on my card. That was not me.\n\nBut, okay, how big is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service? How many people are we talking about roughly? It's quite tiny, right?\n\nTankus: I don't have the employment right off the top of my head, but I would guess, like, let's call it 2,000 - 3,000 people [Editorial note, I was close. They had nearly 2000 “Full Time Equivalent” employees in Fiscal Year 2020 & 2021 and 1826 in Fiscal Year 2024] and it handles around $5 trillion of payments.\n\nKrugman: So this is really quite a small agency, but its job is not to decide what's a good payment. Okay, so you became aware that some of Elon Musk's people were getting access to this Bureau. Tell me what was... it was actually just news stories, right? So, what did Nathan Tankus know and how did he know it?\n\nTankus: Friday, January 31st, I had just put out a big piece about how we already were in a constitutional crisis. I described a five alarm fire constitutional crisis. There had just been this implementation memo from the Office of Management and Budget directing a sweeping freezing of spending across the federal government until the Trump administration could review it. This caused immediate chaos. The Medicaid portals to send payments out through Medicaid went down. This had caused such an immediate disruption that they had to rescind the memo, but they hadn't rescinded the executive orders that were driving this memo. And so I wrote a long piece about why this is a big deal. Why, what's called impoundment, which is not spending what Congress directs or appropriates to be spent, is a big deal, why it's a constitutional crisis, why it is like a fundamental demotion of Congress's role in our constitutional system. So I was already focused on this issue and I was already pretty concerned.\n\nYou know, my newsletter is called Notes on the Crises. So, I'm paying attention to crisis. Crisis is, you know, when people are really reading my articles and when you're really getting a lot of them, that's when you know something's really, really wrong, you know? So I was already focused on this. And in an article in the Washington Post I had seen a headline about how a high level person in the Treasury had resigned in protest or is on leave or something, but related to the treasury's payment system. And as a payments expert, that headline was incredibly alarming. So alarming, in fact, that I put it aside and I couldn't get myself to read it for a few hours. I had gotten caught up with promoting my piece that day, so I hadn't eaten that day. So I was like, ‘I'm gonna go get something to eat.’\n\nAnd my friend, colleague, the economist Stephanie Kelton at Stony Brook, when I told her that, she had already read the article and was already alarmed. She said, ‘I don't think that's the right order.’ But nevertheless, I hadn't eaten that day. So I went to go eat, and then I went to go read it. I mean, literally, four paragraphs into this article, I had a panic attack. It was possibly the scariest or one of the scariest moments of my life when I read that article. And it was so scary to me because what the article said was that the Fiscal Assistant Secretary, who's the highest civil servant in the treasury, where everyone above him are political appointees. You know, there's that top layer of every agency which are political appointees that, you might fire the old people, you fire the Biden administration or the Trump people, and you bring in your people. That’s a normal expected part of government. But everyone below them are supposed to be professional civil servants who were doing the job regardless of the partisan status of the executive branch, regardless of who is president. And the fact that this person had been pushed out because DOGE and Elon Musk in the Department of Government Efficiency were asking to have access to the Treasury and this guy, a long time official, someone who'd been in the government since 1989, had been in this highest status position since 10 years ago had been widely credited as the person who has expertly managed the treasury and payments throughout the various debt ceiling crises where you're trying to squeeze every dollar and make sure payments go out without breaching the debt ceiling. I immediately understood how desperately serious and what the worst case scenarios could be and was overwhelmed by it. And I was also overwhelmed and alarmed as an expert in this area that so few people understood how serious this was that it was, and that it was going to be, that it's not just that this was so dangerous, but that there was very few people who were in a position to really say anything about this. And to be frank, my newsletter is called Notes on the Crises. I have 50,000 people on my email list, some already very high-powered, powerful people who—I'm not going to name names—but I know that they're there. And it might seem a little strange, absent context, but I knew immediately that this was basically up to me.\n\nKrugman: Right.\n\nTankus:\n\nSo, you know, more or less, to get the word out there and to race against the clock of whatever DOGE was gonna do and before they actually could get in there, you know? And so taking the opportunity of what I hoped gave me the weekend, like literally just the time of the weekend, hopefully the DOGE kids were going out, you know, doing drugs somewhere else and not actually at the Treasury, and take that opportunity to write as fast as I could, research as fast as I could to have a piece out Monday morning. I successfully accomplished that. I also managed to concurrently have a simpler version of my piece run in Rolling Stone at the same time and, you know, then hit the ground running, made sure to get a haircut Sunday night, had the, you know, brain space to do that because I knew I was going to be doing video interviews the next day.\n\nKrugman: Just to be clear, impoundment is like the director of the Office of Small Animals gets a memo saying no money for rabbits, even though Congress has allocated it. But this is some guy, some 19-year-old or whatever from DOGE gets into the computers and possibly, and we need to talk about this, possibly alters the code so that no money goes out for rabbits or possibly just doesn't know what the hell he's doing and just crashes the system. Is that a fair characterization?\n\nTankus: Exactly. There's one person in Marko Elez, a 25 year old who used to work at SpaceX. He's, you know—as we'll get to—he's out of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service now, but he's just been sent over to the Social Security Administration.\n\nKrugman: Which is wonderful. I'm actually getting checks from the SSA myself now, although it's not important for me, but it's absolutely critical for like 80% of people my age. Before we get a little nonlinear here, but kids. Elez would be like almost the oldest of this team, right? These were real kids. And I've been seeing some theorizing about why are we getting really such young people with often with very questionable things in their backgrounds. What's your take on that? And I'll give you the one I've heard from other people.\n\nTankus: So it's not something I've looked into a ton, but my impression is these are people who adore Elon Musk, are very personally loyal to him, are willing to do some very unusual things because they do not have a professional background. ‘This is cool and awesome and the internet and, you know, I'm a Reddit kid who gets to screw with the federal government in real life.’ I also think these kids are expendable. And also, I think the fact that these kids are kind of racist kids from chat lines who tweet like Marko Elez did to ‘normalize Indian hate’, these things are useful because it means that if things get too hot there's a reason you can get rid of one of these kids. You can cite racist posts which, as we'll get into, is what happened with Marko Elez even though that's not actually why they're getting kicked out of the government, and so it's a perfect shield to make sure that there's as much confusion and obfuscation about just how serious what Musk is doing on behalf of the Trump administration.\n\nKrugman: Yeah, that's not too different. The theory that I heard, Josh Marshall (TalkingPointsMemo.com), has a post on all that, and has said that these guys are being asked to do things that are quite likely illegal and that if you're a 35 year old experienced guy with a background and a career, you could blow up your life. But these are twenty-something-at-most guys who don't have that, who don't themselves have much to lose.\n\nTankus:\n\nYeah.\n\nKrugman:\n\nI don't know if you've seen it, but there's this point in Oppenheimer where’s he’s dealing with General Groves, who pretends to be a dumb general, but is actually not. And he suddenly realizes, ‘you didn't hire me despite my communist connections. You hired me because of them, because that means that you can get rid of me whenever you want.’ Ok, so these kids come in. And what are they doing?\n\nTankus:\n\nWell, first I would just say overwhelmingly, we don't really know. I mean, the full scope of what these people are doing is not very clear. It's, of course, under very unclear authority, likely illegal in so many cases. And so the most dangerous thing is just how little we know. In this case, with Marko Elez getting in there, it seems to be downloading data. For a time, I had sources right in the Bureau of the Fiscal Service office or building where he was bouncing around looking at all these very sensitive systems and my sources could see him download data. But the systems are so sensitive that even senior IT people in these places could see that Marko Elez was downloading data but couldn't see what the data was because these systems are so sensitive, even they don't have access to them.\n\nKrugman: Okay, this downloaded data could be personal information, could be business information, it could be, I mean, the federal government has, you know, as you say, five trillion in spending, so it's got fingers in all kinds of areas, it has information on all kinds of things, so this could be just downloading information that could be used to Elon Musk's business advantage, could be used in various ways to pressure people. So one possibility was simply that they were getting access to data that is supposed to be very carefully protected. As you say, even senior people don't have that kind of access. There was also the question about whether he or some other people were able to—and I understand it's not that clear a distinction—but were able to actually rewrite some of the code. Can you explain to me what we're all talking about there and what the concerns are?\n\nTankus: Yeah, so this is still kind of shrouded in confusion. There should be an independent investigation of what exactly Marko Elez was doing. For a time the Fiscal Service people seemed to be investigating and were very upset about him bouncing around after he was out and were literally treating it like it was a cyber security incident, like it was. Like they had been hacked because in a certain sense they had been. But obviously, the pressure from high up, from Treasury Secretary Bessent kind of squashed that. Even a subcontractor from Booz Allen, who wrote a memo about the cyber security risks, the huge cyber security risk, the dangers of having Marko Elez around, was fired for writing that report. Now there's a court case where people have been testifying under oath about what was going on. So it's still not exactly clear what is happening.\n\nWhat I would emphasize about this, like literally Marko Elez rewriting the code, is in a certain sense, you know, this was important, it was dramatic, it was something that both Wired and I were breaking stories about that was bringing attention and seriousness to it. But at a larger policy level, that kind of thing is kind of a sideshow. I followed along with it to keep attention on the story and to keep the pressure on, but the policy conclusion from my point of view was the same regardless of any of the stories that I broke or not. Because the point of looking at data, even if you only have read access where you can look at the data, is to propose changes. The purpose of even just gaining enough control where you can tell the civil service people what to do, even if they're the ones actually looking at the code, is to get them to do things. One explosive court filing is that already by the time that I had come to find out about this on January 31st, they had been at the payments level of blocking payments, which, what I mean is there's literally these payment files written basically the same way they would be written in the 1970s that get processed through these systems and get sent on to the Federal Reserve to be processed by ACH, Automated Clearing House, which is how any sort of small or medium-sized value payment works. You get a payment from Social Security and it's a direct deposit to your account, it is an ACH payment. That's the system.\n\nAnd they were literally just taking the files and going, ‘we're not handing those over. We're not processing this because we're shutting down USAID.’ And as we know, they've now taken over the building and shut down USAID, but they were also doing that at the payments level. And so with the Hamilton Projects tracker, you can see the payments from USAID go to zero, literally zero January 28th. So they were literally doing this. [nuanced correction of these statements from 03/04/2025 can be found here]\n\nKrugman: So that's before they actually seized the building and told everybody to go home. They actually just stopped the payments. Wow. So I was going to offer a hypothetical, but I don't need to. That's an actual case. They just sort of made the judgment, decided we don't like USAID and without even telling the officials at USAID to stop paying the money or before we get around to that, we just tell the computer to stop making the payments.\n\nTankus: Exactly. And there is an even further incident that the court filings reveal that I reported on last week [two weeks ago] that really flagged the importance that no one had really caught, something even more dramatic and eye opening. Something I would have felt would be too out there for me to have speculated on when I was writing about the worst case scenarios. They had been using these payment codes, what are called treasury account symbols, which is complicated, but basically what it means is you're associating a specific type of payment with a specific type of appropriations, the type of legislation from Congress that authorizes spending. And they figured out what codes related to money for refugees. And they flagged three payments, three appropriations for three payment files related to refugees, funding the administrative expenses of programs to bring literally refugee aid to women and children in other countries, and then a couple others of a similar tenor, and flagged them.\n\nKrugman: Wow.\n\nTankus: Which, you know, sounds technical. But to me, what’s extremely dramatic, is that this spending was not USAID spending. This spending was Health and Human Services Department spending. And so they flagged the payments, the payment files, and sent them back to review. But they did not send them back to Health and Human Services. They've sent them to the State Department for the State Department to look over whether they were consistent with Trump's executive orders. So to really break that down, they were talking to one agency, which maybe they feel like they've already gotten their favorite people in there. ‘You look over and tell us whether we should stop these payments and completely cut out the agency that that spending is, the agency that sent the payment files over.’ So they were already going so far as basically just, ‘we're gonna have essentially our favorite people look and pick and choose what type of appropriations, what type of specific type of spending is gonna go out.’ Now, that spending ultimately did go out according to court documents, but this happened even faster than I thought it had or could have when I was writing about this at the beginning when I was already very, very alarmed about what was going on. And now there are court injunctions against all this stuff, but who knows really where this goes.\n\nKrugman: Okay, and so this is impoundment of anything that, you know, looks like DEI to these guys or whatever. I'm told that even in the military, people who are doing things like transnational cooperation have been renaming it because they're afraid that the word trans will be flagged. But this is whole categories of spending, and it's not even a person who has to say stop it or at some point it has to be reviewed but they're just mucking with the file and stopping payments and no attention to what legislation may say or whatever. That's amazing.\n\nTankus: Yeah, it's truly remarkable. And I really want to emphasize how dramatic this is. I talked about how I wrote about impoundment, what I've been calling ‘part zero’ on January 31st, and talked about the huge disruption of, say, payment portals going down in all 50 states for Medicaid. And that already was extremely serious. But what became clear, and what I wrote about in my Monday article after that Friday, is that was in some sense kind of the OK situation. Because even those 50 state payment portals that went down for a day, they went down because either Health and Human Services could just shut down the portal while they figured out how to comply with the executive orders temporarily, or they directed the bureau, the fiscal service to do it. They didn't just do it from one central point. It was agencies in a confusion figuring out how they could comply and a court can issue a court order and the people at Health and Human Services can choose to follow the court order, follow the law over just what the Trump administration says. You know, in a constitutional crisis, this is the typical thing. You are fighting what I've called bureaucratic trench warfare, agency to agency.\n\nAnd that's why they're sending all these people to physically take over the buildings, to shut off people's emails, all that stuff. And that stuff is hard. It's a pain. It's annoying to have to actually go to try to take control of the federal government. It would be a lot easier if you could just flip a switch and it doesn't matter what those people are doing. And hey, maybe we can flip a switch and get those people to stop being paid. And with those people stop being paid, then they're going to have to quit and go somewhere else. Because they have to live. And it'll be a lot easier to take over the federal government that way. And that is what they were trying to do. You know, what I've called the payments heart of the federal government is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. And they were trying to grab ahold of the payments heart and shut things down. And it seems like for now they are respecting court injunctions. But, you know, for example, the federal judiciary is paid through the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Hypothetically, they could just shut down the federal judiciary from getting paid. And then what happens from there? No expert has an answer for you about what happens from there.\n\nKrugman: Yeah. Okay, we could go further, but I think I want to touch on one last subject, which is the risk of kind of a crack up. You've been talking about that quite a lot. I'll give you my version and then tell me what I've got wrong.\n\nThe Federal government isn’t all slick, state-of-the-art computers and hyper-sophisticated. It's legacy systems and old software, and it's held together with scotch tape and rubber bands. And then you get a bunch of people who weren't born when these things were put in place, and there's a real risk that payment systems just sort of collapse. Have I got that right, kind of?\n\nTankus: Yeah, there is that risk. I think we're past that risk. I think the reaction was dramatic enough. Wired's reporting, my reporting, Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo's reporting, and sort of just a wider outrage, the lawsuits. I think they didn't know what they were playing with, and then they really were kind of taken aback by the strong reaction. And I think they're backing away from that.\n\nKrugman: That's good.\n\nTankus: But in a certain sense, saying ‘OK, the payment system isn't just going to break because Marko Elez decided to hit the wrong button’ is kind of papering over the fact that this constitutional crisis is still extraordinarily serious. And they got even much further quicker than I thought they would be able to. Things are kind of hanging by a thread with them continuing to respect court injunctions. And of course, on an hour to hour basis, on a day to day basis, we don't know how much or whether they're still respecting the court injunctions. And I just hope, I'm really hoping that my sources reach out or more sources reach out if that situation changes.\n\nKrugman: OK, that's slightly, slightly reassuring that at least the immediate risk that some 19-year-old misspells a line of code and Fedwire goes down or something. Does Fedwire still exist? I'm probably showing my age.\n\nTankus: Yes, Fedwire still exists. There's the small, medium-sized payment to the ACH, and then there's Fedwire.\n\nKrugman: Okay, but that the mechanism essentially for doing what you describe, which is just plain cutting off spending on things that, not even necessarily things they don't like, but things that based upon their identifying code might be things they don't like, that that is still there, that there have been court injunctions, but we don't know, and we might not know. How would we? What would be the early warning signs that something really major is happening?\n\nTankus: The early warning signs—and this kind of is really getting into the weeds. You can kind of think of this in a basic way. The Treasury's sending out payments. And so if the Treasury's sending out payments, someone's receiving those payments. And ultimately, if you are getting a social security check, your bank also is getting a payment, and then it follows on and credits your account. Their account is also credited. So there's more of these balances. We can call them settlement balances, or the typical term is reserves, and more of those are sloshing around the banking system. If those payments aren't going out, then they're not sloshing around the banking system. And so every day, banks have access to what are called daylight overdrafts, which is just a fancy way of saying, you can borrow money for 12 hours until, 5 PM or 6 PM that night, or whatever it is. And you know, according to my reporting, talking to former high level Federal Reserve or Treasury officials, our kind of group consensus is that these daylight overdrafts across the banking system would go up a lot. And the issue is, we don't have that data. It’s not reported on an everyday basis. So essentially, I'm hoping, you know, some people are keeping an eye on that, whether they're at the Fed, whether they're banks that notice their own daylight overdrafts going up a lot or even just saying, ‘hey, we've gotten a lot less government ACH payments than we usually do. And someone leaks that information to me or a reporter.\n\nKrugman: Yeah, I was actually wondering who they'd leak it to if not you. I mean, if you get hit by a truck, how do we know if this has happened?\n\nTankus: Well, I'll put this pitch out there. If someone out there who's watching this or reading the transcript wants to put up a budget, $500,000 or a million to train up people and, you know, make me replaceable, I'm more than eager to train up my redundancies. [email me at Crisesnotes@gmail.com or contact me on signal at NathanTankus.01]\n\nKrugman: This will be in the transcript. That's actually, it is scary.\n\nNathan Tankus:\n\nBut I do want to say on that, to your point, I had read your piece about leaving the New York Times. And when I read your piece, and that was before all this broke out, I found reading your piece kind of alarming. Because as you say, newspapers don't really have someone with chops who can know how to read a government report and putting it out there. And you're interviewing me. The stuff I'm talking about is so technical and abstruse and is not something that you can catch on to.\n\nKrugman: There's a kind of middle ground. I'm probably going to be talking about this with some other people as well. There’s straight ‘a man bit a dog on Fifth Avenue’ reporting, which still needs to be done. And then there's the, ‘I was having dinner with some friends and they all said…,’ and the middle ground is analysis, which inevitably has to have a point of view. I'm not sure it was ever really there, but we really need it now and they don't have it. Well, this is not about me. But…\n\nTankus: Well, but it's important because, you know, there's a reason that I'm doing this interview and it's not just because, it's going to be great to have Paul Krugman, you know, a Nobel Memorial Prize winner interview. Obviously, you know, that's meaningful and significant career-wise. But you're exactly the kind of person who serves that role of taking content from what I do and making it even more accessible. And it would be nice if this was, say, in the New York Times or the Washington Post rather than in your own personal newsletter.\n\nKrugman:\n\nWell, newsletters are becoming really critical. Have you read Henry Farrell and Abe Newman's book, Underground Empire? if you haven't then you should. They talk a lot about how much hidden power the United States has because of its control of things like, above all, the global banking system and its ability to disrupt payments when it chooses. And their latest update is, now we're doing it to ourselves. Some pretty amazing stuff.\n\nTankus: Yeah, I think that's absolutely true. I do want to plug that one of the reasons why I was so sensitive to this issue and able to kind of quickly jump on it is that my colleague, a law professor at Willamette University, Rohan Grey, had actually written a draft of a law review article all about making the federal government's internal payment system secure using our updated technologies, what are typically associated with what is now called central bank digital currency. But central banking is not really the essential place we need this. We need this in the Treasury. We need a Treasury issued digital fiat currency. And one of the essential really important things it would do is you could put a secure server in every agency. And so they could send payments directly out to people's wallets that would then get onto the whole banking system without having one bottleneck, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service or the Federal Reserve that could choke off payments and not be able to get payments out of there. And that seemed frankly like an obscure, abstruse idea. Like, OK, maybe that’s a good idea. And now it's one of the most important discussions about a reform proposal if we get out of this. And so I do want to plug that Rohan is fixing up that paper to put it out for late submission, this law review cycle. And I think it's a very important piece to get published.\n\nKrugman: Have him send me a working paper version. I may not be able to understand it all but I usually think I know what actual expertise looks like even if I don't have it myself so…\n\nOkay, this has been fascinating, mostly terrifying, though I guess the shutting down tomorrow by accident appears to be at least somewhat receded. But wow. Thank you so much for talking with me and we'll get this up for the public quite soon. Thanks so much.\n\nTankus: Absolutely. Yeah, thank you.","html":"<p><strong>Notes on the Crises pivoted on February 1st into around the clock coverage of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025.

This is the latest in my series of videos. I thought it would be really interesting to talk to Nathan Tankus, who has ended up playing a really remarkable role in helping to at least make us aware of and possibly take some precautions against what looks like a kind of digital takeover by Elon Musk's people. And we'll get into all of that. But I first want to ask, Nathan, if you could talk a little bit about your background and how you came to be in this position. As I understand it, you're kind of a financial plumbing expert, if we could say that. Would that be a fair description?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah, absolutely.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Were you at the Fed or at the Treasury?</p><p><strong>Tankus: </strong>No, I'm a pure outsider.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: An outsider but you've paid a lot of attention to what they do. We think that management says ‘send money there’ and it just happens but it's actually a very elaborate process, right?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Absolutely. You asked about my background, how I came to this. So I feel like that's an opportunity to go way back in my history. And for me, this all started in January 2009. I'm 33 so in January 2009 I was still in high school and I went to a kind of <a href=\"https://www.friendsofurban.org/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>small alternative public high school called Urban Academy</u></a> and I had two teachers who just taught a class called Show Me the Money where we read selections of the newspaper each week. We read, I don't know, probably a dozen Paul Krugman blog posts or columns and I started reading your blog every day, among a whole bunch of other blogs, and I just became obsessed. So I'm one of these people who was really kind of woken up by the Great Financial Crisis and it captured their imagination and just rolled with that. I've kind of bounced around a lot of different things since then, but in meantime, picked up a lot of knowledge where I got to the point where I was actually asking such kind of interesting detailed questions where people, even former treasury or federal reserve people, would be willing to talk to me because I was asking the kind of questions that no one else was asking. And so that 15 year journey, which involved, like, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-02/nathan-tankus-s-newsletter-subscribers-don-t-care-about-diplomas?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>a big success during the beginning of coronavirus</u></a>, has kind of brought me to this place, this unique position to be able to write about these kinds of things.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Just tell me what was the success with coronavirus?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: I started my newsletter Notes on the Crises on March 19th, 2020, because it was clear to me that there was going to be a lot of economic impacts. There already were at that point, but there were going to be a lot more and they weren't very well understood. And anyone who had any sort of expertise or knowledge with what the Federal Reserve was doing, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-reserves-coronavirus-468/\"><u>what were called “crisis facilities,”</u></a> where they launched these suites of programs that were going to support the financial system, support municipalities, state and local government, support the corporate sector, and that anyone who had detailed knowledge of those programs was either in government, at a think tank (and thus had to be doing all sorts of things assigned by their bosses), a journalist who was too busy covering the big picture stuff to get into the details, or was a professor who was trying to figure out how to teach on Zoom suddenly in the middle of a semester. And so I had a unique opportunity as someone who was kind of a total outsider, did not have a nine to five job that made me commit to doing some other set of activities. So I could just devote all my time to writing about it. That first four months, I wrote a piece every other day, including weekends on average. Just, you know, that first month I put out 21 pieces and that sort of big rush is what made my career. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-02/nathan-tankus-s-newsletter-subscribers-don-t-care-about-diplomas?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Bloomberg Business Week did a profile on me</u></a>. So in a strange way, I've kind of already had this experience that I've been having for the past month, but obviously this month has been much more intense and much more dramatic.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: OK, we stepped up to help people through this—what I was calling a ‘medically induced coma for the economy’ during Covid. But that involved trying to get money out in unusual, unprecedented ways and presumably was technically very demanding. And you were writing about that then.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Absolutely. I was largely <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-reserves-coronavirus-468/\"><u>focused on the Federal Reserve</u></a>, but I had interest in other things, including state unemployment insurance and actually how, as we'll get to in a bit, related to this, how their COBOL systems made updating them very technically complex. So for example, why the unemployment insurance checks were an additional $600 a week, rather than say, “We're going to replace 80% of your income.” It was just too technically complicated in the time available to program 80% or replacement rates. And so they just slapped on adding $600 a week to everyone's check because that was technically easier.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: That's interesting. I knew that the number 600 was based on average earnings. But I didn't think about why it was a fixed number... But yeah, I do remember the state of New Jersey, which is where I was at the time, putting out a desperate appeal for people who knew how to program in COBOL. Because basically nobody knows how to do that anymore.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah. I desperately tried to get my dad to take up New Jersey's call, but he had just retired December 2019 and he had no interest whatsoever.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: So you were looking at the Fed's efforts. I know that obviously the Fed has to have been doing extraordinary stuff to maintain liquidity, but I wasn't really paying attention to that side of it. Just a word or two, maybe too technical for a lot of people, but just what were they doing that was especially unusual and difficult?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: The vast majority of the programs that they launched were similar to <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-reserves-coronavirus/\"><u>programs that they had launched in 2008</u></a> in response to the great financial crisis. And so these were a suite of programs that were designed to do what worked in normal times: preserve liquidity to the banking system and wider financial markets. Normally you just rely on financial market participants to do that and the Fed is operating quietly in the background as a backstop, and they had to take on that explicitly. So, normally you provide liquidity to the banking system. The banking system makes sure that wider financial market participants have liquidity. They make sure that say, you know, corporate bonds are liquid and that, you know, corporations can borrow at a pretty reasonable rate or rather a rate that is in line with the Fed's broader monetary policy. But all of the sort of creaking conditions of financial markets breaking down in response to the disruptions expected by COVID meant that what the Fed usually does implicitly, it felt like it had to do explicitly. So it launched a primary corporate credit market facility and a secondary corporate credit market facility, which is really just a fancy way of saying they directly lent to corporations or they bought corporate debt off of financial market participants who had this corporate debt, or anyone who really needed to sell it. And they launched those kind of programs for state and local governments all across the board.</p><p>They just made sure that anyone who needed liquidity essentially had it and that if things were going to break down, they were going to break down by COVID's direct effects and not by not being able to borrow money.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: For listeners, I know a little bit, but only a little bit about this. In normal times, certainly the way that textbooks teach it, the Fed buys treasury bills from banks. That's how the Fed gets money out into the economy, which is straightforward. But when everything is breaking down, they can't count on the money actually getting out there to where it's needed. I knew people who worked on their commercial paper facility in 2009, which was basically, roughly speaking, small business lending. Normally the Fed would just put money into the banks and expect it to find its way, but the market wasn't working. So the Fed was doing this on a much wider scale. And you were tracking how they were actually doing this, so, paying attention to the specific programs.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Absolutely. I wrote <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-reserves-coronavirus-468/\"><u>this big seven part series on all the details where</u></a>, literally, I went through every press release that the Federal Reserve released since the beginning of February, 2020, and just tried to provide a simple-as-possible explanation of every single press release. And that kind of comprehensive detailed painstaking work got a lot of attention.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: That's really interesting. Last week I did a conversation with Jim Chanos, the famous short seller, and he would base his research, not on having spies, but on actually just taking stuff that was in the public domain, but actually reading it. It sounds like that's what you were doing.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Absolutely. That is definitely the kind of approach that I've developed to understanding things. And I've kind of reached the point of reading whatever's in the public domain in detail enough that people want to talk to me. I've now reached the point where I've read so much of that stuff that the bankers and former Fed and Treasury and maybe current people want to talk to me.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Okay. Is there something else you want to tell us about the background before we move up to the current crisis?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: I think that is it. I think the one thing I would say is, I'm known as a Federal Reserve person because I did that big thing during coronavirus. I'm known as a Fed person. And so to some people, it's a little strange getting into what we're going to talk about, where it seems kind of the Fed's there, but it's in the background. It's a side detail in this story, which maybe will unfortunately become more important in the coming months. And so people are kind of like, well, what is this? And I kind of have a general interest in payment systems, in the monetary system, in the financial system, how Congress's budgetary process works, you know, kind of all of these things in all of their complex interrelations. And that's a lot of what my colleagues and I do at the Modern Money Network, where I'm a research director.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Okay. You were doing the Fed back then, but Treasury also has a part. Obviously, there's a lot of plumbing involved. If the Secretary of the Treasury says issue checks to a bunch of people and Treasury Secretary says ‘make it so,’ what I hadn't realized was there is basically an agency, an office, there's a particular relatively small unit in Treasury that makes that happen. What's that? A bureau. The bureau of the treasury, which is actually kind of what for normal, inaccurate language, kind of cuts the checks, right? Is that a fair description?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Absolutely. That's a fair description, Paul.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: And their normal role is simple. They don't verify whether something is a good policy. That's not their job. They don't verify whether the people are deserving. They just sort of verify whether this has been authorized. Is that right?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah, that's exactly correct. You can kind of think about it with your bank. If you write a check and say, ‘I've got to pay this bill, I've got to pay my utility bill,’ maybe they can tell from the name of the company that it's your utility company. But they don't say, ‘hey, what type of thing are you spending on? Is this for alcohol? I don't think that is good for you. We're going to have this check bounce. You're going to have to pay a whole bunch of fees because you're not supposed to be buying that.’ That's exactly what we generally don't want a payment system to do. We don't want there to be like a Payments Big Brother that tells us ‘you can have this, but you can't have that.’ The example I used in one of my articles is, conservatives don't want there to be some liberal person in the payment system limiting how much meat you can buy in a month.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: If you are using a debit card, they do have fraud algorithms, departments, that will flag a transaction as looking like the kind of thing you usually don’t buy or doesn't look like your spending. So I'll get a text and say, ‘respond yes or no,’ which is, I guess, a protection. But anyway, there may be a little bit of that going on here as well but basically, ‘does it look like a properly authorized payment,’ right?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah, that's a great example, actually, because, you know, we'll get into more of the details in a second of the various other systems. But when this bureau, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, sends out payments, it doesn't just actually [just] send out a payment. It checks a payment. It does a final check. You know, there's supposed to be other processes that check, but they do a last check against a system which is <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-asked-former-bureau-of-the-fiscal-service-employees-to-interpret-an-elon-musk-tweet/\"><u>called officially the Do Not Pay system</u></a>. And there's various parts of this system which flags if, you know, ‘is the person getting this check dead,’ that kind of thing. But, if you get flagged by Do Not Pay, they don't then say, ‘Well, alright, this payment's not going out.’ All that is just a check, and then they send it back to the agency. The same way that you get that text message that says, ‘hey, did you really mean to make this payment?’ They send it back to the agency and say, ‘hey, did you really mean to make this payment?’ Or maybe there's an issue with this payment. ‘Look further into it.’ But if the agency comes back and goes, ‘Hey. No, this payment is legit. Send this payment.’ They're not going to overrule them. And so this system <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/i-asked-former-bureau-of-the-fiscal-service-employees-to-interpret-an-elon-musk-tweet/\"><u>does it in a more complicated way but does the same thing as your bank</u></a>, saying, ‘hey, did you really mean to make that debit card transaction?’</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Okay. And by the way, sometimes it works, you know? There was somebody ordering basically from the equivalent of Uber Eats, but in Britain and was ordering Indian food in a suburb of London on my card. That was not me.</p><p>But, okay, how big is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service? How many people are we talking about roughly? It's quite tiny, right?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: I don't have the employment right off the top of my head, but I would guess, like, let's call it 2,000 - 3,000 people [Editorial note, I was close. They had nearly 2000 “Full Time Equivalent” employees <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/17.-Fiscal-FY-2021-BIB.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>in Fiscal Year 2020 &amp; 2021</u></a> and <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/14.-BFS-FY-2025-BIB.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>1826 in Fiscal Year 2024</u></a>] and it handles around $5 trillion of payments.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: So this is really quite a small agency, but its job is not to decide what's a good payment. Okay, so you became aware that some of Elon Musk's people were getting access to this Bureau. Tell me what was... it was actually just news stories, right? So, what did Nathan Tankus know and how did he know it?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Friday, January 31st, I had just put <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>out a big piece about how we already were in a constitutional crisis</u></a>. I described a five alarm fire constitutional crisis. There had just been this implementation memo from the Office of Management and Budget directing a sweeping freezing of spending across the federal government until the Trump administration could review it. This caused immediate chaos. The Medicaid portals to send payments out through Medicaid went down. This had caused such an immediate disruption that they had to rescind the memo, but they hadn't rescinded the executive orders that were driving this memo. And so I wrote a long piece about why this is a big deal. Why, what's called impoundment, which is not spending what Congress directs or <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>appropriates to be spent, is a big deal</u></a>, why it's a constitutional crisis, why it is like a fundamental demotion of Congress's role in our constitutional system. So I was already focused on this issue and I was already pretty concerned.</p><p>You know, my newsletter is called Notes on the Crises. So, I'm paying attention to crisis. Crisis is, you know, when people are really reading my articles and when you're really getting a lot of them, that's when you know something's really, really wrong, you know? So I was already focused on this. And <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/31/elon-musk-treasury-department-payment-systems/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>in an article in the Washington Post I had seen a headline</u></a> about how a high level person in the Treasury had resigned in protest or is on leave or something, but related to the treasury's payment system. And as a payments expert, that headline was incredibly alarming. So alarming, in fact, that I put it aside and I couldn't get myself to read it for a few hours. I had gotten caught up with promoting my piece that day, so I hadn't eaten that day. So I was like, ‘I'm gonna go get something to eat.’</p><p>And my friend, colleague, t<a href=\"https://stephaniekelton.substack.com/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>he economist Stephanie Kelton at Stony Brook</u></a>, when I told her that, she had already read the article and was already alarmed. She said, ‘I don't think that's the right order.’ But nevertheless, I hadn't eaten that day. So I went to go eat, and then I went to go read it. I mean, literally, four paragraphs into this article,<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u> I had a panic attack</u></a>. It was possibly the scariest or one of the scariest moments of my life when I read that article. And it was so scary to me because what the article said was that the Fiscal Assistant Secretary, who's the highest civil servant in the treasury, where everyone above him are political appointees. You know, there's that top layer of every agency which are political appointees that, you might fire the old people, you fire the Biden administration or the Trump people, and you bring in your people. That’s a normal expected part of government. But everyone below them are supposed to be professional civil servants who were doing the job regardless of the partisan status of the executive branch, regardless of who is president. And the fact that this person had been pushed out because DOGE and Elon Musk in the Department of Government Efficiency <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>were asking to have access to the Treasury and this guy</u></a>, a long time official, someone who'd been in the government since 1989, had been in this highest status position since 10 years ago had been widely credited as the person who has expertly managed the treasury and payments throughout the various debt ceiling crises where you're trying to squeeze every dollar and make sure payments go out without breaching the debt ceiling. I immediately understood how desperately serious and what the worst case scenarios could be and was overwhelmed by it. And I was also overwhelmed and alarmed as an expert in this area that so few people understood how serious this was that it was, and that it was going to be, that it's not just that this was so dangerous, but that there was very few people who were in a position to really say anything about this. And to be frank, my newsletter is called Notes on the Crises. I have 50,000 people on my email list, some already very high-powered, powerful people who—I'm not going to name names—but I know that they're there. And it might seem a little strange, absent context, but I knew immediately that this was basically up to me.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Right.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>:</p><p>So, you know, more or less, to get the word out there and to race against the clock of whatever DOGE was gonna do and before they actually could get in there, you know? And so taking the opportunity of what I hoped gave me the weekend, like literally just the time of the weekend, hopefully the DOGE kids were going out, you know, doing drugs somewhere else and not actually at the Treasury, and take that opportunity to write as fast as I could, research as fast as I could to have a piece out Monday morning. I <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>successfully accomplished that</u></a>. I also managed to concurrently have a <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-elon-musk-treasury-payment-system-dangerous-1235254831?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>simpler version of my piece run in Rolling Stone</u></a> at the same time and, you know, then hit the ground running, made sure to get a haircut Sunday night, had the, you know, brain space to do that because I knew I was going to be doing video interviews the next day.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Just to be clear, impoundment is like the director of the Office of Small Animals gets a memo saying no money for rabbits, even though Congress has allocated it. But this is some guy, some 19-year-old or whatever from DOGE gets into the computers and possibly, and we need to talk about this, possibly alters the code so that no money goes out for rabbits or possibly just doesn't know what the hell he's doing and just crashes the system. Is that a fair characterization?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Exactly. There's <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-six-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025/\"><u>one person in Marko Elez</u></a>, a 25 year old who used to work at SpaceX. He's, you know—as we'll get to—he's out of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service now, but he's just been sent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/doge-staffer-behind-racist-posts-reappears-at-social-security?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>over to the Social Security Administration.</u></a></p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Which is wonderful. I'm actually getting checks from the SSA myself now, although it's not important for me, but it's absolutely critical for like 80% of people my age. Before we get a little nonlinear here, but kids. Elez would be like almost the oldest of this team, right? These were real kids. And I've been seeing some theorizing about why are we getting really such young people with often with very questionable things in their backgrounds. What's your take on that? And I'll give you the one I've heard from other people.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: So it's not something I've looked into a ton, but my impression is these are people who adore Elon Musk, are very personally loyal to him, are willing to do some very unusual things because they do not have a professional background. ‘This is cool and awesome and the internet and, you know, I'm a Reddit kid who gets to screw with the federal government in real life.’ I also think these kids are expendable. And also, I think the fact that these kids are kind of racist kids from chat lines who tweet like Marko Elez did to ‘normalize Indian hate’, these things are useful because it means that if things get too hot there's a reason you can get rid of one of these kids. You can cite racist posts which, as we'll get into, is <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-eleven-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-marko-elezs-resignation-return-and-irrelevance/\"><u>what happened with Marko Elez</u></a> even though that's not actually why they're getting kicked out of the government, and so it's a perfect shield to make sure that there's as much confusion and obfuscation about just how serious what Musk is doing on behalf of the Trump administration.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Yeah, that's not too different. The theory that I heard, Josh Marshall (TalkingPointsMemo.com), has a post on all that, and has said that these guys are being asked to do things that are quite likely illegal and that if you're a 35 year old experienced guy with a background and a career, you could blow up your life. But these are twenty-something-at-most guys who don't have that, who don't themselves have much to lose.</p><p><strong>Tankus:</strong></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Krugman:</strong></p><p>I don't know if you've seen it, but there's this point in <em>Oppenheimer</em> where’s he’s dealing with General Groves, who pretends to be a dumb general, but is actually not. And he suddenly realizes, ‘you didn't hire me despite my communist connections. You hired me because of them, because that means that you can get rid of me whenever you want.’ Ok, so these kids come in. And what are they doing?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>:</p><p>Well, first I would just say overwhelmingly, we don't really know. I mean, the full scope of what these people are doing is not very clear. It's, of course, under very unclear authority, likely illegal in so many cases. And so the most dangerous thing is just how little we know. In this case<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>, with Marko Elez getting</u></a> in there, it seems to be downloading data. For a time, I had sources right in the Bureau of the Fiscal Service office or building where he was bouncing around looking at all these very sensitive systems and my sources <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>could see him download data</u></a>. But the systems are so sensitive that even senior IT people in these places could see that Marko Elez was downloading data but couldn't see what the data was because these systems are so sensitive, even they don't have access to them.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Okay, this downloaded data could be personal information, could be business information, it could be, I mean, the federal government has, you know, as you say, five trillion in spending, so it's got fingers in all kinds of areas, it has information on all kinds of things, so this could be just downloading information that could be used to Elon Musk's business advantage, could be used in various ways to pressure people. So one possibility was simply that they were getting access to data that is supposed to be very carefully protected. As you say, even senior people don't have that kind of access. There was also the question about whether he or some other people were able to—and I understand it's not that clear a distinction—but were able to actually rewrite some of the code. Can you explain to me what we're all talking about there and what the concerns are?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah, so this is still kind of shrouded in confusion. There should be an independent investigation of what exactly Marko Elez was doing. For a time the Fiscal Service people seemed to be investigating and were very upset about him bouncing around after he was out and were literally treating it like it was a cyber security incident, like it was. Like they had been hacked because in a certain sense they had been. But obviously, the pressure from high up, from Treasury Secretary Bessent kind of squashed that. Even a subcontractor from Booz Allen, who wrote a memo about the cyber security risks, the huge cyber security risk, the dangers of having Marko Elez around, was fired for writing that report. Now there's a court case where people have been testifying under oath about what was going on. So it's still not exactly clear what is happening.</p><p>What I would emphasize about this, like literally Marko Elez rewriting the code, is in a certain sense, you know, this was important, it was dramatic, it was something <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>that both Wired and I were breaking stories about</u></a> that was bringing attention and seriousness to it. But at a larger policy level, that kind of thing is kind of a sideshow. I followed along with it to keep attention on the story and to keep the pressure on, but the policy conclusion from my point of view was the same regardless of any of the stories that I broke or not. Because the point of looking at data, even if you only have read access where you can look at the data, is to propose changes. The purpose of even just gaining enough control where you can tell the civil service people what to do, even if they're the ones actually looking at the code, is to get them to do things. <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>One explosive court filing</u></a> is that already by the time that I had come to find out about this on January 31st, they had been at the payments level of blocking payments, which, what I mean is there's literally these payment files written basically the same way they would be written in the 1970s that get processed through these systems and get sent on to the Federal Reserve to be processed by ACH, Automated Clearing House, which is how any sort of small or medium-sized value payment works. You get a payment from Social Security and it's a direct deposit to your account, it is an ACH payment. That's the system.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>And they were literally just taking</u></a> the files and going, ‘we're not handing those over. We're not processing this because we're shutting down USAID.’ And as we know, they've now taken over the building and shut down USAID, but they were also doing that at the payments level. And <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/how-can-we-know-if-government-payments-stop-an-exploratory-analysis-of-banking-system-warning-signs/\"><u>so with the Hamilton Projects tracker</u></a>, you can see the payments from USAID go to zero, literally zero January 28th. So they were literally doing this. [nuanced correction of these statements from <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/mini-roundup-nuanced-correction-of-krugman-interview-two-columbia-law-professors-in-the-u-of-chicago-law-review-on-my-foia-project-attending-bloomberg-invest/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">03/04/2025 can be found here</a>]</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: So that's before they actually seized the building and told everybody to go home. They actually just stopped the payments. Wow. So I was going to offer a hypothetical, but I don't need to. That's an actual case. They just sort of made the judgment, decided we don't like USAID and without even telling the officials at USAID to stop paying the money or before we get around to that, we just tell the computer to stop making the payments.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Exactly. And there is an even further incident that the court filings reveal that I reported on last week [<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>two weeks ago</u></a>] that really flagged the importance that no one had really caught, something even more dramatic and eye opening. Something I would have felt would be too out there for me to have speculated on when I was writing about the worst case scenarios. They had been using these payment codes, what are called treasury account symbols, which is complicated, but basically what it means is you're associating a specific type of payment with a specific type of appropriations, the type of legislation from Congress that authorizes spending. And they figured out what codes related to money for refugees. And <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>they flagged three payments, three appropriations for three payment files related to refugees</u></a>, funding the administrative expenses of programs to bring literally refugee aid to women and children in other countries, and then a couple others of a similar tenor, and flagged them.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Wow.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Which, you know, sounds technical. But to me, what’s extremely dramatic, is that this spending was not USAID spending. This spending was <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>Health and Human Services Department spending</u></a>. And so they flagged the payments, the payment files, and sent them back to review. But they did not send them back to Health and Human Services. They've sent them to the State Department for the State Department to look over whether they were consistent with Trump's executive orders. So to really break that down, they were talking to one agency, which maybe they feel like they've already gotten their favorite people in there. ‘You look over and tell us whether we should stop these payments and completely cut out the agency that that spending is, the agency that sent the payment files over.’ So they were already going so far as basically just, ‘we're gonna have essentially our favorite people look and pick and choose what type of appropriations, what type of specific type of spending is gonna go out.’ Now, that spending ultimately did go out according to court documents, but this happened even faster than I thought it had or could have when I was writing about this at the beginning when I was already very, very alarmed about what was going on. And now there are court injunctions against all this stuff, but who knows really where this goes.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Okay, and so this is impoundment of anything that, you know, looks like DEI to these guys or whatever. I'm told that even in the military, people who are doing things like transnational cooperation have been renaming it because they're afraid that the word trans will be flagged. But this is whole categories of spending, and it's not even a person who has to say stop it or at some point it has to be reviewed but they're just mucking with the file and stopping payments and no attention to what legislation may say or whatever. That's amazing.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah, it's truly remarkable. And I really want to emphasize how dramatic this is. I talked <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>about how I wrote about impoundment</u></a>, what I've been calling ‘part zero’ on January 31st, and talked about the huge disruption of, say, payment portals going down in all 50 states for Medicaid. And that already was extremely serious. But what became clear, and <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>what I wrote about in my Monday article after that Friday</u></a>, is that was in some sense kind of the OK situation. Because even those 50 state payment portals that went down for a day, they went down because either Health and Human Services could just shut down the portal while they figured out how to comply with the executive orders temporarily, or they directed the bureau, the fiscal service to do it. They didn't just do it from one central point. It was agencies in a confusion figuring out how they could comply and a court can issue a court order and the people at Health and Human Services can choose to follow the court order, follow the law over just what the Trump administration says. You know, in a constitutional crisis, this is the typical thing. You are fighting what I've called bureaucratic trench warfare, agency to agency.</p><p>And that's why they're sending all these people to physically take over the buildings, to shut off people's emails, all that stuff. And that stuff is hard. It's a pain. It's annoying to have to actually go to try to take control of the federal government. It would be a lot easier if you could just flip a switch and it doesn't matter what those people are doing. And hey, maybe we can flip a switch and get those people to stop being paid. And with those people stop being paid, then they're going to have to quit and go somewhere else. Because they have to live. And it'll be a lot easier to take over the federal government that way. And that is what they were trying to do. You know, what I've called the payments heart of the federal government is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. And they were trying to grab ahold of the payments heart and shut things down. And it seems like for now they are respecting court injunctions. But, you know, for example, the federal judiciary is paid through the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Hypothetically, they could just shut down the federal judiciary from getting paid. And then what happens from there? No expert has an answer for you about what happens from there.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Yeah. Okay, we could go further, but I think I want to touch on one last subject, which is the risk of kind of a crack up. You've been talking about that quite a lot. I'll give you my version and then tell me what I've got wrong.</p><p>The Federal government isn’t all slick, state-of-the-art computers and hyper-sophisticated. It's legacy systems and old software, and it's held together with scotch tape and rubber bands. And then you get a bunch of people who weren't born when these things were put in place, and there's a real risk that payment systems just sort of collapse. Have I got that right, kind of?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah, there is that risk. I think we're past that risk. I think the reaction was dramatic enough. <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/bombshell-court-filings-confirm-wired-notes-on-the-crises-reporting-raise-alarms-about-bfs-based-impoundment/\"><u>Wired's reporting, my reporting, Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo's reporting</u></a>, and sort of just a wider outrage, the lawsuits. I think they didn't know what they were playing with, and then they really were kind of taken aback by the strong reaction. And I think they're backing away from that.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: That's good.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: But in a certain sense, saying ‘OK, the payment system isn't just going to break because Marko Elez decided to hit the wrong button’ is kind of papering over the fact that this constitutional crisis is still extraordinarily serious. And they got even much further quicker than I thought they would be able to. Things are kind of hanging by a thread with them continuing to respect court injunctions. And of course, on an hour to hour basis, on a day to day basis, we don't know how much or whether they're still respecting the court injunctions. And I just hope, I'm really hoping that my sources reach out or more sources reach out if that situation changes.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: OK, that's slightly, slightly reassuring that at least the immediate risk that some 19-year-old misspells a line of code and Fedwire goes down or something. Does Fedwire still exist? I'm probably showing my age.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yes, Fedwire still exists. There's the small, medium-sized payment to the ACH, and then there's Fedwire.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Okay, but that the mechanism essentially for doing what you describe, which is just plain cutting off spending on things that, not even necessarily things they don't like, but things that based upon their identifying code might be things they don't like, that that is still there, that there have been court injunctions, but we don't know, and we might not know. How would we? What would be the early warning signs that something really major is happening?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: The early warning signs—and <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/how-can-we-know-if-government-payments-stop-an-exploratory-analysis-of-banking-system-warning-signs/\"><u>this kind of is really getting into the weeds</u></a>. You can kind of think of this in a basic way. The Treasury's sending out payments. And so if the Treasury's sending out payments, someone's receiving those payments. And ultimately, if you are getting a social security check, your bank also is getting a payment, and then it follows on and credits your account. Their account is also credited. So there's more of these balances. We can call them settlement balances, or the typical term is reserves, and more of those are sloshing around the banking system. If those payments aren't going out, then they're not sloshing around the banking system. And so every day, banks have access to <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/how-can-we-know-if-government-payments-stop-an-exploratory-analysis-of-banking-system-warning-signs/\"><u>what are called daylight overdrafts</u></a>, which is just a fancy way of saying, you can borrow money for 12 hours until, 5 PM or 6 PM that night, or whatever it is. And you know, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/how-can-we-know-if-government-payments-stop-an-exploratory-analysis-of-banking-system-warning-signs/\"><u>according to my reporting</u></a>, talking to former high level Federal Reserve or Treasury officials, our kind of group consensus is that these daylight overdrafts across the banking system would go up a lot. And the issue is, we don't have that data. It’s not reported on an everyday basis. So essentially, I'm hoping, you know, some people are keeping an eye on that, whether they're at the Fed, whether they're banks that notice their own daylight overdrafts going up a lot or even just saying, ‘hey, we've gotten a lot less government ACH payments than we usually do. And someone leaks that information to me or a reporter.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Yeah, I was actually wondering who they'd leak it to if not you. I mean, if you get hit by a truck, how do we know if this has happened?</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Well, I'll put this pitch out there. If someone out there who's watching this or reading the transcript wants to put up a budget, $500,000 or a million to train up people and, you know, make me replaceable, I'm more than eager to train up my redundancies. [email me at <a href=\"mailto:Crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><u>Crisesnotes@gmail.com</u></a> or contact me on signal at NathanTankus.01]</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: This will be in the transcript. That's actually, it is scary.</p><p><strong>Nathan Tankus:</strong></p><p>But I do want to say on that, to your point, I had read your piece about <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/leaving-the-new-york-times?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>leaving the New York Times</u></a>. And when I read your piece, and that was before all this broke out, I found reading your piece kind of alarming. Because as you say, newspapers don't really have someone with chops who can know how to read a government report and putting it out there. And you're interviewing <em>me</em>. The stuff I'm talking about is so technical and abstruse and is not something that you can catch on to.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: There's a kind of middle ground. I'm probably going to be talking about this with some other people as well. There’s straight ‘<em>a man bit a dog on Fifth Avenue’</em> reporting, which still needs to be done. And then there's the, ‘I was having dinner with some friends and they all said…,’ and the middle ground is analysis, which inevitably has to have a point of view. I'm not sure it was ever really there, but we really need it now and they don't have it. Well, this is not about me. But…</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Well, but it's important because, you know, there's a reason that I'm doing this interview and it's not just because, it's going to be great to have Paul Krugman, you know, a Nobel Memorial Prize winner interview. Obviously, you know, that's meaningful and significant career-wise. But you're exactly the kind of person who serves that role of taking content from what I do and making it even more accessible. And it would be nice if this was, say, in the New York Times or the Washington Post rather than in your own personal newsletter.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>:</p><p>Well, newsletters are becoming really critical. Have you read Henry Farrell and Abe Newman's book, <em>Underground Empire</em>? if you haven't then you should. They talk a lot about how much hidden power the United States has because of its control of things like, above all, the global banking system and its ability to disrupt payments when it chooses. And their latest update is, now we're doing it to ourselves. Some pretty amazing stuff.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Yeah, I think that's absolutely true. I do want to plug that one of the reasons why I was so sensitive to this issue and able to kind of quickly jump on it is that my colleague, <a href=\"https://rohangrey.net/writing/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>a law professor at Willamette University, Rohan Grey</u></a>, had actually written a draft of a law review article all about making the federal government's internal payment system secure using our updated technologies, what are typically associated with what is now called central bank digital currency. But central banking is not really the essential place we need this. We need this in the Treasury. We need a <a href=\"https://rohangrey.net/files/testimony-6-15-21-written.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Treasury issued digital fiat currency</u></a>. And one of the essential really important things it would do is you could put a secure server in every agency. And so they could send payments directly out to people's wallets that would then get onto the whole banking system without having one bottleneck, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service or the Federal Reserve that could choke off payments and not be able to get payments out of there. And that seemed frankly like an obscure, abstruse idea. Like, OK, maybe that’s a good idea. And now it's one of the most important discussions about a reform proposal if we get out of this. And so I do want to plug that Rohan is fixing up that paper to put it out for late submission, this law review cycle. And I think it's a very important piece to get published.</p><p><strong>Krugman</strong>: Have him send me a working paper version. I may not be able to understand it all but I usually think I know what actual expertise looks like even if I don't have it myself so…</p><p>Okay, this has been fascinating, mostly terrifying, though I guess the shutting down tomorrow by accident appears to be at least somewhat receded. But wow. Thank you so much for talking with me and we'll get this up for the public quite soon. Thanks so much.</p><p><strong>Tankus</strong>: Absolutely.

you.</p>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/musk-in-your-computers-paul-krugman-interviews-nathan-tankus/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"d31cc50a-46a4-4e4e-906d-0389cecbfe1d","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"67c346345127c300013aa368","reading_time":31}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"February

There is nothing disastrous about it. I’m sending out this newsletter today to make sure that the people looking for some good news (at least by the standards of the day) can get some now. Our story begins right after we left off: with Marko Elez, the DOGE employee I relentlessly tracked through the bowels of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service using my anonymous sources in my last five pieces, resigning within an hour of my last piece. His resignation was a gigantic relief for me and allowed me to unwind an enormous amount of stress I had built up over the past week. If you listen to my interviews at either the Majority Report, Lever News, Bloomberg’s Odd Lots or radio KPFA last week, I think the stress I felt and the enormous burden that weighed on me is clear even as I was professional and kept to the facts as much as possible.\n\nSubsequent surreal news emerged on this subject (a point I’ll return to), but I was able to keep on resting and the news developed in such a way as to facilitate keeping away from work this weekend. I scrambled to raise the alarm about this issue at the beginning of last week and was successful at doing so while reinforcing my analysis with cutting edge investigative reporting. \n\nThe best I could do on Thursday was update people by updating “Afternoon of Day Seven of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025: Treasury Secretary Bessent’s Lawlessness & Sorry Readers- Read and Write Code Still Seems in Play” with this brief message at the top:\n\nUPDATE 4:21 PM: MARKO ELEZ HAS RESIGNED. WALL STREET JOURNAL CLAIMS IT WAS OVER \"RACIST POSTS\". OBVIOUSLY NOT TRUE- WIRED, TALKING POINTS MEMO AND I GOT HIM. NEED TO REST, MORE TOMORROW\n\nI, of course, did not end up doing a piece on Friday. So let’s unpack my E-telegram here and what I mean. \n\nAt 3:53 PM on Thursday, February 6th the Wall Street Journal published an article by Katherine Long entitled “DOGE Staffer Resigns Over Racist Posts”. Obviously this announcement was met with celebration from me and others, including statements from me about having “gotten” him. This caused confusion with some on social media even crediting me with Katherine Long’s investigative efforts. To be absolutely clear: I did not nor did I ever claim to have found archived racist posts from Marko Elez. What I meant was something entirely different.\n\nIt is very common in business and governmental circles for someone to be fired or “resign” after getting into trouble. It is especially common for the stated reason given to not be the actual reason. This means divining what is actually happening requires a critical and skeptical eye to such news reports. Ask yourself this question: is it believable that the second Trump administration is pushing out employees for racist posts, let alone almost as soon as those racist posts come to light? Recall that Long’s article states “After the Journal inquired about the account, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that Elez had resigned from his role.” Does this pass the “smell test” as a plausible reason for you?\n\nIt is far more likely, though can’t be confirmed as a fact at this stage, that the increasing public pressure based on Wired, Talking Points Memo and my reporting (as well as likely increasing private pressure from former government officials and financial and corporate figures) converged with the reporter getting in touch and created a convenient cover story for Marko Elez’s resignation. Recall that his resignation was official as of sometime Thursday Afternoon which is only 1.5 working days after the release of my Bloomberg Oddlots interview, the first business outlet that truly dramatized the stakes. In governmental terms, that is a split second. Marko Elez was also the subject of a court injunction that very morning which was bad press even if there were potentially dramatic loopholes in that may have even allowed Marco Elez to continue having “read and write” access to source code.\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine that the Op Ed out today by Robert Rubin, Lawrence Summers, Timothy Geithner, Jacob Lew and Janet Yellen “Five Former Treasury Secretaries: Our Democracy Is Under Siege” reflects more varied and heterogeneous efforts last week to intervene in treasury secretary Bessent’s reckless support of DOGE’s despoiling of the Treasury’s payments system. I will also say that their emphasis on the constitutional question involved, something I was extremely early to, seems to betray a familiarity with my work. I also have independent reason to believe this was the case which I cannot divulge.\n\nIn any case, the timing is just too perfect for it to be coincidental. I will admit my immediate reaction the day of was skepticism towards the timing of Katherine Long’s inquiries about those racist tweets. However, it appears that her inquiries were simply fortuitous timing for the Trump administration, and perhaps slightly sped up something that was already in process. In fact, this is something that is actually very useful about the young programmers Elon Musk has hired at DOGE. There is very little doubt that all, or almost all, of these employees have social media histories similar to Marko Elez. This makes it easy to dispose of them while causing confusion about why exactly one of them is being fired, protecting the destructive work they were undertaking. \n\nThen, of course, things got stranger. Elon Musk posted a poll Saturday morning about whether Marko Elez should be “brought back”. A couple of hours later Vice President Vance quote tweeted Musk saying “bring him back”. Musk then quote tweeted Vance’s tweets at 3:13 PM on Friday saying \"He will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine\". The confirmation, however, came when Trump was asked about it at a press conference and said \"Well, I don't know about the particular thing, but if the vice president said that, did you say that? [Vance confirms] I'm with the vice president.\" There is the part of the Trump administration that makes decisions (seemingly led by chief of Staff Susie Wiles) and then there is the part of the Trump administration that makes posts and turns those into decisions. The first part is likely who pushed Marko Elez to resign. The second part is what brought him back.\n\nIt was, however, unclear whether being “rehired” meant back at the United States Treasury. This was crucial because the Thursday injunction only allowed Marko Elez and Thomas Krause “read only’ access, barring any other “special government employees” or outside actors from access to these systems. Further, according to my sources, Krause was not involved in the direct assessment of these systems so with Marko out, it seems that DOGE would be locked out (under, of course, the crucial assumption that they respect the court injunction). The Treasury dodged questions about whether Marko Elez would be rejoining them. These questions became moot early Saturday morning, but we’ll return to that in a moment.\n\nA crucial question is this: when Elez left, how was his activities in the Bureau of the Fiscal Service being treated? I can’t speak to the state of play as of today. However, I can confirm Wired's Friday afternoon article entitled “A US Treasury Threat Intelligence Analysis Designates DOGE Staff as ‘Insider Threat’”. In fact, I posted on bluesky (since I wanted to keep on resting) the confirmation from one of my sources:\n\nBFS is treating Marko's resignation as a cybersecurity breach. The cyber teams are working overtime to analyze the forensic artifacts Marko left behind and determine what he saw/did.\n\nIt is absolutely extraordinary that an employee given top level access, as ordered by the White House, was being treated this way. \n\nSubscribe\n\nAs of this writing it's unclear how long this lasted or whether treating this as a cybersecurity breach was continued informally even as White House and Treasury Secretary Bessent’s pressure intensified. I would like to put off writing about this more until tomorrow for a number of reasons, not least of which we may gain more clarity by the time I sit down to write about it then.\n\nWhat are my sources saying now? I will be unpacking a lot of  the “state of play” with my former Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee sources but my current BFS sources have gone dark. It should be obvious that what they did was risky to their careers and even lives. They had far more on the line than I did and they will never get a fraction of the praise that they deserve. Nor will they get the career benefits I have from being involved in last week’s enormous effort. \n\nI have no way to get back in touch with them of my own volition and the only messages I received from them saved in any form are the ones I got full approval to quote on the record. I do not know my sources names- I corroborated that they worked at BFS in alternative, undisclosed ways- and cannot facilitate their identification even if I wanted to. They will get back in touch if it's safe to do so but if they never do: thank you. I did my best to thank them as much as possible while we talked but nothing can substitute for the flood of gratitude I’ve gotten. \n\nWhich brings me to the final topic I have to tackle today: the latest court injunction. Nineteen state Attorney Generals collectively sued the Trump administration and the Treasury over the Treasury’s treatment of safe and secure data on Sunday night, in a lawsuit now known as “New York et al. v. Trump et al.” I’m proud to say that this lawsuit cites Notes on the Crises. Not only does the lawsuit cite this newsletter, it cites it in an important way:\n\nThe Treasury has represented that DOGE associates have “read only” access— i.e., the ability to view content, but not the ability to modify it. But the true limitations on DOGE’s access remain unclear, and DOGE may still be able to modify the systems in consequential ways [emphasis added]\n\nThe footnote that follows “consequential ways” cites “Day Seven of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025: ‘Yours and WIRED's Reporting is Actually Doing Something’”. Given the importance of this issue I’m especially happy that my writing got cited on such a crucial point.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAt 1 Am Saturday, February 8th, Judge Engelmayer issued an injunction based on the State AG’s lawsuits:\n\nThe Court’s firm assessment is that, for the reasons stated by the States, they will face irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief. See Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking\n\nThe injunction further orders \n\n(i) restrained from granting access to any Treasury Department payment record, payment systems, or any other data systems maintained by the Treasury Department containing personally identifiable information and/or confidential financial information of payees, other than to civil servants with a need for access to perform their job duties within the Bureau of Fiscal Services who have passed all background checks and security clearances and taken all information security training called for in federal statutes and Treasury Department regulations; (ii) restrained from granting access to all political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department, to any Treasury Department payment record, payment systems, or any other data systems maintained by the Treasury Department containing personally identifiable information and/or confidential financial information of payees; and (iii) ordered to direct any person prohibited above from having access to such information, records and systems but who has had access to such information, records, and systems since January 20, 2025, to immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded from the Treasury Department’s records and systems, if any\n\nThus, this injunction is far more comprehensive than Thursday’s injunction. It does not have the “wiggle room” that that injunction has and the Attorney General offices involved seem to have been focused on the difficulty of trying to enforce “middle ground” injunctions like “read only access”. I’m biased of course, but clearly my newsletter contributed something to their effort since they cited it on this very point. I’m sure I’ll be writing a lot more about this injunction in the future and the question of its enforcement. If you have factual information regarding whether this injunction is being violated, please get in contact over Signal (information above).\n\nPart of why this piece took me so long to write today was that there was just so much to cover. In fact, too much. Tomorrow I’ll write about Bessent’s very strange Bloomberg interview last Thursday, The Treasury’s response to the early Saturday court injunction, Musk’s tweeted plans for the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the Booz Allen contractor Treasury fired over his analysis of the Marko-created cybersecurity risks and the so called “black budget” which is apparently processed by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.

There is nothing disastrous about it. I’m sending out this newsletter today to make sure that the people looking for some good news (at least by the standards of the day) can get some now. Our story begins right after we left off: with Marko Elez, the DOGE employee I <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>relentlessly tracked through the bowels</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-six-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025/\"><u>of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/changing-the-treasury-payments-source-code-the-treasurys-doge-gag-order/\"><u>using my anonymous</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-seven-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-yours-and-wireds-reporting-is-actually-doing-something/\"><u>sources in my last</u></a> <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/treasury-secretary-bessents-lawlessness-sorry-readers-read-and-write-code-still-seems-in-play/\"><u>five pieces, resigning</u></a> within an hour of my last piece. His resignation was a gigantic relief for me and allowed me to unwind an enormous amount of stress I had built up over the past week. If you listen to my interviews at either the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhLJfGEF_cE&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Majority Report</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.levernews.com/elon-musks-hostile-takeover/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Lever News</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-05/why-does-elon-musk-want-access-to-the-bureau-of-fiscal-service?srnd=homepage-americas&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Bloomberg’s Odd Lots</u></a> or <a href=\"https://kpfa.org/episode/upfront-february-5-2025/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>radio KPFA last week</u></a>, I think the stress I felt and the enormous burden that weighed on me is clear even as I was professional and kept to the facts as much as possible.</p><p>Subsequent surreal news emerged on this subject (a point I’ll return to), but I was able to keep on resting and the news developed in such a way as to facilitate keeping away from work this weekend. I scrambled to raise the alarm about this issue at the beginning of last week and was successful at doing so while reinforcing my analysis with cutting edge investigative reporting.&nbsp;</p><p>The best I could do on Thursday was update people by updating <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/treasury-secretary-bessents-lawlessness-sorry-readers-read-and-write-code-still-seems-in-play/\"><u>“Afternoon of Day Seven of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025: Treasury Secretary Bessent’s Lawlessness &amp; Sorry Readers- Read and Write Code Still Seems in Play”</u></a> with this brief message at the top:</p><blockquote><strong>UPDATE 4:21 PM: MARKO ELEZ HAS RESIGNED. </strong><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/doge-staffer-resigns-over-racist-posts-d9f11a93?st=eMRyR5&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><strong>WALL STREET JOURNAL CLAIMS IT WAS OVER \"RACIST POSTS\"</strong></a><strong>. OBVIOUSLY NOT TRUE- WIRED, TALKING POINTS MEMO AND I GOT HIM. NEED TO REST, MORE TOMORROW</strong></blockquote><p>I, of course, did not end up doing a piece on Friday. So let’s unpack my E-telegram here and what I mean.&nbsp;</p><p>At <a href=\"https://archive.ph/k1FGs?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>3:53 PM on Thursday, February 6th</u></a> the Wall Street Journal published an article by Katherine Long entitled <a href=\"https://archive.ph/k1FGs?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“DOGE Staffer Resigns Over Racist Posts”</u></a>. Obviously this announcement was met with celebration from me and others, including statements from me about having “gotten” him. This caused confusion with some on social media even crediting me with Katherine Long’s investigative efforts. To be absolutely clear: <strong>I did not nor did I ever claim to have found archived racist posts from Marko Elez</strong>. What I meant was something entirely different.</p><p>It is very common in business and governmental circles for someone to be fired or “resign” after getting into trouble. It is especially common for <strong>the stated reason given</strong> to not be the <strong>actual reason</strong>. This means divining what is actually happening requires a critical and skeptical eye to such news reports. Ask yourself this question: <strong>is it believable that the second Trump administration is pushing out employees for racist posts</strong>, let alone almost as soon as those racist posts come to light? Recall that Long’s article states “After the Journal inquired about the account, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that Elez had resigned from his role.” Does this pass the “smell test” as a plausible reason for you?</p><p>It is <strong>far more likely</strong>, though can’t be confirmed as a fact at this stage, that the increasing public pressure based on Wired, Talking Points Memo and my reporting (as well as likely increasing private pressure from former government officials and financial and corporate figures) converged with the reporter getting in touch and created a convenient cover story for Marko Elez’s resignation. Recall that his resignation was official as of sometime Thursday Afternoon which is only 1.5 working days after the release of my Bloomberg Oddlots interview, the first business outlet that truly dramatized the stakes. In governmental terms, that is a split second. Marko Elez was also the subject of a court injunction that very morning which was bad press even if there were potentially dramatic loopholes in that may have even allowed Marco Elez to continue having <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/treasury-secretary-bessents-lawlessness-sorry-readers-read-and-write-code-still-seems-in-play/\"><u>“read and write” access to source code</u></a>.</p><p>It’s not hard to imagine that the Op Ed out today by Robert Rubin, Lawrence Summers, Timothy Geithner, Jacob Lew and Janet Yellen <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/opinion/treasure-secretaries-doge-musk.html?unlocked_article_code=1.v04.cttd.fDMgcErpM5eh&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“Five Former Treasury Secretaries: Our Democracy Is Under Siege”</u></a> reflects more varied and heterogeneous efforts last week to intervene in treasury secretary Bessent’s reckless support of DOGE’s despoiling of the Treasury’s payments system.

It does not have the “wiggle room” that that injunction has and the Attorney General offices involved seem to have been focused on the difficulty of trying to enforce “middle ground” injunctions like “read only access”. I’m biased of course, but clearly my newsletter contributed something to their effort since they cited it on this very point.

So far, nowhere near enough rich people are paying their fair share.\n\nNote to Readers: I am on bluesky, an alternative to twitter. It's been hard to let go of twitter since that is where I built my following, but clearly it's becoming less usable and there are obvious concerns about getting traction about a Musk story on the Everything Musk app. I have also started an instagram for Notes on the Crises which is currently being populated with my articles.\n\nFinally, I'm known as a crypto skeptic, and I am, but that doesn't mean I won't accept people giving away bitcoin to me. Here's my address: bc1qegxarzsfga9ycesfa7wm77sqmuqqv7083c6ss6\n\nThrough my reporting it has become clear that “read and write” and “read only” are phrases that are being used in many conflicting ways and that the Trump Administration, DOGE and Elon Musk are using this to their advantage. There is “read and write code access” and “read and write data access”. The differences are essential and it is essential that any injunction for “read only” access, at the very least, apply to both data and code.\n\nThis also connects to my reporting this morning. I had very little time to write up the story and get full approval from my sources (who always have full approval since they are the ones at risk) which meant I had very limited time to get advice from experts (or frankly, to take a breath and do some “slow” thinking). Having spoken to a number of sources unfamiliar with the situation since my reporting came out, it is now clear that my sources do not yet have information on whether or not Marko Elez can change code in these highly sensitive systems. “Insert only” permissions only apply to database access and tell us nothing about code access.\n\nThis clarification comes as the text of the Court Order (based on agreement between the parties lawyers) brings reason to think that the text leads to a potential loophole to “read only” access which Treasury will, or is, exploit to give Marko Elez read and write code access. Thus my sources are aligning with the cynical reading of the court order. The ability to read and write code is of course the central disaster the newsletter has been focused on, and frankly the horror of the idea that Marko Elez would or did have “read and write” access for data has not fully been a part of my thinking or alarm (except as a “hacking” situation). \n\nSo what’s the issue? The wording of the court order for Marko Elez to have “read only” access is ambiguous. Specifically it says:\n\nMr. Marko Elez, a Special Government Employee in the Department of the Treasury, as needed for the performance of his duties, provided that such access to payment records will be \"read only\" [emphasis added]\n\nRecords are data which means that a cynical government lawyer may approve “read and write” access for code on the grounds that Marko Elez is only barred from modifying or adding new data to payment records directly rather than indirectly through editing source code. The plaintiffs position would of course, correctly, claim that “read and write code access” is a violation of this order as written. Nevertheless, the possibility is extremely concerning. And remember- “read only code and data” access is still “catastrophic”\n\nSubscribe\n\nAll this comes as CNN and other outlets confirm that some of the worst case scenarios I was worried about are true. The truly bizarre and shocking story confirms Talking Points Memo reporting regarding already putting code into production to stop payments (Tech Dirt had a very good discussion based on Wired’s and TPM’s reporting). However, it goes well beyond that. The entire story is worth a full and complete read but I will quote the a sampling of extremely alarming statements:\n\nFour days after Donald Trump’s inauguration, Elon Musk’s top lieutenants at the Treasury Department asked its acting secretary, a career civil servant, to immediately shut off all USAID payments using the department’s own ultra-sensitive payment processing system. [...]\n\n“What we would like to do is, to the extent permitted by law, temporarily pause the automatic processing of payment files,” from a USAID division called Health Systems Strengthening, [Treasury Chief of Staff] Katz wrote.\n\nKatz also wrote that Krause, Musk’s deputy at Treasury, should be given access to the payments system so he and his team could take action.\n\nSome of the administration’s plan, Katz added, included immediately pausing all payment files still in the queue and letting Krause and others look at individual payments certified by USAID for the health care systems. The State Department could then look closer at the payments through USAID, Katz added. [...]\n\n“There are also practical and personal liability issues that may come into play,” Lebryk wrote, copying a lawyer from the Treasury Department’s general counsel’s office.\n\nBut Krause, the special hire from DOGE sent to Treasury, was undeterred. “I would also recommend you consider an equal alternative liability,” he wrote to Lebryk. [...]\n\nInitially, Bessent didn’t give Krause and DOGE any limitation on its access to the system, which Lebryk opposed, according to a source familiar with the exchange. [Emphasis Added]\n\nThis is among the worst case scenarios I wrote about on Monday (including in Rolling Stone) outside of total system meltdown. \n\nAs I said on Monday:\n\nThis is the absolutely crucial part. Without political control of the payment's heart, the Trump administration and Elon Musk must chase down every agency and bend it to their will. They are in the process of doing that, but bureaucrats can notionally continue to respect the law and resist their efforts. They are helped in this effort by court injunctions they can point to. This is bureaucratic trench warfare. But if Musk and Trump can reach into the choke point, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, they could possibly not need agency cooperation. They can just impound agency payments themselves. They could also possibly stop paying federal employees they have forced on paid administrative leave, coercing them to resign. These possibilities are what every Treasury expert I’ve talked to instantly thought of the moment they read the Washington Post reporting and are incredibly alarmed about.\n\nI have never felt worse about being completely right in my entire life. If anything, I have not been striking a dire enough tone.\n\nEvery single person involved in this, from Secretary Bessent to Chief of Staff Dan Katz needs to be removed from the Treasury, not just Krause and Marko Elez. This all also adds credibility to what I reported from two anonymous sources on Monday:\n\nI can exclusively report here for the first time that Scott Bessent was advised that what Donald Trump wanted in a Treasury Secretary was a person who would have the credibility Steve Mnuchin had with Wall Street but who would be loyal to Trump above all other considerations, according to two sources familiar with the situation. This included, but was not limited to, unconditionally agreeing to work with whomever Trump sent over to the Treasury Department and helping go after Donald Trump’s enemies.\n\nNo outlet has even mentioned that I reported this because of how explosive it is. They will only mention my reporting if they receive independent corroboration. I hope they do. The fact that there is no current mechanism for removing these people from the Treasury means that this is the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War. It could be the greatest crisis in United States history since the Civil War.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSo what’s the latest state of play on the ground? A source familiar with the situation tells me that \n\nI have heard he[Marko Elez] is still on many development-related projects he shouldn't be if he is just being a passive 'read only' observer (which is still catastrophic)\n\nWhen you combine this with the previous reporting, understanding that “insert only” only applies to data and the dishonest reading of the court order that seems to be available it seems like “read only” is just a total sham and Marko Elez still has read and write code access even if he “only” has “read only” access to data. The injunction is them on notice that people outside care, but they still have not brought this situation down to “catastrophic”. It is still “apocalyptic”. A source familiar with the situation says:\n\nMy inclination on any type of question like this is that he has more access, not less and whatever access he doesn't have, he's trying to get\n\nSorry readers, There’s not really good news to be had-yet\n\nSubscribeInstitutional subscription detailsPrinter Friendly Version","html":"<h2 id=\"update-421-pm-marko-elez-has-resigned-wall-street-journal-claims-it-was-over-racist-posts-obviously-not-truewired-talking-points-memo-and-i-got-him-need-to-rest-more-tomorrow\">UPDATE 4:21 PM: MARKO ELEZ HAS RESIGNED. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/doge-staffer-resigns-over-racist-posts-d9f11a93?st=eMRyR5&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">WALL STREET JOURNAL CLAIMS IT WAS OVER \"RACIST POSTS\"</a>.

[...]</blockquote><blockquote>“What we would like to do is, to the extent permitted by law, <strong>temporarily pause the automatic processing of payment files,”</strong> from a USAID division called Health Systems Strengthening, [Treasury Chief of Staff] Katz wrote.</blockquote><blockquote>Katz also wrote that Krause, Musk’s deputy at Treasury, should be given access to the payments system so he and his team could take action.</blockquote><blockquote>Some of the administration’s plan, Katz added, included immediately pausing all payment files still in the queue and letting Krause and others look at individual payments certified by USAID for the health care systems. The State Department could then look closer at the payments through USAID, Katz added. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>“There are also practical and personal liability issues that may come into play,” Lebryk wrote, copying a lawyer from the Treasury Department’s general counsel’s office.</blockquote><blockquote>But Krause, the special hire from DOGE sent to Treasury, was undeterred. “I would also recommend you consider an equal alternative liability,” he wrote to Lebryk. [...]</blockquote><blockquote>Initially, Bessent didn’t give Krause and DOGE any limitation on its access to the system, which Lebryk opposed, according to a source familiar with the exchange. [Emphasis Added]</blockquote><p>This is among the worst case scenarios I <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>wrote about on Monday</u></a> (including in <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-doge-treasury-payment-systems-report-1235252444/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Rolling Stone</u></a>) outside of total system meltdown.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfSrnhbq17cJhuhKdqCqdjaP5AbmajxunZ0FIvhtnTtJAFeWXLN7tmdyCn732ZlzMkRDnXTruUskhjoyXbqxBzrKxbzsP1lFc2cy2pNE4oGRmcjvp1LEyTS491viWMI-qzuMmIg?key=XyC64LEPo_d2BlsCgkMLpNSn\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"313\"></figure><p>As I said <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>on Monday</u></a>:</p><blockquote>This is the absolutely <strong>crucial part. </strong>Without political control of the payment's heart, the Trump administration and Elon Musk must chase down every agency and bend it to their will. They are in the process of doing that, but bureaucrats can notionally continue to respect the law and resist their efforts. They are helped in this effort by court injunctions they can point to. This is bureaucratic trench warfare. But if Musk and Trump can reach into the choke point, the<strong> Bureau of the Fiscal Service,</strong> they could possibly <strong>not need</strong> agency cooperation. They can just <strong>impound agency payments themselves</strong>. They could also possibly <strong>stop paying federal employees they have forced on paid administrative leave, coercing them to resign</strong>. These possibilities are what every Treasury expert I’ve talked to instantly thought of the moment they read the Washington Post reporting and are incredibly alarmed about.</blockquote><p>I have never felt worse about being completely right in my entire life. If anything, I have not been striking a <strong>dire enough</strong> tone.</p><p>Every single person involved in this, from Secretary Bessent to Chief of Staff Dan Katz needs to be removed from the Treasury, not just Krause and Marko Elez. This all also adds credibility to what I reported from two anonymous sources on Monday:</p><blockquote>I can exclusively report here for the first time that Scott Bessent was advised that <strong>what Donald Trump wanted in a Treasury Secretary was a person who would have the credibility Steve Mnuchin had with Wall Street but who would be loyal to Trump above all other considerations, according to two sources familiar with the situation</strong>. This included, but was not limited to, unconditionally agreeing to work with whomever Trump sent over to the Treasury Department and helping go after Donald Trump’s enemies.</blockquote><p>No outlet has even mentioned that I reported this because of how explosive it is. They will only mention my reporting if they receive independent corroboration. I hope they do. The fact that there is no current mechanism for removing these people from the Treasury means that this is the <strong>greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War</strong>. It could be the greatest crisis in <strong>United States history since the Civil War</strong>.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>So what’s the latest state of play on the ground?

So far, nowhere near enough rich people are paying their fair share.\n\nNote to Readers: I am on bluesky, an alternative to twitter. It's been hard to let go of twitter since that is where I built my following, but clearly it's becoming less usable and there are obvious concerns about getting traction about a Musk story on the Everything Musk app. I have also started an Instagram for Notes on the Crises which is currently being populated with my articles.\n\nFinally, I'm known as a crypto skeptic, and I am, but that doesn't mean I won't accept people giving away bitcoin to me. Here's my address: bc1qegxarzsfga9ycesfa7wm77sqmuqqv7083c6ss6\n\n\n\nI originally was going to do a media roundup but it was getting so long that it would distract from my original reporting. I may have a whole piece devoted to a media roundup this afternoon. Anyway, time to dive in.\n\nThe war over “Read and Write” continues. In court, in congress & in the press on Wednesday the Trump administration had been officially denying that DOGE programmers had Read and Write access. For the first time, the administration has acknowledged by name that Marko Elez has access to the top secret systems of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s payment systems. No one in government had publicly acknowledged that the 25 year old former Spacex programmer had such sensitive access. Their “defense” of this is that this is “read only” access.\n\nWe’ll return to whether that is true in a moment. For now it's important to step back and understand how enormous of an acknowledgement that is. To have “read only” access would involve enormous security risks and the ability to exploit extremely, absurdly, sensitive information to the benefit of Elon Musk, Trump and his inner orbit or anyone else that Marko Elez or DOGE employees (and in some cases, seemingly not employees) feels like. For more on this, read the end of my first article yesterday.\n\nFor now, there seems to be a tiny bit of good news which also confirms the previous reporting by Wired, myself and Talking Points Memo. I can exclusively report that Marko Elez had full “read and write” privileges. A source familiar with the situation stated to me:\n\nIt's likely yours and WIRED's reporting is actually doing something. On Saturday, they had given Marko read/write access and marked his access request as completed and closed. There was no mistake in their wording: they explicitly said they had given Marko  read/write access to SPS. On Wednesday, they reopened his access request and stated his permissions were now read only. [Emphasis Added]\n\nSo the reporting on this has had a dramatic effect on the U.S. Treasury. They are hearing the outside voices and the increasing alarm emerging throughout the country and they are reacting, however limited that reaction is. \n\nIt's important to understand that this happened before the injunction which as of this writing was agreed to late on wednesday between Three Federal Unions and the Department of Justice over access to Treasury records. Unconscionably in my view, though I can’t speak to the legal specifics of the case (too much to do), the Union’s lawyers have agreed to “read only” access for Thomas Krause and Marko Elez. I hope the judge blocks the injunction and pushes for something more stringent.\n\nA source familiar with the situation who I asked about the current circumstances and the latest state of play of “read only” versus ‘read and write” had this to say:\n\nAgain, it's a distinction that doesn't matter too much to me. He shouldn't have access to this almost 5 trillion dollar payment flow, even if it's \"read-only\". He shouldn't even be at Fiscal Service. None of this should be happening and it's only going to get worse the longer \"DOGE\" is here and the more they learn about what they can do and get away with.\n\nIn other words, while it's good news that they are reacting to our reporting, the situation still remains catastrophic at best and we can’t relent until this has been resolved. The courts also need to do a better job here (to the extent that’s even possible). \n\nI will also say that I’ve had the most consistent, most detailed and most up-to-date reporting so I do not think it is any exaggeration to say that this is uniquely related to my efforts. I have been doing interviews non-stop and, notably, Bloomberg’s Oddlots posted their episode at 4 AM. Oddlots is the first mainstream financial press publication which has taken this issue seriously (outside of similar “straight laced” news coverage like the Times or the Wall Street Journal has been doing).\n\nIt also helps that my contribution was the most dramatic, concerning and specific Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway could have gotten from a guest (that was willing to speak on the record). If you have personal knowledge of the release of my Oddlots episode or any other reporting causing concern or alarm at the White House, at DOGE or the U.S. Treasury please contact me by email or securely over Signal. As an aside, every single American should currently be migrating all their text messaging to Signal.\n\nStill, the question remains, is Marko Elez actually “read only”? I can exclusively report here that the answer is “kind of”. Specifically, a source familiar with the situation knows for a fact that Marko Elez’s access was set to “insert” for the Secure Payment System (SPS), which is distinct from “alter”. According to a source unfamiliar with the situation this type of permission lets you “add a row to a table” which is a “type of write access but very limited”. According to my source who is unfamiliar with the situation it lets you “create data but not change its structure or delete it, create tables etc.”\n\nWhat can be done with this permission? By definition, my source unfamiliar with the situation can’t say. My unfamiliar source points out that “a lot of that also does depend on the structure of the overall system, inserting things into tables could certainly do things like stop payments!”. Of course, this source is simply speculating. The only way to know for sure is to hear from a current COBOL programmer working on PAM, SPS or another highly sensitive system which makes sure trillions of dollars of Treasury payments go out each year.\n\nIt can’t be confirmed with 100% certainty how many systems Marko Elez’s permissions were switched to “insert only”. A source familiar with the situation says in reference to this:  \n\nPAM [Payment Automation Manager] I am still trying to figure out. \n\nA source familiar with the situation states that there is some evidence that these changes were identical across “object schemas” but as of this writing the only change to “insert only” access that can be confirmed is the Secure Payment System (SPS). \n\nSo from what we know as of this moment, DOGE’s Marko Elez’s permissions got switched from “read and write” to “read and limited write” for SPS, and there is reason to believe, but not confirmation, that this was true across systems. The capacity for “insert” to wreak havoc is not currently known by any source I have or any publicly known information. It requires understanding the system architecture and business logic of the most top secret mainframes in the world- well most top secret until Marko Elez got into them. Given DOGE’s outside, insecure equipment throughout the Federal Government and ability to get alone time with systems elsewhere, it can’t be ruled out that Marko Elez can break into the system and give himself his full “read and write” privileges back.\n\nIn short, keep it up and let's keep on escalating the scale of the objections to this profoundly dire situation. You are not powerless, however the rush shock of this terrifying moment makes you feel.\n\nSubscribeInstitutional subscription detailsPrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><strong>Notes on the Crises pivoted over the weekend into around the clock coverage of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025</strong></p><p><strong>Read </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><strong><u>Part 0</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><strong><u>Part 1</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><strong><u>Part 2</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-six-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025/\"><strong><u>Part 3</u></strong></a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/changing-the-treasury-payments-source-code-the-treasurys-doge-gag-order/\"><strong><u>Part </u></strong></a><strong><u>4</u></strong></p><p><em>If you are a <strong>current or former career Bureau of the Fiscal Service Employee</strong>, especially if you’re a legacy IT programmer with years of experience<strong> and especially if you are a COBOL programmer currently working on the PAM, SPS or any other adjacent team,</strong> contact me </em><a href=\"mailto:crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><em><u>over email</u></em></a><em> or over signal — </em><a href=\"https://signal.me/?ref=crisesnotes.com#eu/TJspTqx16dD39zG7EKpRYYli9_GTNen7cEL7sAug9gdsPRAdW41JzIywiy5y3lXF\"><em><u>linked here</u></em></a><em>.

The courts also need to do a better job here (to the extent that’s even possible).&nbsp;</p><p>I will also say that I’ve had the most consistent, most detailed and most up-to-date reporting so I do not think it is any exaggeration to say that this is uniquely related to my efforts. I have been doing interviews non-stop and, notably, Bloomberg’s Oddlots <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-05/why-does-elon-musk-want-access-to-the-bureau-of-fiscal-service?srnd=homepage-americas&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>posted their episode at 4 AM</u></a>. Oddlots is the first mainstream financial press publication which has taken this issue seriously (outside of similar “straight laced” news coverage like the Times or the Wall Street Journal has been doing). </p><p>It also helps that my contribution was the most dramatic, concerning and specific Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway could have gotten from a guest (that was willing to speak on the record). If you have personal knowledge of the release of my Oddlots episode or any other reporting causing concern or alarm at the White House, at DOGE or the U.S. Treasury please contact me by email or securely over Signal. As an aside, every single American should currently be migrating all their text messaging to Signal.</p><p>Still, the question remains, is Marko Elez actually “read only”? I can exclusively report here that the answer is <strong>“kind of”</strong>. Specifically, a source familiar with the situation knows for a fact that Marko Elez’s access was set to “insert” for the Secure Payment System (SPS), which is distinct from “alter”. According to a source unfamiliar with the situation this type of permission lets you “add a row to a table” which is a “<strong>type of write access but very limited”</strong>. According to my source who is unfamiliar with the situation it lets you “create data but not change its structure or delete it, create tables etc.”</p><p>What can be done with this permission? By definition, my source unfamiliar with the situation can’t say. My unfamiliar source points out that “a lot of that also does depend on the structure of the overall system, inserting things into tables could certainly do things like stop payments!”. Of course, this source is simply speculating. The only way to know for sure is to hear from a current COBOL programmer working on PAM, SPS or another highly sensitive system which makes sure trillions of dollars of Treasury payments go out each year.</p><p>It can’t be confirmed with 100% certainty how many systems Marko Elez’s permissions were switched to “insert only”. A source familiar with the situation says in reference to this:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote>PAM [Payment Automation Manager] I am still trying to figure out.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>A source familiar with the situation states that there is some evidence that these changes were identical across “object schemas” but as of this writing the only change to “insert only” access that can be confirmed is the Secure Payment System (SPS).&nbsp;</p><p>So from what we know as of this moment, DOGE’s Marko Elez’s permissions got switched from “read and write”<strong> to “read and limited write”</strong> for SPS, and there is reason to believe, but not confirmation, that this was true across systems. The capacity for “insert” to wreak havoc is not currently known by any source I have or any publicly known information. It requires understanding the system architecture and business logic of the most top secret mainframes in the world- well most top secret until Marko Elez got into them. Given DOGE’s outside,<a href=\"https://fedscoop.com/opm-server-lawsuit-temporary-restraining-order-musk-doge/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> insecure equipment throughout the Federal Government</u></a> and ability to get alone time with systems elsewhere, it can’t be ruled out that Marko Elez can break into the system and <strong>give himself his full “read and write” privileges back</strong>.</p><p>In short, keep it up and let's keep on escalating the scale of the objections to this profoundly dire situation. You are not powerless, however the rush shock of this terrifying moment makes you feel.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/special-announcement-institutional-subscriptions-are-here-get-your-academic-library-or-business-to-subscribe/\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Institutional subscription details</a></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/Day-Seven-of-the-Trump-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025--Yours-and-WIRED-s-Reporting-is-Actually-Doing-Something-.pdf\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Printer Friendly Version</a></div>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-seven-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-yours-and-wireds-reporting-is-actually-doing-something/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"4d3ac99a-7873-43a6-880f-42373f764014","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"67a4661719a2b4000198b977","reading_time":6}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"February 5","id":"Ghost__Post__67a319f119a2b4000196e4a9","title":"Day Six of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025: “Treasury has been denying that they gave Marko write access, but I am looking at his access request right now”","slug":"day-six-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025","featured":true,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/02/Day-Six-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025.png","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b80808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/e88af9486f93bddb97493d58babc9432/2ce52/Day-Six-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025.png","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/e88af9486f93bddb97493d58babc9432/95148/Day-Six-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025.png 401w,\n/migrantinsider/static/e88af9486f93bddb97493d58babc9432/451b9/Day-Six-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025.png 802w,\n/migrantinsider/static/e88af9486f93bddb97493d58babc9432/2ce52/Day-Six-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025.png 1603w","sizes":"(min-width: 1603px) 1603px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/e88af9486f93bddb97493d58babc9432/b1265/Day-Six-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025.webp 401w,\n/migrantinsider/static/e88af9486f93bddb97493d58babc9432/416f6/Day-Six-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025.webp 802w,\n/migrantinsider/static/e88af9486f93bddb97493d58babc9432/1c663/Day-Six-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025.webp 1603w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1603px) 1603px, 100vw"}]},"width":1603,"height":830}}},"excerpt":"If you are a current or former career Bureau of the Fiscal Service Employee, especially if you’re a legacy IT programmer with years of experience and especially if you are a COBOL programmer currently working on the PAM, SPS or any other adjacent team, contact me over email or over signal — linked here.

The additional thing you get is me trying to stop the Treasury’s internal payment system from melting down or Musk taking your confidential information, along with everyone else's. So far, nowhere near enough rich people are paying their fair share.\n\n\n\nNote to Readers: I have not mentioned this in the past, but I am on bluesky, an alternative to twitter. It's been hard to let go of twitter since that is where I built my following, but clearly it's becoming less usable and there are obvious concerns about getting traction about a Musk story on the Everything Musk app. I have also started an instagram for Notes on the Crises which will be populated soon.\n\nFirst some media, then some new reporting:\n\nEconomist Paul Krugman, who left the New York Times recently because of its increasingly hostile and hamfisted constraints on his editorial independence, has a very generous citation to my work in his newsletter yesterday:\n\nFor the moment they probably can’t. The federal payments system is immensely complex, and like most government infrastructure has been financially squeezed for decades. So it’s cobbled together, much of it running on old hardware and even older software, kept functioning thanks to old hands and institutional memory. The 20-somethings Musk is deploying to take over, locking out those old hands and pushing aside the people who know how the system works, almost surely don’t understand enough to politicize payments right away.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAs Nathan Tankus, the go-to expert on these matters, says,\n\nI 100% believe that the primary barrier to Elon Musk gaining control of the Treasury payments system is COBOL.\n\nFor readers mystified by the reference, COBOL is a very old programming language that was once pervasive in the business world but in which hardly anyone under 60 knows how to program — yet is still widely used in government. (During Covid, the state of New Jersey put out a frantic call for people who knew COBOL to implement expanded unemployment benefits.)\n\nBut this observation raises another concern. What if the Musk people — Muskovites? — try to muck with systems they don’t understand, believing that they’re super smart and can master everything with the help of a little AI? It’s not hard to imagine the whole federal payments system — including, by the way, servicing of federal debt — crashing.\n\nSo much damage — to U.S. credibility, to the Constitution and the rule of law, and possibly even to the very functioning of the government. And Trump only took power 2 weeks ago.\n\nSo thanks Paul. As I clarified in my newsletter yesterday, it’s largely the complicated and layered business logic and system architecture wrapped in COBOL, rather than COBOL in the abstract, which is the barrier.\n\nUPDATE 9:01 AM: my interview yesterday with Bloomberg Odd Lots- which was actually scheduled in January before all hell broke loose!- is out. Give it a listen here's the description:\n\nElon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have gained access to a unit within the Treasury Department called the Bureau of Fiscal Service. But what does this unit actually do? How critical of a role does it play in the operations of government, and potentially, financial markets? On this episode, we speak with Nathan Tankus, the author of the Notes On The Crises newsletter. He explains both the technical aspect of this office, as well as the legal questions surrounding impoundment and the ability of the executive branch to cut off payments that have been previously authorized by Congress. We also talk about the operational risks and the potential disaster scenario should this system — which has been built in COBOL over decades — go down.\n\n\n\nYesterday, the Acting Assistant Treasury Secretary Jonathan Blum sent a letter on behalf of the United States Treasury responding to Senator Wyden (with identical letters as well to other members of congress) regarding the Treasury Payments crisis. Among other claims and meaningless assurances, it states:\n\nCurrently, Treasury staff members working with Tom Krause, a Treasury employee, will have read-only access to the coded data of the Fiscal Service’s payment systems in order to continue this operational efficiency assessment. [Emphasis added]\n\nI stand by my reporting and thus this is either a lie or a carefully worded evasion. Specifically, the statement could be worded to avoid confirming or denying that they also have write access. To explain what I mean, we must jump to the facts.\n\nSubscribe\n\nOne source is aware of this letter and explicitly denied it late yesterday:\n\nTreasury has been denying that they gave Marko write access, but I am looking at his access request right now and it has the Deputy Assistant Commissioner for IT Operations instructing the team to disregard all previous instructions and assign Marko read/write privileges for the database. \n\nThus, one way that this letter could be technically true in a bizarre and wildly dishonest sense is that by first having “read-only” access and then having “read and write” access, they could be said to have “read-only” and “read and write” access simultaneously.\n\nBut probably the United States Treasury is just lying. \n\nImportantly, according to a source familiar with the situation, Krause does not have a Bureau of the Fiscal Service laptop or email yet. This source says, regarding the fact that the letter does not mention Marko Elez, states “That’s definitely a purposeful evasion”\n\nSubscribe\n\nIn any case, the situation remains extraordinarily, incomprehensibly dire as they continue to have “read and write” access. According to a source familiar with the situation a senior IT employee shared a schedule of blackouts (system outages, typically for maintenance which can include system code changes) for the Payment Automation Manager (PAM), International Treasury Services (ITS) & the Standard Application for Payments (ASAP) to Marko Elez. Recall that PAM is the primary way for the Treasury to send payments, having sent 4.7 trillion dollars last year. \n\nAs I reported in my piece on Monday, ASAP is the crucial mechanism that sends payments to “state and local governments, educational and financial institutions, vendors and contractors, profit and non-profit entities and Indian tribal organizations.” If you want to selectively impound spending, and particularly if you want to target specific non-profits or other disfavored entities (or agencies), this is a crucial system to get control of. Whether they can and how quickly is an extremely open question. Nor do we know that those blackouts were or will be for system changes. A source familiar with the situation has seen Marko involved with conversations about ASAP.\n\nThe other system, International Treasury Payments, is for all international payments. So if you want to target people or entities (crucially foreign non-profits and foreign countries, among many others) that the U.S. government disburses funds to, this is a system you would need to get a handle on. The desire to cut off foreign aid has been repeatedly stated by Trump on down, and if they can get operational control this system would be critical to doing that. Between PAM and ITS this is most of the payments the United States Treasury processes. This is an extraordinary amount of access which, as I said yesterday, is not held by senior IT employees at BFS.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the situation, that same senior IT employee shared “technical documentation and guides” with Marko Elez which explain how to connect and operate a mainframe. It appears to be, though my source can’t confirm, the same one running PAM. According to a source familiar with the situation that makes it \n\nplausible that \"DOGE\" could obtain sufficient technical knowledge to implement some of its horrible ideas. That would likely be worse than outright breaking things, but it remains to be seen what they're actually doing.\n\nIt's important to understand that this source works in the IT operations department and thus is not one of the COBOL programmers working on these systems. I do not have insight into that, which is the main blindspot I’ve had in my current reporting. If you are a current BFS employee working directly on PAM, ITS, ASAP or any of the other COBOL systems I would urge you to get into contact. If you are a relative or friend of someone who works on these systems, I would encourage you to have them contact me (signal & email information above). This could not possibly be more important.\n\nA source familiar with the situation also states that Mark0 Elez has been receiving lots of “technical contact lists”, including for the Secure Payment System (SPS). This source speculates that this means that the teams working on systems like PAM are “mostly intact”. Why seek out contact lists if it's not actually going to help you if a bunch of the people on the list have been fired or pushed to resign?\n\nWhen asked about the general mood at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service my source states:\n\nEveryone else just wants to keep their heads down. They're all miserable and I think they're just trying not to get targeted or fired. Senior leadership seems to be complying with them. No one is really talking openly about it, but it just seems like people are miserable and stressed out. Morale seems very low. We enjoyed our jobs, we did good work, and now we're being targeted by political powers beyond our control. \n\nA source familiar with the situation stated that there is a general norm forming, which is sometimes explicitly stated, to not discuss the Trump executive orders openly. The obvious issue of surveillance comes to mind in such a situation.\n\nI want to end on a few words stepping back and explaining why this is such a big deal. So they have “read and write” access, or even “read only” access, why do we care? What are the possible consequences? \n\n 1. Musk, Trump and their respective cronies have unrestricted access to your social security numbers, your confidential bank information, your confidential medical information and so much more. \n\nThis is true with just “read only” access. This is why the burgeoning media war (that currently “read only” is winning unfortunately) is something of a red-herring. It matters, don’t get me wrong. As a source yesterday said, Apocalyptic. But that source also said that “read only” was “catastrophic”. If the smash and grab operation commences just as stupidly, quickly and dangerously as it has so far, this could easily become identity theft by an untold number of people using their personally identifiable information within weeks.\n\nThis kind of information can also be used to target enemies and, if they get operational control elsewhere, the capability of using the Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC), & the Combating the Finance of Terror (CFT) laws to target political enemies. Of course, these laws have already been used to target political dissidents; but we are talking about something of an incomprehensibly larger scale. As one long time payments lawyer wrote to me: “Is DOGE using its own, non-OFAC definition of ‘terrorist group’ that has no basis in law?” In this sense, the Democratic party has fully and unequivocally participated in building the apparatus that is showing to be extraordinarily easily weaponized against them. In short, they can not just steal money but eliminate the financial existence of anyone they felt like, if operational control gets sufficient. The week Trump won his second term, I told a room full of Democratic party operatives that “if the Democratic Party really believed Trump was a fascist, they would destroy the servers containing all the surveillance data”\n\n 2. Creating “backdoors” into the Treasury’s multi-trillion dollar payment system\n\nI’m running short on time (it's late at the time of writing) and I have to get up in the morning and be prepared for another round of intensive interviews so this will have to be more carefully detailed in the future. But these are extremely sensitive systems, and complicated systems. All the factors that slow them down in taking over the system are also the factors that would make it hard to find intentionally hidden code to their benefit that could give them ongoing access to the system even if they are removed. I need to do more reporting on this one but it is something many, many sources have mentioned.\n\nSubscribe\n 3. Subordinate the judicial system to the Trump Administration/DOGE\n\nThis one has been hard to get across to readers. As you can imagine, the overwhelming social media response to this reporting has focused on the absurd illegality of the actions. Asking for judicial intervention. But as I covered in my piece Friday, the constitution is not self enforcing and the supreme court is unlikely to step in, or to step in a positive way. In my Friday’s piece I unfortunately presciently asked:\n\nAs a famous twentieth century statesman might have said in this situation \"...and how many divisions does the Constitution have?” \n\nWhat happens if they are just embedded so deeply in the heart of government payments that there is no mechanism to dislodge them? Court Injunctions are not self enforcing either My longtime payments lawyer source agrees with this point, which I also tried to articulate Monday:\n\nChokehold to stop or delay any and all payments initiated by federal agencies, and potential mechanical method to thwart judicial rulings when a judge/court says “You as the Executive Branch cannot stop federal grants/payments lawfully approved and directed by Congress.”\n\nAs we’ve seen, there are no armed law enforcement figures coming in to save the day and if Musk's DOGE get deep enough into the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the only way to enforce the law is through street actions.\n\n 4. Elon Musk can use this system against his enemies.\n\nIt almost feels quant to say because the timeline of so many of the other possibilities are so immediately and dramatically dire that this one almost feels hopeful in comparison in that it implies “competitive position” being something that is very meaningful. Nevertheless, it should be obvious that this information, which includes information on all businesses the Federal Government does business with, is ripe to be used to kneecap competitors. Specifically my longtime payments lawyer source brought up just outright putting competitors on the “do not pay” list. The “good case scenario” may just be an economy increasingly dominated in all corners by Musk and/or Trump through a sprawling network of business ventures with the greatest possible advantages.\n\n 5. The New American Payments System, X the Everything App\n\nFor this one I am just going to quote my longtime payments lawyer source at length. They’ve got it and note this is a “read only” issue. Imagine the worst case of paying your taxes on X payments, or “receiving” your social security payments there.:\n\nObtaining access to and potentially exfiltrating data sets from BFS that may be characterized as “anonymized” (in order to evade criticism about potential violation of privacy laws), but could give insight into payment patterns and payment system strengths, weaknesses and behaviors:\n\n1. Such information obtained on an inside track by DOGE would be very helpful, for example, if you are an entity like X Payments LLC and are currently licensed as a money transmitter in 42 states with plans to launch as-yet-to-be specified payments and financial services.\n\n2. It is unclear whether there are any limitations on DOGE personnel transferring payment information to X Payments LLC in order for that company to gain proprietary information regarding federal payments in an anti-competitive manner compared to its fintech competitors currently in the marketplace.\n\n3. Such single-sourced information not available to other market competitors would provide an anti-competitive jump for X Payments LLC on ApplePay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay (mobile wallets) and a host of other fintech companies in the marketplace backed by venture capital and private equity funding.\n\n 6. Ability to pick and choose who gets public money, regardless of congressional directives\n\nI covered the constitutional aspects of this crisis Friday. The payment aspects I covered Monday. Without Judicial ability or willingness to sanction Trump & Musk, There is very little left of congress. The “power of the purse” is central to the rule and authority of congress. The decentralized (in relative terms) nature of administrative agencies means that there are enormous opportunities for agencies to follow the law. This is a place to skip past all those headaches.\n\nSubscribe\n 7. Catastrophic failure of the payments system.\n\nEven a disruption for a day would be a disaster. A disruption on longer timescales would have unimaginable knock on effects. The Treasury could involuntarily default because of operational issues. The worst case scenarios, which are completely and utterly plausible at the time of writing, would be a catastrophe without precedent. No typical economic calamity like the Great Financial Crisis or even the Great Depression would be comparable. \n\nTLDR, here is what I told Norwegian national daily newspaper Klassekampen, one of the largest newspapers in Norway, when asked for comment:\n\nThe reason this is so incredibly important is that the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's payment system sits at the very heart of the United States Federal Government. 88% of government payments, which amounts to about 5.4 Trillion dollars, flows through this system every year and onto the wider economy. Its social security checks, medicare and medicaid payments to medical providers etc. It's everything, in short. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service is the payments intermediary where all payment orders from the various government agencies get routed to their intended recipients. If anything happened to this system, the payments would not go out and that would lead to catastrophe. It could also lead to an unintentional operational default on United States treasury securities.\n\nIt also is an enormous privacy violation where former employees of Musk who have not properly gotten security clearance are able to install insecure technology and steal the most sensitive information possible. They could theoretically use banking information of people they identify as enemies and put them on terror watch lists, or \"do not pay\" lists if they can get enough operational control at the treasury. Part of why this is, as one current Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee described it, apocalyptic is that all the ways that this can be abused are incalculable and would take years to fully map. To the extent that the sudden collapse of the United States would have a negative effect on the rest of the world, this is as much of a global crisis as it is a national one\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><em>If you are a <strong>current or former career Bureau of the Fiscal Service Employee</strong>, especially if you’re a legacy IT programmer with years of experience<strong> and especially if you are a COBOL programmer currently working on the PAM, SPS or any other adjacent team,</strong> contact me </em><a href=\"mailto:crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><em><u>over email</u></em></a><em> or over signal — </em><a href=\"https://signal.me/?ref=crisesnotes.com#eu/TJspTqx16dD39zG7EKpRYYli9_GTNen7cEL7sAug9gdsPRAdW41JzIywiy5y3lXF\"><em><u>linked here</u></em></a><em>.

The federal payments system is immensely complex, and like most government infrastructure has been financially squeezed for decades. So it’s cobbled together, much of it running on old hardware and even older software, kept functioning thanks to old hands and institutional memory. The 20-somethings Musk is deploying to take over, locking out those old hands and pushing aside the people who know how the system works, almost surely don’t understand enough to politicize payments right away.</blockquote><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><blockquote><strong>As Nathan Tankus, the go-to expert on these matters, says</strong>,</blockquote><blockquote class=\"kg-blockquote-alt\">I 100% believe that the primary barrier to Elon Musk gaining control of the Treasury payments system is COBOL.</blockquote><blockquote>For readers mystified by the reference, COBOL is a very old programming language that was once pervasive in the business world but in which hardly anyone under 60 knows how to program — yet is still widely used in government. (During Covid, the state of New Jersey put out a frantic call for people who knew COBOL to implement expanded unemployment benefits.)</blockquote><blockquote>But this observation raises another concern. What if the Musk people — Muskovites? — try to muck with systems they don’t understand, believing that they’re super smart and can master everything with the help of a little AI? It’s not hard to imagine the whole federal payments system — including, by the way, servicing of federal debt — crashing.</blockquote><blockquote>So much damage — to U.S. credibility, to the Constitution and the rule of law, and possibly even to the very functioning of the government. And Trump only took power 2 weeks ago.</blockquote><p>So thanks Paul. As I clarified <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore/\"><u>in my newsletter yesterday</u></a>, it’s largely the complicated and layered business logic and system architecture wrapped in COBOL, rather than COBOL in the abstract, which is the barrier. <br><br>UPDATE 9:01 AM: my interview yesterday with Bloomberg Odd Lots- which was actually scheduled in January before all hell broke loose!- <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-05/why-does-elon-musk-want-access-to-the-bureau-of-fiscal-service?srnd=homepage-americas&ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">is out.</a> Give it a listen here's the description:</p><blockquote>Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have gained access to a unit within the Treasury Department called the Bureau of Fiscal Service. But what does this unit actually do? How critical of a role does it play in the operations of government, and potentially, financial markets? On this episode, we speak with Nathan Tankus, the author of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Notes On The Crises</em></a>&nbsp;newsletter. He explains both the technical aspect of this office, as well as the legal questions surrounding impoundment and the ability of the executive branch to cut off payments that have been previously authorized by Congress. We also talk about the operational risks and the potential disaster scenario should this system — which has been built in COBOL over decades — go down.</blockquote><ol></ol><p></p><p>Yesterday, the Acting Assistant Treasury Secretary Jonathan Blum sent a letter on behalf of the United States Treasury responding to Senator Wyden (with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/04/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-payments.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>identical letters as well</u></a> to other members of congress) regarding the Treasury Payments crisis. Among other claims and meaningless assurances, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/2025.02.04-Response-to-Sen.-Wyden.pdf\"><u>it states</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Currently, Treasury staff members working with Tom Krause, a Treasury employee,<strong> will have read-only access</strong> to the coded data of the Fiscal Service’s payment systems in order to continue this operational efficiency assessment. [Emphasis added]</blockquote><p>I stand by my reporting and thus this is either a lie or a carefully worded evasion. Specifically, the statement could be worded to avoid confirming or denying that they also have write access. To explain what I mean, we must jump to the facts.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>One source is aware of this letter and explicitly denied it late yesterday:</p><blockquote>Treasury has been denying that they gave Marko write access, <strong>but I am looking at his access request right now </strong>and it has the Deputy Assistant Commissioner for IT Operations instructing the team to <strong>disregard all previous instructions and assign Marko read/write privileges for the database</strong>.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Thus, one way that this letter could be technically true in a bizarre and wildly dishonest sense is that by first having “read-only” access and then having “read and write” access, they could be said to have “read-only” and “read and write” access simultaneously.</p><p>But probably the United States Treasury is just lying.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, according to a source familiar with the situation, Krause does not have a Bureau of the Fiscal Service laptop or email yet. This source says, regarding the fact that the letter does not mention Marko Elez, states “That’s definitely a purposeful evasion”</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>In any case, the <strong>situation remains extraordinarily, incomprehensibly dire</strong> as they continue to have “read and write” access. According to a source familiar with the situation a senior IT employee shared a schedule of blackouts (system outages, typically for maintenance which can include system code changes) for the Payment Automation Manager (PAM), International Treasury Services (ITS) &amp; the Standard Application for Payments (ASAP) to Marko Elez. Recall that PAM is the primary way for the Treasury to send payments, having sent 4.7 trillion dollars last year.&nbsp;</p><p>As I reported in my piece on Monday, ASAP is the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">crucial mechanism that sends</a> payments to “state and local governments, educational and financial institutions, vendors and contractors, profit and non-profit entities and Indian tribal organizations.” If you want to selectively impound spending, and particularly if you want to target specific non-profits or other disfavored entities (or agencies), this is a crucial system to get control of. Whether they can and how quickly is an extremely open question. Nor do we know that those blackouts were or will be for system changes. A source familiar with the situation has seen Marko involved with conversations about ASAP.</p><p>The other system, International Treasury Payments, <a href=\"https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/pia/ITS-pclia.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>is for all international payments</u></a>. So if you want to target people or entities (crucially foreign non-profits and foreign countries, among many others) that the U.S. government disburses funds to, this is a system you would need to get a handle on. The desire to cut off foreign aid has been repeatedly stated by Trump on down, and if they can get operational control this system would be critical to doing that. Between PAM and ITS this is most of the payments the United States Treasury processes. This is an extraordinary amount of access which, as I said yesterday, is not held by senior IT employees at BFS.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>According to a source familiar with the situation, that same senior IT employee shared “technical documentation and guides” with Marko Elez which explain how to connect and operate a mainframe. It appears to be, though my source can’t confirm, the same one running PAM. According to a source familiar with the situation that makes it&nbsp;</p><blockquote>plausible that \"DOGE\" <strong>could obtain sufficient technical knowledge to implement some of its horrible ideas</strong>. That would<strong> likely be worse than outright breaking things</strong>, but it remains to be seen what they're actually doing.</blockquote><p>It's important to understand that this source works in the IT operations department and thus is not one of the COBOL programmers working on these systems. I do not have insight into that, which is the main blindspot I’ve had in my current reporting. If you are a current BFS employee working directly on PAM, ITS, ASAP or any of the other COBOL systems I would <strong>urge you to get into contact</strong>. If you are a<strong> relative or friend of someone who works on these systems</strong>, I would encourage you to have them contact me (signal &amp; email information above). This could not possibly be more important.</p><p>A source familiar with the situation also states that Mark0 Elez has been receiving lots of “technical contact lists”, including for the <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>Secure Payment System (SPS)</u></a>. This source speculates that this means that the teams working on systems like PAM are “mostly intact”. Why seek out contact lists if it's not actually going to help you if a bunch of the people on the list have been fired or pushed to resign?</p><p>When asked about the general mood at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service my source states:</p><blockquote>Everyone else just wants to keep their heads down. They're all miserable and I think they're just trying not to get targeted or fired. Senior leadership seems to be complying with them. No one is really talking openly about it, but it just seems like people are miserable and stressed out. <strong>Morale seems very low. We enjoyed our jobs, we did good work, and now we're being targeted by political powers beyond our control.&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><p>A source familiar with the situation stated that there is a general norm forming, which is sometimes explicitly stated, to not discuss the Trump executive orders openly. The obvious issue of surveillance comes to mind in such a situation.</p><p>I want to end on a few words stepping back and explaining why this is such a big deal. So they have “read and write” access, or even “read only” access, why do we care? What are the possible consequences?&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Musk, Trump and their respective cronies have unrestricted access to your social security numbers, your confidential bank information, your confidential medical information and so much more.&nbsp;</strong></li></ol><p>This is true with <strong>just “read only”</strong> access. This is why the burgeoning media war (that currently “read only” is winning unfortunately) is something of a red-herring. It matters, don’t get me wrong. As a source yesterday said, Apocalyptic. But that source also said that “read only” was “catastrophic”. If the smash and grab operation commences just as stupidly, quickly and dangerously as it has so far, this could easily become<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/musk-treasury-social-security-access-federal-payment-system-trump/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u> identity theft by an untold number of people</u></a> using their personally identifiable information within weeks.</p><p>This kind of information can also be used to target enemies and, if they get operational control elsewhere, the capability of using the <a href=\"https://georgialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raul-Carrillo-Seeing-Through-Money-Democracy-Data-Governance-and-the-Digital-Dollar-57-Georgia-Law-Review-1207-2023.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC)</u></a>, &amp; the Combating the Finance of Terror (CFT) laws to target political enemies. Of course, these laws have already been used to <a href=\"https://x.com/NathanTankus/status/1846227224287973422?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>target political dissidents</u></a>; but we are talking about something of an incomprehensibly larger scale. As one long time payments lawyer wrote to me: “Is DOGE using its own, non-OFAC definition of ‘terrorist group’ that has no basis in law?” In this sense, the Democratic party has fully and unequivocally participated in <a href=\"https://georgialawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raul-Carrillo-Seeing-Through-Money-Democracy-Data-Governance-and-the-Digital-Dollar-57-Georgia-Law-Review-1207-2023.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>building the apparatus that is showing to be extraordinarily easily weaponized against them</u></a>. In short, they can not just steal money but eliminate the financial existence of anyone they felt like, if operational control gets sufficient.

But these are extremely sensitive systems, and complicated systems. All the factors that slow them down in taking over the system are also the factors that would make it hard to find intentionally hidden code to their benefit that could give them ongoing access to the system even if they are removed.

As you can imagine, the overwhelming social media response to this reporting has focused on the absurd illegality of the actions. Asking for judicial intervention. But as I covered in my piece Friday, the constitution is not self enforcing and the supreme court is unlikely to step in, or to step in a positive way. In my Friday’s piece I unfortunately <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>presciently asked</u></a>:</p><blockquote>As a famous twentieth century statesman might have said in this situation \"...and how many divisions does the Constitution have?”&nbsp;</blockquote><p>What happens if they are just embedded so deeply in the heart of government payments that there is no mechanism to dislodge them? Court Injunctions are not self enforcing either My longtime payments lawyer source agrees with this point, which I also tried to <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/\"><u>articulate Monday</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Chokehold to stop or delay any and all payments initiated by federal agencies, and potential mechanical method to thwart judicial rulings when a judge/court says “You as the Executive Branch cannot stop federal grants/payments lawfully approved and directed by Congress.”</blockquote><p>As we’ve seen, there are no armed law enforcement figures coming in to save the day and if Musk's DOGE get deep enough into the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the only way to enforce the law is through street actions.</p><ol start=\"4\"><li><strong>Elon Musk can use this system against his enemies.</strong></li></ol><p>It almost feels quant to say because the timeline of so many of the other possibilities are so immediately and dramatically dire that this one almost feels hopeful in comparison in that it implies “competitive position” being something that is very meaningful. Nevertheless, it should be obvious that this information, which includes information on all businesses the Federal Government does business with, is ripe to be used to kneecap competitors. Specifically my longtime payments lawyer source brought up just outright putting competitors on the “do not pay” list.

Such information obtained on an inside track by DOGE would be very helpful, for example, if you are an <strong>entity like X Payments LLC and are currently licensed as a money transmitter in 42 states with plans to launch as-yet-to-be specified payments and financial services.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>2. It is unclear <strong>whether there are any limitations on DOGE personnel transferring payment information to X Payments LLC</strong> in order for that company to gain proprietary information regarding federal payments in an anti-competitive manner compared to its fintech competitors currently in the marketplace.</blockquote><blockquote>3. Such single-sourced information not available to other market competitors would provide an anti-competitive jump for X Payments LLC on ApplePay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay (mobile wallets) and a host of other fintech companies in the marketplace backed by venture capital and private equity funding.</blockquote><ol start=\"6\"><li><strong>Ability to pick and choose who gets public money, regardless of congressional directives</strong></li></ol><p>I covered the constitutional aspects <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>of this crisis Friday</u></a>.

Without Judicial ability or willingness to sanction Trump &amp; Musk, There is very little left of congress. The “power of the purse” is central to the rule and authority of congress. The decentralized (in relative terms) nature of administrative agencies means that there are enormous opportunities for agencies to follow the law. This is a place to skip past all those headaches.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><ol start=\"7\"><li><strong>Catastrophic failure of the payments system.</strong></li></ol><p>Even a disruption for a day would be a disaster. A disruption on longer timescales would have unimaginable knock on effects. The Treasury could involuntarily default because of operational issues. The worst case scenarios, which are <strong>completely and utterly plausible at the time of writing</strong>, would be a catastrophe without precedent. No typical economic calamity like the Great Financial Crisis or even the Great Depression would be comparable.&nbsp;</p><p>TLDR, here is what I told Norwegian national daily newspaper Klassekampen, one of the largest newspapers in Norway, when asked for comment:</p><blockquote>The reason this is so incredibly important is that the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's payment system sits at the very heart of the United States Federal Government. 88% of government payments, which amounts to about 5.4 Trillion dollars, flows through this system every year and onto the wider economy. Its social security checks, medicare and medicaid payments to medical providers etc. It's everything, in short. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service is the payments intermediary where all payment orders from the various government agencies get routed to their intended recipients. If anything happened to this system, the payments would not go out and that would lead to catastrophe. It could also lead to an unintentional operational default on United States treasury securities.</blockquote><blockquote>It also is an enormous privacy violation where former employees of Musk who have not properly gotten security clearance are able to install insecure technology and steal the most sensitive information possible. They could theoretically use banking information of people they identify as enemies and put them on terror watch lists, or \"do not pay\" lists if they can get enough operational control at the treasury. Part of why this is, as one current Bureau of the Fiscal Service employee described it, apocalyptic is that all the ways that this can be abused are incalculable and would take years to fully map. To the extent that the sudden collapse of the United States would have a negative effect on the rest of the world, this is as much of a global crisis as it is a national one</blockquote><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/Day-Six-of-the-Trump-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025.pdf\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Printer Friendly Version</a></div>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/day-six-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"6fba778a-2151-4e26-8133-c2c3fbece625","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"67a319f119a2b4000196e4a9","reading_time":12}},{"node":{"friendly_date":"February 4","id":"Ghost__Post__67a206e81d9ece00012a83cd","title":"Day Five of the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025: Not “Read Only” access anymore","slug":"day-five-of-the-trump-musk-treasury-payments-crisis-of-2025-not-read-only-access-anymore","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/images/2025/02/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.png","featuredImg":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b80808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/migrantinsider/static/45bf3b6f41b2aea20d23bd2ab35c82fb/a502c/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.png","srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/45bf3b6f41b2aea20d23bd2ab35c82fb/465f1/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.png 400w,\n/migrantinsider/static/45bf3b6f41b2aea20d23bd2ab35c82fb/28b0a/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.png 800w,\n/migrantinsider/static/45bf3b6f41b2aea20d23bd2ab35c82fb/a502c/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.png 1599w","sizes":"(min-width: 1599px) 1599px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/migrantinsider/static/45bf3b6f41b2aea20d23bd2ab35c82fb/dccb0/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.webp 400w,\n/migrantinsider/static/45bf3b6f41b2aea20d23bd2ab35c82fb/35be4/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.webp 800w,\n/migrantinsider/static/45bf3b6f41b2aea20d23bd2ab35c82fb/f8257/Day-Five-of-the-Trum-Musk-Treasury-Payments-Crisis-of-2025-d15c8111570de44a.webp 1599w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1599px) 1599px, 100vw"}]},"width":1599,"height":828}}},"excerpt":"If you are a current or former career Bureau of the Fiscal Service Employee, especially if you’re a legacy IT programmer with years of experience and especially if you are a COBOL programmer currently working on the PAM, SPS or any other adjacent team, contact me over email or over signal — linked here.

The abbreviated version was in Rolling Stone an hour later. I also have done some interviews which have appeared, and one that has not in Marketwatch. I will obviously be doing a ton more interviews as well. My phone and email have been ringing off the proverbial hook for obvious reasons. Here’s what has appeared so far.\n\nAmerican Prospect: ‘Filled With Unmitigated Terror’ A Q&A with Nathan Tankus on what it means for Elon Musk’s forces to have commandeered some level of control of the U.S. payment system.\n\nMajority Report: Elon’s Coup Lights Five-Alarm Plus Fire w/ Nathan Tankus \n\nI am going to state the obvious: Until this crisis is resolved or it fundamentally destroys the ability for economic and social life to continue in the United States, this newsletter is now devoted to this crisis full time. Since reporting and sources which have emerged subsequently to yesterday’s piece which I discuss below, it has become clear that at least some of my worst fears are proving true. Thus I’m officially labeling this crisis the “Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025”. Originally I was going to number this crisis by business days, but as Musk is proudly tweeting about, DOGE is working the weekends. So today is Day 5 of the crisis.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSince I published my article at 6 am yesterday morning, a number of current and former Bureau of the Fiscal Service officials have reached out and unfortunately confirmed the accuracy of my reporting. Both in my understanding of the technical situation and the extreme dangers that the access which had been reported up to that point. All thought read only access was extraordinarily dangerous to the country. Unfortunately, my sources also tell me that the subsequent anonymous sources mainstream journalists reported who worked to downplay the situation are not accurate.\n\nWired beat me to the punch of reporting that a top DOGE employee, 25 year old former SpaceX employee Marko Elez, has not only read but write access to BFS servers. What can I say, I had to sleep and my sources messaged me after I was asleep. Their article is entitled “A 25-Year-Old With Elon Musk Ties Has Direct Access to the Federal Payment System”, my sources have also independently (and before publication of the Wire article at 1 AM today) confirmed their reporting that:\n\nTwo of those sources say that Elez’s privileges include the ability not just to read but to write code on two of the most sensitive systems in the US government: The Payment Automation Manager (PAM) and Secure Payment System (SPS) at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). Housed on a top-secret mainframe, these systems control, on a granular level, government payments that in their totality amount to more than a fifth of the US economy. [...]\n\nTypically, those admin privileges could give someone the power to log into servers through secure shell access, navigate the entire file system, change user permissions, and delete or modify critical files. That could allow someone to bypass the security measures of, and potentially cause irreversible changes to, the very systems they have access to. [...]\n\n\"Technically I don't see why this couldn't happen,\" a federal IT worker tells WIRED in a phone call late on Monday night, referring to the possibility of a DOGE employee being granted elevated access to a government server. \"If you would have asked me a week ago, I'd have told you that this kind of thing would never in a million years happen. But now, who the fuck knows.\"\n\nAll of this is absolutely true according to my sources.\n\nAdditionally, I can exclusively report that while there was initial hesitation from “IT Leadership” to give them access, they relented. However, they still believed this was extremely risky with one member of leadership saying “I’ve never done anything like this before”, according to a source familiar with the situation. A current IT employee of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service told me “This level of unchecked access is critically dangerous to the economy and the government”. When I replied “this is terrifying” to being informed that they have “write access” this source replied “Yeah it's not good. Read privileges on its own still would have left room for catastrophe, but read and write is apocalyptic.”\n\nSubscribe\n\nIt is as of yet unclear whether anyone on the Payment Automation Manager (PAM) system or the “Secured Payment System” (SPS) have been put on “paid administrative leave”, coerced into resigning or quit in protest. All that is known is that Marko can “access and query” SPS and that there was someone who gave Marko a “tour” of the facilities. We do not know where they are in operationalizing any control. One senior IT source can see Mark retrieving “close to a thousand rows of data” but they can’t see the content because the system is “top secret” even to them. No source I have has knowledge of what DOGE is doing with the data they are retrieving. \n\nOne source states that IT is “mostly intact” but expects that to change as the return to work mandate comes into effect and/or DOGE starts doing even worse things. To be clear, IT is separate from the COBOL programmers who work specifically on these legacy systems. There have certainly been some number of “less than voluntary” resignations similar to Fiscal Assistant Secretary Lebryk. The only outright firings were of the Economic Equality and Opportunity team which one source found “insanely concerning” since that desegregation and anti-discrimination office has been in every federal agency since 1965. The war on “DEI” in the Federal Government is really a war to rollback desegregation and anti-discrimination protections created by the Civil Rights Acts and is not simply some attack on 2010s non-profit trends as it is often portrayed as. But that’s a whole other story.\n\nOne source explicitly said that they were only reporting to me because there was no one left in the Federal Government to report security breaches to:\n\nI do not wish to harm my agency in any way. I loved working here. We did some of the most important work in the country and barely anyone knew who we were. In normal times, I would report insider threats to the appropriate security channels inside the government- but there is no one left for me to report it to.\n\nThus, my sources have unfortunately confirmed many of my worst fears about this situation.\n\nSubscribe\n\nI would also like to clarify some confusion on social media. The issue with understanding and grasping a COBOL system is not knowing COBOL, as a programming language, in the abstract. Nor is it, god help me, something that AI can “do” because you fired one of these chatbots up and got some code that could compile when you asked “write me some COBOL code”. The issue is understanding the specific physical limitations of the system, the way that it interacts with the “Business Logic” of the code and a million other contextual factors. \n\nThere is specific code which tells you where to direct specific payments in specific ways and the structures, and why they are structured the way they are, requires deep contextual knowledge. This is “business logic”. The entire issue with COBOL and why it has been such a struggle to maintain it is that COBOL systems (both private and public) developed for decades with very little documentation, have a million different path dependent coding choices. Mar Hicks 2020 article in Logic Magazine “Built to Last” is worth a read on this topic.\n\nThis is what I meant yesterday when I referenced that 30 different COBOL systems at Treasury had developed their own “dialects” and they launched Payment Application Modernization (PAM), which among other things, unified them. What they unified was the business logic of those systems (as well as likely other factors, most notably the physical architecture of the systems they ran on). Part of me wishes they didn’t modernize with PAM because those 30 different and distinct systems would have been more secure from their infiltration. PAM processed 4.7 trillion dollars of payments in 2024.\n\nIt's also true that some similar issues can emerge with other more recent programming languages and the way “business logic” emerges if a mission critical IT system developed using a more recent programming language. But COBOL is unique; after all it's literally “common business-oriented language”. So while knowing the COBOL programming language is better than not knowing it, it does not make that much of a difference with these young Musk programmers mucking about. \n\nLarge established businesses and governments do not have a “COBOL programmer” shortage. They have a “COBOL programmer with experience in legacy business or government IT systems” shortage. There’s a reason that the vast majority of legacy IT COBOL programmers had no objection to me using “knowing COBOL” as a shorthand for all this. They do not think of “COBOL” as just the programming language in the abstract, but all these contexts. This miscommunication and difference in mindset is why there is so much mutual misunderstanding between legacy IT programmers and the modern tech industry. The misunderstanding is primarily on the modern tech industry’s part. \n\nWe are in such a catastrophic situation I do not have the words to describe. It is getting worse and very little is being done. Lawsuits have been launched to stop this on privacy grounds, but we need so much more. Strongly worded letters from congress are not enough. There is a protest at the Treasury today. This is not a newsletter to tell you how to organize or engage in political action. But wherever you are, whatever your context, get involved in resisting the Trump’s administration’s catastrophic lawlessness and destruction. And get the word out about the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025, which is the crisis above all the crises happening concurrently. I wish my newsletter’s name were a little less literally true right now.\n\n\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><em>If you are a <strong>current or former career Bureau of the Fiscal Service Employee</strong>, especially if you’re a legacy IT programmer with years of experience<strong> and especially if you are a COBOL programmer currently working on the PAM, SPS or any other adjacent team,</strong> contact me </em><a href=\"mailto:crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><em><u>over email</u></em></a><em> or over signal — </em><a href=\"https://signal.me/?ref=crisesnotes.com#eu/TJspTqx16dD39zG7EKpRYYli9_GTNen7cEL7sAug9gdsPRAdW41JzIywiy5y3lXF\"><em><u>linked here</u></em></a><em>.

Things aren’t going well.” I’m sure to some readers, these statements came off as “alarmist.” \n\nAs it turns out, I understated the extremity and danger of the situation we’re in even as a Judge on Friday issued a more comprehensive injunction against the executive orders which were designed to impound funds, OMB guidance or not, across the federal government. I also understated all the things ordinary Americans are in “danger” of learning about. It's now not just the “legal plumbing,” it's the payments plumbing too. This is now also the closest thing we’ve ever had to a payment system constitutional crisis.\n\nSo what happened? According to reporting on Friday — first at the Washington Post and then in more detail from CNN as well as the New York Times — the Fiscal Assistant Secretary of the United States Treasury David Lebryk has been put on paid administrative leave and plans to resign after refusing to give Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) access to the operational details of the Treasury’s payment system and the data it processes. In particular, Musk’s DOGE team has been asking for what the New York Times reporting refers to as “source code information” since December and has been rebuffed. The CNN reporting specifically states that they were inquiring about the technical ability to stop payments.\n\nDavid Lebryk has been an employee at the United States Treasury since 1989 and has been Fiscal Assistant Treasury Secretary since 2014, which is the highest position a civil service employee can reach; everyone above him is a political appointee. Donald Trump named Lebryk acting Treasury Secretary while his nominee Scott Bessent went through the nominations process; as of this writing Lebryk is still listed on the Treasury’s website as the acting Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. His understanding of the operational systems that undergird the functioning of the United States Treasury is far and away unparalleled. In particular, he is widely credited with being the person who is overwhelmingly responsible for the undisrupted continuity of cash inflows and outflows at the Treasury during the recurrent debt ceiling crises of the past 15 years while concurrently ensuring the debt ceiling limit was not breached.\n\nLebryk being put on paid administrative leave reportedly happened after he requested and got a meeting with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, fresh from his confirmation by the Senate. Bessent’s full willingness to cooperate with DOGE’s desire to access the operational aspects of the Treasury’s payment system, even to the point of overruling Lebryk, is an extremely shocking development. It implies a level of willingness to serve Trump’s interests that has not previously been understood by Congress, Wall Street, or corporate America at-large. \n\nHowever, this is consistent with internal conversations among those in the president’s orbit. I can exclusively report here for the first time that Scott Bessent was advised that what Donald Trump wanted in a Treasury Secretary was a person who would have the credibility Steve Mnuchin had with Wall Street but who would be loyal to Trump above all other considerations, according to two sources familiar with the situation. This included, but was not limited to, unconditionally agreeing to work with whomever Trump sent over to the Treasury Department and helping go after Donald Trump’s enemies. In the context of Bessent’s actions this week, and what Elon Musk and DOGE want from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, these commitments take on a dark new meaning. \n\nSubscribe\n\nThe danger is also not in the near future, it is here. Follow up reporting from the New York Times Saturday evening in an article straightforwardly informed readers in its headline that “Elon Musk’s Team Now Has Full Access to Treasury’s Payments System.” They could not initially confirm that any payments had yet been stopped but an updated version had further information that seemed intended by anonymous government officials to reassure people. Most notably, the New York Times took the word “full” out of the headline:\n\nWhile their access was approved, the Musk representatives have yet to gain operational capabilities and no government payments have been blocked, the people said.\n\nMr. Musk’s initiative is intended to be part of a broader review of the payments system to allow improper payments to be scrutinized and is not an effort to arbitrarily block individual payments, the people familiar with the matter said. Career Treasury Department attorneys signed off on granting the access, they added, and any changes to the system would go through a review process and testing.\n\nFor reasons I will go into below, I do believe that it is the case that Musk and his team are not yet near having “operational capabilities.” The key word is “yet.”\n\nHowever, I find the Times reporters willingness to uncritically repeat Musk’s stated rationale for operational access extremely troubling and certainly unconvincing. I do not think Musk’s stated rationale has any additional credibility because it was repeated by anonymous Treasury officials. It's important to understand that “improper” is in the eye of the beholder, and the danger of operational access to the payments system is precisely that there are very little safeguards for its improper use or manipulation. It turns out that the greatest barrier was David Lebryk, and he was shunted aside at the direct order of the White House. We also have no idea what circumstances, or even if it is true, that “Career Treasury Department attorneys signed off.” It’s also far-fetched they aren’t pursuing using this to block payments since the impoundment constitutional crisis has not been resolved. They absolutely can shut down payments from a disfavored agency even if they can’t shut down “individual” payments operationally.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubsequent reporting from Politico and the Wall Street Journal had more plausible details. The Wall Street Journal states:\n\nA person familiar with the arrangement said DOGE representatives won’t have direct authority to stop individual payments or make other changes, describing their access as “read only.” Bessent approved the arrangement on the condition that the DOGE representatives’ activity be documented and monitored. \n\nTom Krause, a Musk ally and the chief executive at Cloud Software Group, led the discussions with Treasury over the arrangement, the person said. Krause, who is working with DOGE, is among those expected to gain access to the system.\n\nThus, the “comforting” narrative here is that Elon Musk’s representative, who now is technically a Treasury employee as well, has allegedly not been granted unconditional access. However, the point of “read only” access is to make changes through understanding the code. There is no reason to think at this moment that DOGE’s proposed modifications would be resisted by Scott Bessent. Until new information emerges the best sign of what’s going on is Lebryk being forced out. It will take much more evidence of an ironclad legal review process before I am convinced otherwise (to say the least). The internal treasury payments systems must function correctly; it just also matters what purposes it is being designed for. \n\nMusk and his cronies are clearly aiming to redesign the payments system to serve their agenda. The most chilling sentence is this one from the Wall Street Journal:\n\nIt couldn’t be determined what DOGE representatives intended to do with their access to the payment system. Musk and his team think the payment system should be overseen by political appointees selected by President Trump, the people said.\n\nThis is not the attitude of people who are trying to simply technocratically make the payment system more “efficient.” They have a very clear and specific agenda, which involves unilaterally cutting spending, particularly spending they perceive to be going to their ideological foes. Is “Wokeness,” the “Green New Deal,” “Marxism,” and “Gender Ideology” going to be the new definition of an “improper payment\"?\n\nWhich brings me back to the Constitutional Crisis. As I published on Friday Morning, this was already a constitutional crisis because the Trump administration was claiming sweeping powers to impound spending, pulling the purse-strings away from Congress and towards itself. The executive orders were shock-enforced with a sudden Office of Management Budget memo last Monday with the deadline for implementation being 24 hours later. The vagueness and sweeping nature of the order led to payment portals going down across the Federal Government. The backlash got the OMB memo rescinded, but not the executive orders. There are now multiple court injunctions.\n\nSubscribe\n\nIt is crucial to understand that while this was already very bad, it is not as bad as it could have been. Online web-based payment portals went down because agencies either took them down themselves or directed the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to do so while they figured out how they were going to deal with the OMB guidance. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s job is to keep the payments system functioning and they follow what agencies tell them to do, within the scope of the law as they understand it. If someone commits fraud, it's law enforcement or the agencies themselves job to catch it before or after a payment is made. \n\nWhich brings me to this idea that operational access to the Treasury’s payment system is about “improper payments.” Musk took to Twitter at 1:52 AM on Saturday to frame David Lebryk’s “resignation” around a supposed shock that the Bureau of the Fiscal Service fulfills all valid payment orders that it gets from administrative agencies. His exact statement was:\n\nThe @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. \n\nThey literally never denied a payment in their entire career. \n\nNot even once.\n\nIt is of course not the case that they approve payments to “known fraudulent or terrorist groups.” It is true that greater matching between specific data across the federal government, as well as state and local governments, would reduce improper payments before they become valid payment orders processed by the Treasury.\n\nThe Bureau of the Fiscal Service has a “payments integrity unit” which works with agencies to reduce improper payments, and the BFS offered no less than five legislative proposals in its fiscal year 2024 report for improving the payments system and reducing improper payments. These proposals focus precisely on greater access to datasets across government (and credit reporting data) as well as giving the Treasury greater authority to require agencies to engage in bank-account matching in order to reduce improper payments. Note that they are legislative proposals because these require statutory authorization and cannot legally be done unilaterally. They would also cost money to enact, which requires appropriations. Conversely, if an agency is illegally not paying someone who should be paid, it is the responsibility of the Judiciary, Congress or oversight bodies in the executive branch to deal with this problem. \n\nIt’s also important to understand that “improper payment” does not simply mean “fraud.” There are a multitude of reasons for why over or underpayments can happen. The main issue is improving internal controls at agencies, increasing agency funding so they can do a better job with this and delegate less administration to entities like state governments. Indeed among the “highest risk” programs for improper payments are programs where individual benefits are administered at the state level. In the 2024 fiscal year the Treasury’s internal payments system processed 1.4 billion payments with an aggregate monetary value of $5.4 trillion. This is 88 percent of the total payments the federal government makes. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service is the pulsating payments heart of the entire federal government. The point is not to pick and choose at this level, just as you don’t screen which apartment buildings are connected to sewer and water lines based on “suspicious activity reports” about their occupants.  \n\nIt is not the job of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to do the due diligence others were supposed to with a tiny staff that has an enormous task. Nor is discretionarily stopping payments at the operational payments level remotely consistent with even the barest minimum standard of due process of law. What their job is is to serve as a payments intermediary between the rest of the Federal Government and the wider payments system by routing payments to recipients through the Federal Reserve and onto the banking system. This BFS “user training” powerpoint for the “Automated Standard Application for Payments,” for example, has a helpful guide to how this works with some useful diagrams.\n\nThis is the absolutely crucial part. Without political control of the payment's heart, the Trump administration and Elon Musk must chase down every agency and bend it to their will. They are in the process of doing that, but bureaucrats can notionally continue to respect the law and resist their efforts. They are helped in this effort by court injunctions they can point to. This is bureaucratic trench warfare. But if Musk and Trump can reach into the choke point, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, they could possibly not need agency cooperation. They can just impound agency payments themselves. They could also possibly stop paying federal employees they have forced on paid administrative leave, coercing them to resign. These possibilities are what every Treasury expert I’ve talked to instantly thought of the moment they read the Washington Post reporting and are incredibly alarmed about.\n\nSubscribe\n\nWhich brings me to why legislative changes are needed to modify the data the Bureau of the Fiscal Service collects. The central reason is privacy. The data the Treasury collects could not possibly be more sensitive. We are talking about hundreds of millions of Social Security numbers, as well as a raft of other specific identifying information. In fact, the Privacy Impact Statements (PIAs) on the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s website are the best way an outsider can find out information about how the Treasury’s internal payment system works in general. I have gotten into looking at Private Impact Statements over the past year in order to find information I could FOIA. Social Security payments, among many others, flow through the “Secured Payment System” (SPS).\n\nLet's return to the “Automated Standard Application for Payments” (ASAP) for a second to examine its Privacy Impact Statement. ASAP specifically allows agencies to send funds to “state and local governments, educational and financial institutions, vendors and contractors, profit and non-profit entities and Indian tribal organizations.” This system collects between “10,000 – 99,999” social security numbers along with identifying “business” information, including sensitive financial records and “business” bank accounts. Does anyone think that if Musk could get his hands on this information, whether directly or indirectly, he would not use it to go after, say, nonprofits he dislikes? At 3:14am Sunday, Musk pledged to shut down \"illegal payments\" to Global Refuge, a faith-based organization that exists to provide \"safety and support to refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants from across the world.\" Musk messing with ASAP is no hypothetical at all.\n\nCrucially, the PIA form asks this question:\n\nIs it possible that Treasury will share information maintained in the system or by the project with a third party external to the Department that will use the information to make an adverse determination about an individual’s rights, benefits, and privileges under federal programs? [Emphasis added]\n\nThe form documenting ASAP marks “no.” In many ways, the United States functions — to the extent it functions — because across hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Privacy Impact Statements agencies answer this question “no” and then follow through — for the most part — on this answer. If people come to believe that any information they provide the Federal Government will be a token granting Donald Trump and Elon Musk greater power over them, a multitude of essential functions will fall apart.\n\nTo someone like Musk, I think the idea that there is information held on Treasury or other governmental servers which could theoretically be used to uncover “improper payments” or other such alleged irregularities and this information cannot be used because of legal privacy protections will make no sense. He will rail on about how he’s trying to stop “fraud” but the “deep state” won’t let him. The best of the Federal Government comes when civil service employees maintain and defend privacy against the parts of the government which wants to abuse this information against our interests. The Civil Service does not always live up to that, especially when congress passes laws that encroach on privacy and mandate or allow the use of governmental data against us. But it remains heroic when people like David Lebryk get in the way of that, especially when it means being pushed out of government.\n\nIn some ways, as enormously alarming at this all is, it’s somehow not the biggest concern that I have been thinking about. For the past 36 hours (writing these words at Midnight on Saturday) my mind has returned over and over to the idea that they have been asking for “source code information” to the Treasury’s internal payments system. The concept of Elon Musk asking for the Treasury payments system’s “source code” would make any veteran of legacy mission critical IT laugh hysterically, and  then perhaps weep. \n\nSubscribe\n\nAnyone who knows or has known computer programmers of mission critical legacy IT systems can tell you about the stories of rafts of consultants who have come and gone attempting to understand how the system works so they can “modernize” it on the cheap. The vast majority of the time these consultants are either not able to do what they promise or are honest about the cost of updating the system without a mission critical system “going down,” leading management to balk. The modernization of the United States Treasury’s legacy IT systems was started almost 20 years ago with Payment Application Modernization (PAM). The scale and difficulty of this can be judged by reading the description of the… Post Payment Modernization Initiative (PPMI):\n\nThe purpose of the Post Payment Modernization Initiative (PPMI) application is to consolidate all post-payment processing into one comprehensive application by merging processing currently performed by multiple legacy systems. The consolidation of post payment systems will reduce costs associated with operations & maintenance of legacy systems, reduce duplicative functionality, eliminate redundancy of data across systems & provide a single source for post payment processing for Treasury Disbursed Federal agencies. Initial Production Deployment of the PPMI application will be used to run in parallel with the legacy systems PPMI will be consolidating. [Emphasis added]\n\nIn other words, they are doing the payments modernization after the payments modernization and this second phase is still ongoing. And who knows if there would be a third phase.\n\nIt’s hard to get good information on the exact state of play of the treasury payments system’s IT modernization. The clearest indication actually comes from a September 2024 press release about the IRS: \n\nFor 65 years, the IRS has relied on the same foundational technology for many of its critical systems, including the Individual Master File (IMF), which houses taxpayer data and feeds into key systems. The core technology, based on ALC and COBOL coding, has become a liability due to the diminishing pool of experts proficient in this legacy language.\n\nThe IRS has reached a critical milestone in modernizing a core technology component of the Individual Master File, by porting the outdated Assembly-based codebase to Java, a more modern, more sustainable language. Reflecting the agency’s focus on technology best practices, this new system, Integrated Tax Processing Engine (ITPE), is now running simultaneously with IMF to verify accuracy of its data processing. The system's data will be hosted in the Enterprise Data Platform, a modern, cloud-based system for managing data.\n\nTo translate, this is a press release celebrating moving some of the IRS’ systems off Assembly, a mainframe coding language invented in 1947. \n\nSubscribe\n\nCOBOL is the lingua franca of mission critical legacy IT in use since the 1960s and too many systems have been too important to abandon it. “Modernization” has instead been built around making COBOL function somewhere besides a mainframe. The “modernization” of the Treasury’s IT payments infrastructure seems to have constituted a combination of rooting out Assembly code and a basically completed transition of “mainframe” COBOL to an “internally-developed RM COBOL” running on Linux servers. RM COBOL is an update on mainframe COBOL “designed for optimum performance and wide portability across a broad diversity of computers and operating systems.” Most notably, the Treasury’s transition to RM COBOL seems to have involved harmonizing more than 30 different COBOL systems which had evolved separately. It was 30 “dialects” they managed to get to speak one standardized language. \n\nDoes Elon Musk understand any of this? Does he have any grasp of the scale and complexity he is trying to reach into and exercise “influence”? Currently the most urgent and profound danger is not what he intends to make this sprawling apparatus do. The most immediate danger is what might break in the process of trying to get this apparatus to do what he wants.  \n\nAt every step of modernizing this system they have run systems concurrently to make sure the “new” functions as well as the old. Redundant systems are only phased out over long time periods after they have enough data on system functioning to feel confident in the “modernized” infrastructure. This is expensive, time consuming and absolutely necessary to make sure this system functions 100% of the time. Elon Musk, however, has never shown respect or understanding of the concept of a mission critical IT system. All he sees is “inefficiency” because he doesn’t understand that there are some things in this world that need to function no matter what and you spend the additional money to make sure it runs, including when it's being updated. \n\nThis is ultimately not that big a deal when it comes to Twitter — Twitter can go down for a few hours, even a few days. Its function can degrade over time and the website can become less and less usable on a gradual — and then maybe eventually sudden — way down. A worse disruption would be more painful, but ultimately not a crisis for the world. The same cannot be said about the complex and sprawling legacy IT systems and administrative apparatus which make sure that Treasury payments go out, are on time and never fail. To put that another way, the same cannot be said about the system that makes sure the federal government is able to make payments reliably and on time. \n\nIt's also important to state that the number of people who comprehensively understand these legacy IT systems can likely be counted on two hands — and that may be optimistic. It is already a threat to their Mission Critical nature for David Lebryk to be forced out of the Federal Government by Elon Musk. Lebryk, who first joined the Treasury Department in 1989 and slowly worked his way up until he was its highest ranking non-political appointee, is clearly the person on earth who understands this IT apparatus the best. Having known his equivalents on far smaller and less important scales in other legacy IT systems, I can tell you that there are certainly things about this IT system that he knows and no one else does. \n\nFurthermore, it's possible that he is the only person on earth that fully understands how all the many components of how these sprawling legacy IT systems — really a legacy IT “network” — fits together and interacts. I’m sure the knowledge of the remaining career service professionals at the Treasury can combine their understanding to approximate most of Lebryk’s knowledge, but there is a reason you have and value someone like Lebryk in the first place. Companies have spent millions of dollars hiring back such people to fix mission critical IT systems of far, far less importance. \n\nI try to keep emotion out of this newsletter. I have always tried to write Notes on the Crises in a calm, detached tone so that the information I highlight shines through. However, I must be honest with readers: I’m absolutely terrified. When I first read the Washington Post’s reporting I subsequently had a panic attack. I am not subject to those. I didn’t have one during the start of Covid-19 when I started writing about the full health, economic, and political consequences in March 2020 and knew before many, many people that millions would die. Nor at any time subsequently did I have one. Even as someone who has spent an unusual amount of time thinking about the Treasury’s internal payments system for a person who has never been in government, I find grasping the full implications of Elon Musk and his apparatchiks reaching into and trying to exert full control over the Treasury’s payment system mind-boggling. \n\nThere is nothing more important on the entire planet than getting Elon Musk and DOGE out of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service and allowing career civil service employees to run the Treasury’s internal payments system without capricious and self-serving interference from billionaires and their allies. This effort must fail if we are to safeguard any semblance of due process and lawfulness in the executive branch. A vague anonymous promise that DOGE only has “read only” access is not enough. They need to be rooted out so that we can return to the slower moving, less dangerous, “five alarm fire” constitutional crisis we were having as of Friday morning.\n\nSubscribePrinter Friendly Version","html":"<p><em>If you are a <strong>current or former career </strong>“<strong>civil service</strong>”<strong> Treasury or Federal Reserve System employee,</strong> including in the general counsel’s offices of either entity, and you have detailed knowledge of how the Bureau of Fiscal Service operates at an operational level please contact me </em><a href=\"mailto:crisesnotes@gmail.com\"><em><u>over email</u></em></a><em> or over signal — </em><a href=\"https://signal.me/?ref=crisesnotes.com#eu/TJspTqx16dD39zG7EKpRYYli9_GTNen7cEL7sAug9gdsPRAdW41JzIywiy5y3lXF\"><em><u>linked here</u></em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>This is a free piece of Notes on the Crises.

However, the point of “read only” access is to make changes through understanding the code. There is no reason to think at this moment that DOGE’s proposed modifications would be resisted by Scott Bessent. Until new information emerges the best sign of what’s going on is Lebryk being forced out. It will take much more evidence of an ironclad legal review process before I am convinced otherwise (to say the least). The internal treasury payments systems must <strong>function correctly</strong>; it just also matters what purposes it is being <strong>designed for</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Musk and his cronies are clearly aiming to redesign the payments system to serve their agenda. The most chilling sentence is this one from <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/elon-musks-doge-getting-access-to-payment-system-that-doles-out-trillions-to-americans-5625adf0?st=EurALG&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the Wall Street Journal</u></a>: </p><blockquote>It couldn’t be determined what DOGE representatives intended to do with their access to the payment system.

Is “Wokeness,” the “Green New Deal,” “Marxism,” and “Gender Ideology” going to be the new definition of an “improper payment\"?</p><p>Which brings me back to the Constitutional Crisis. <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>As I published on Friday Morning</u></a>, this was already a constitutional crisis because the Trump administration was claiming sweeping powers to impound spending, pulling the purse-strings away from Congress and towards itself. The executive orders were shock-enforced with a sudden Office of Management Budget memo last Monday with the deadline for implementation being 24 hours later. The vagueness and sweeping nature of the order led to payment portals going down across the Federal Government. The backlash got the OMB memo rescinded, but not the executive orders. There are now multiple court injunctions.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>It is crucial to understand that while this was already very bad, it is not <strong>as bad</strong> as it could have been. Online web-based payment portals went down because agencies either took them down themselves or directed the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to do so while they figured out how they were going to deal with the OMB guidance. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s job is to keep the payments system functioning and they follow what agencies tell them to do, within the scope of the law as they understand it. If someone commits fraud, it's law enforcement or the agencies themselves job to catch it before or after a payment is made.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfu2vCS-XHvtO8dfa7RUu1bvoSC6-53fGV3s0aM0xaJe-ZyxcXBEPoHCPonSKBmlkeNI4vOwiPIGKsxtTE58w2lT6qx8BFsSGmh9qgH8LtqZY--UAz9GWnHb_CxzV5XIXohpXU-sg?key=QA6wVkEWKRJl8cVUW10WZ7Wo\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"450\" height=\"743\"></figure><p>Which brings me to this idea that operational access to the Treasury’s payment system is about “improper payments.” Musk took to Twitter at 1:52 AM on Saturday to frame David Lebryk’s “resignation” around a supposed shock that the Bureau of the Fiscal Service fulfills all valid payment orders that it gets from administrative agencies. His exact <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1885582076247712229?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>statement was</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>They literally never denied a payment in their entire career.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Not even once.</blockquote><p>It is of course not the case that they approve payments to “known fraudulent or terrorist groups.” It is true that greater matching between specific data across the federal government, as well as state and local governments, would reduce improper payments <strong>before they become valid payment orders processed by the Treasury.</strong></p><p>The Bureau of the Fiscal Service has a<strong> “payments integrity unit”</strong> which works with agencies to reduce improper payments, and the BFS offered no less than <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/15.-FiscalService-FY2024-BIB.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>five legislative proposals in its fiscal year 2024 report</u></a> for improving the payments system and reducing improper payments. These proposals focus precisely on greater access to datasets across government (and credit reporting data) as well as giving the Treasury greater authority to require agencies to engage in bank-account matching in order to reduce improper payments. Note that they are <strong>legislative proposals</strong> because these require statutory authorization and cannot legally be done unilaterally. They would also cost money to enact, which requires appropriations. Conversely, if an agency is illegally not paying someone who should be paid, it is the responsibility of the Judiciary, Congress or oversight bodies in the executive branch to deal with this problem.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also important to understand that <strong>“improper payment” </strong><a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/830/820358.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><strong><u>does not simply mean “fraud.”</u></strong></a> There are a multitude of reasons for why over or underpayments can happen. The main issue is improving internal controls at agencies, increasing agency funding so they can do a better job with this and delegate less administration to entities like state governments. Indeed among the “highest risk” programs for improper payments <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/830/820358.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>are programs where individual benefits are administered at the state level</u></a>. In the 2024 fiscal year the Treasury’s internal payments system <strong>processed 1.4 billion payments with an aggregate monetary value of $5.4 trillion. </strong>This is 88 percent of the total payments the federal government makes. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service is the pulsating payments heart of the entire federal government. The point is <strong>not to pick and choose at this level</strong>, just as you don’t screen which apartment buildings are connected to sewer and water lines based on “suspicious activity reports” about their occupants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is not the job of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to do the due diligence others were supposed to with a tiny staff that has an enormous task. Nor is discretionarily stopping payments at the operational payments level remotely consistent with even the barest minimum standard of due process of law. What their job is is to serve as a <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/banks-as-payment-plumbing-monetary/\"><u>payments intermediary</u></a> between the rest of the Federal Government and the wider payments system by routing payments to recipients through the Federal Reserve and onto the banking system. This <a href=\"https://archive.ph/ChM4l?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>BFS “user training” powerpoint</u></a> for the “Automated Standard Application for Payments,” for example, has a helpful guide to how this works with some useful diagrams. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfcERyUfV7jc3kCVzhAqDwcvhChpQmdANjUQXYc3qcfOO-mocY0IgEedMW96JhH540P4MXEm7Ty-ML54s8ql8156LpzauHYcyBLTnOUyiiJE8LyYkhMeMBWS89QN9nZjhvn9Ld0?key=QA6wVkEWKRJl8cVUW10WZ7Wo\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"313\"></figure><p>This is the absolutely <strong>crucial part. </strong>Without political control of the payment's heart, the Trump administration and Elon Musk must chase down every agency and bend it to their will. They are in the process of doing that, but bureaucrats can notionally continue to respect the law and resist their efforts. They are helped in this effort by court injunctions they can point to. This is bureaucratic trench warfare. But if Musk and Trump can reach into the choke point, the<strong> Bureau of the Fiscal Service,</strong> they could possibly <strong>not need</strong> agency cooperation. They can just <strong>impound agency payments themselves</strong>. They could also possibly <strong>stop paying federal employees they have forced on paid administrative leave, coercing them to resign</strong>. These possibilities are what every Treasury expert I’ve talked to instantly thought of the moment they read the Washington Post reporting and are incredibly alarmed about.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Which brings me to <strong>why</strong> legislative changes are needed to modify the data the Bureau of the Fiscal Service collects. The central reason is <strong>privacy</strong>. The data the Treasury collects could not possibly <strong>be more sensitive.</strong> We are talking about hundreds<strong> of millions of Social Security numbers, as well as a raft of other specific identifying information</strong>. In fact, the <a href=\"https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/pia.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Privacy Impact Statements (PIAs)</u></a> on the Bureau of the Fiscal Service’s website are the best way an outsider can find out information about how the Treasury’s internal payment system works in general. I have gotten into looking at Private Impact Statements over the past year in order to find information I could FOIA. Social Security payments, among many others, flow through <a href=\"https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/files/pia/spspclia.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>the “Secured Payment System” (SPS)</u></a>.</p><p>Let's return to the “Automated Standard Application for Payments” (ASAP) for a second to <a href=\"https://archive.ph/gJRL7?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>examine its Privacy Impact Statement</u></a>. ASAP specifically allows agencies to <a href=\"https://fiscal.treasury.gov/asap/?ref=crisesnotes.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">send funds to</a> “state and local governments, educational and financial institutions, vendors and contractors, profit and non-profit entities and Indian tribal organizations.” This system collects between “10,000 – 99,999” social security numbers along with identifying “business” information, including sensitive financial records and “business” bank accounts. Does anyone think that if Musk could get his hands on this information, whether directly or indirectly, he would not use it to go after, say, nonprofits he dislikes? At <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1885964969335808217?s=46&ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>3:14am Sunday, Musk pledged</u></a> to shut down \"illegal payments\" to <a href=\"https://2023.globalrefuge.org/?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Global Refuge</u></a>, a faith-based organization that exists to provide \"safety and support to refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants from across the world.\" Musk messing with ASAP is no hypothetical at all.</p><p>Crucially, the PIA form asks this question:</p><blockquote>Is it possible that Treasury will share information maintained in the system or by the project <strong>with a third party external to the Department that will use the information</strong> to make an adverse determination about an individual’s rights, benefits, and privileges under federal programs? [Emphasis added]</blockquote><p>The form documenting ASAP marks “no.” In many ways, the United States functions — to the extent it functions — because across hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Privacy Impact Statements agencies answer this question “no” and then follow through — for the most part — on this answer. If people come to believe that any information they provide the Federal Government will be a token granting Donald Trump and Elon Musk greater power over them, a multitude of essential functions will fall apart.</p><p>To someone like Musk, I think the idea that there is information held on Treasury or other governmental servers which could theoretically be used to uncover “improper payments” or other such alleged irregularities and this information cannot be used because of legal privacy protections will make no sense. He will rail on about how he’s trying to stop “fraud” but the “deep state” won’t let him. The best of the Federal Government comes when civil service employees maintain and defend privacy against the parts of the government which wants to abuse this information against our interests. The Civil Service does not always live up to that, especially when congress passes laws that encroach on privacy and mandate or allow the use of governmental data against us. But it remains heroic when people like David Lebryk get in the way of that, especially when it means being pushed out of government.</p><p>In some ways, as enormously alarming at this all is, it’s somehow not the biggest concern that I have been thinking about. For the past 36 hours (writing these words at Midnight on Saturday) my mind has returned over and over to the idea that they have been asking for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/david-lebryk-treasury-resigns-musk.html?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“source code information</u></a>” to the Treasury’s internal payments system. The concept of Elon Musk asking for the Treasury payments system’s “source code” would make any veteran of legacy mission critical IT laugh hysterically, and&nbsp; then perhaps weep.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Anyone who knows or has known computer programmers of mission critical legacy IT systems can tell you about the stories of rafts of consultants who have come and gone attempting to understand how the system works so they can “modernize” it on the cheap. The vast majority of the time these consultants are either not able to do what they promise or are honest about the cost of updating the system without a mission critical system “going down,” leading management to balk. The modernization of the United States Treasury’s legacy IT systems was started almost 20 years ago with <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/10_FMS_CJ_01-22-07_GTG.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Payment Application Modernization (PAM)</u></a>. The scale and difficulty of this can be judged by reading the description of the… <a href=\"https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/files/pia/ppmi-pclia.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>Post Payment Modernization Initiative (PPMI)</u></a>:</p><blockquote>The purpose of the Post Payment Modernization Initiative (PPMI) application is to consolidate all post-payment processing into one comprehensive application by<strong> merging processing currently performed by multiple legacy systems</strong>. The consolidation of post payment systems will reduce costs associated with <strong>operations &amp; maintenance of legacy systems, reduce duplicative functionality, eliminate redundancy of data across systems &amp; provide a single source for post payment processing</strong> for Treasury Disbursed Federal agencies. Initial Production Deployment of the PPMI application will be used to run in parallel with the legacy systems PPMI will be consolidating. [Emphasis added]</blockquote><p>In other words, they are doing the payments modernization after the payments modernization and this second phase is still ongoing. And who knows if there would be a third phase.</p><p>It’s hard to get good information on the exact state of play of the treasury payments system’s IT modernization. The clearest indication actually comes from a <a href=\"https://archive.ph/478AG?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>September 2024 press release</u></a> about the IRS:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><strong>For 65 years</strong>, the IRS has relied on the same foundational technology for many of its critical systems, including the Individual Master File (IMF), which houses taxpayer data and feeds into key systems. The core technology, <strong>based on ALC and COBOL coding</strong>, has become a liability due to the <strong>diminishing pool of experts proficient in this legacy language</strong>.</blockquote><blockquote>The IRS has reached a critical milestone in modernizing a core technology component of the Individual Master File, by <strong>porting the outdated Assembly-based codebase to Java</strong>, a more modern, more sustainable language. Reflecting the agency’s focus on technology best practices, this new system, Integrated Tax Processing Engine (ITPE), is now running simultaneously with IMF to verify accuracy of its data processing. The system's data will be hosted in the Enterprise Data Platform, a modern, cloud-based system for managing data.</blockquote><p>To translate, this is a press release celebrating moving <strong>some</strong> of the IRS’ systems off <strong>Assembly, </strong>a mainframe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language?ref=crisesnotes.com#:~:text=In%20computer%20programming%2C%20assembly%20language,the%20language%20and%20the%20architecture's\"><u>coding language invented in 1947</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>COBOL is the lingua franca of mission critical legacy IT in use since the 1960s and too many systems have been too important to abandon it. “Modernization” has instead been built around making COBOL function somewhere besides a mainframe. The “modernization” of the Treasury’s IT payments infrastructure seems to have constituted a combination of rooting out Assembly code and a basically completed transition of “mainframe” COBOL to an <a href=\"https://oig.treasury.gov/system/files/2024-11/oig25005%20%28508%29.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>“internally-developed RM COBOL”</u></a> running on Linux servers. <a href=\"https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/rm-cobol/1214/RMC-LRM.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>RM COBOL is an update</u></a> on mainframe COBOL “designed for optimum performance and wide portability across a broad diversity of computers and operating systems.” Most notably, the Treasury’s transition to RM COBOL seems to have involved harmonizing more than 30 different COBOL systems <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/10_FMS_CJ_01-22-07_GTG.pdf?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>which had evolved separately</u></a>. It was 30 “dialects” they managed to get to speak one standardized language.&nbsp;</p><p>Does Elon Musk understand any of this? Does he have any grasp of the scale and complexity he is trying to reach into and exercise “influence”? Currently the most urgent and profound danger is not what he intends to make this sprawling apparatus do. The most immediate danger is what might break in the process of <strong>trying</strong> to get <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/overseer-of-federal-payments-system-leaves-treasury-in-trump-era?ref=crisesnotes.com\"><u>this apparatus to do what he wants</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At every step of modernizing this system they have run systems concurrently to make sure the “new” functions as well as the old. Redundant systems are only phased out over long time periods after they have enough data on system functioning to feel confident in the “modernized” infrastructure. This is expensive, time consuming and absolutely necessary to make sure this system functions 100% of the time. Elon Musk, however, has never shown respect or understanding of the concept of a mission critical IT system. All he sees is “inefficiency” because he doesn’t understand that there are some things in this world that need to function no matter what and you spend the additional money to make sure it runs, including when it's being updated.&nbsp;</p><p>This is ultimately not that big a deal when it comes to Twitter — Twitter can go down for a few hours, even a few days. Its function can degrade over time and the website can become less and less usable on a gradual — and then maybe eventually sudden — way down. A worse disruption would be more painful, but ultimately not a crisis for the world. The same cannot be said about the complex and sprawling legacy IT systems and administrative apparatus which make sure that Treasury payments go out, are on time and never fail. To put that another way, the same cannot be said about the system that makes sure the federal government is able to make payments reliably and on time.&nbsp;</p><p>It's also important to state that the number of people who comprehensively understand these legacy IT systems can likely be counted on two hands — and that may be optimistic. It is already a threat to their Mission Critical nature for David Lebryk to be forced out of the Federal Government by Elon Musk. Lebryk, who first joined the Treasury Department in 1989 and slowly worked his way up until he was its highest ranking non-political appointee, is clearly the person on earth who understands this IT apparatus the best. Having known his equivalents on far smaller and less important scales in other legacy IT systems, I can tell you that there are certainly things about this IT system that he knows and no one else does.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, it's possible that he is the only person on earth that fully understands how all the many components of how these sprawling legacy IT systems — really a legacy IT “network” — fits together and interacts. I’m sure the knowledge of the remaining career service professionals at the Treasury can combine their understanding to approximate most of Lebryk’s knowledge, but there is a reason you have and value someone like Lebryk in the first place. Companies have spent millions of dollars hiring back such people to fix mission critical IT systems of far, far less importance.&nbsp;</p><p>I try to keep emotion out of this newsletter. I have always tried to write <em>Notes on the Crises</em> in a calm, detached tone so that the information I highlight shines through. However, I must be honest with readers: I’m absolutely terrified. When I first read the Washington Post’s reporting I subsequently had a panic attack. I am not subject to those. I didn’t have one during the start of Covid-19 when I started writing about the full health, economic, and political consequences in March 2020 and knew before many, many people that millions would die. Nor at any time subsequently did I have one. Even as someone who has spent an unusual amount of time thinking about the Treasury’s internal payments system for a person who has never been in government, I find grasping the full implications of Elon Musk and his apparatchiks reaching into and trying to exert full control over the Treasury’s payment system mind-boggling.&nbsp;</p><p>There is <strong>nothing more important on the entire planet than getting Elon Musk and DOGE out of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service</strong> and allowing career civil service employees to run the Treasury’s internal payments system without capricious and self-serving interference from billionaires and their allies. This effort must fail if we are to safeguard any semblance of due process and lawfulness in the executive branch. A vague anonymous promise that DOGE only has “read only” access is not enough. They need to be rooted out so that we can return to the slower moving, less dangerous, <a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/everything-about-the-trump-administrations-impoundment-putsch-you-were-too-afraid-to-ask/\"><u>“five alarm fire” constitutional crisis</u></a> we were having as of Friday morning.</p><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/content/files/2025/02/Elon-Musk-Wants-to-Get-Operational-Control-of-the-Treasury-s-Payment-System.-This-Could.pdf\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Printer Friendly Version</a></div>","url":"https://www.crisesnotes.com/elon-musk-wants-to-get-operational-control-of-the-treasurys-payment-system-this-could-not-possibly-be-more-dangerous/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"76873973-4b8c-4741-bdd8-1d9631b6e2ce","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"679fff24d8c810000144c40b","reading_time":17}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"COBOL","slug":"cobol"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1022999749","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
