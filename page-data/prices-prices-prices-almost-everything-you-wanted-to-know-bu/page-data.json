At this point there is a lot to talk about, to say the least. In\nfact, part of what has taken this piece so long is any time I got a handle of\nall I wanted to say, yet another layer of the conversation emerged. I had made a\nlot of progress in fleshing out everything I wanted to say and then… Russia\ninvaded Ukraine. I will discuss some of the implications that have for these\nissues later, but there is so much more of interest to say about\nsanctions—especially from a financial regulation perspective.\n\nBefore getting started though, it is important to cover some basics. You may\nhear commentators refer to something called the “price level” and/or talk about\ninflation like it is just one thing. I won’t get into whether inflation is even\na useful concept here (you can read this piece\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/are-general-price-level-indices-theoretically/] to\nget some introductions to my thoughts). But for the purposes of this piece, what\nI am interested in focusing on is the actual price indices published by several\ngovernment statistical agencies. In the United States the main important\nconsumer price indices are the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and the Personal\nConsumption Expenditures price index (PCE). These indexes are published by the\nBureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, respectively.\n\n\nFor our immediate relevant purposes—and most importantly for political\npurposes—movements in these indices are “inflation”. You may see commentators,\nespecially orthodox economists, say that x or y movement in a price index “isn’t\ninflation”. We are just going to ignore attempts to define some idealized\nconception of inflation, separated from the actual measurement of price averages \n\n\nThis is important to clarify because it helps us set aside two types of\narguments that mirror each other. One type of argument tries to set aside\n“idiosyncratic” factors—such as the pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nThese affect a few categories of prices much more than others and thus- so the\nargument goes- are not related to “inflation”. At some point I’d like to devote\nan entire piece to the concept of “categories” in price indices. But for now\nwhat is important is that the price of different products are not inherently\ncomparable. You will be looked at strangely if you say “the average price of a\ntelevision/banana is 400 dollars”. Price indices solve this problem by weighting \ndifferent products, by how much the “average” household spends on that consumer\ngood. But this method makes “inflation” sensitive to the approach towards\nweighting, and makes certain prices (such as rents) very important to the\nbehavior of the overall price index.\n\n\nNotwithstanding that point, the second type of argument claims that there really\nis no such thing as particular factors which impact some categories much more\nthan others. Instead, particular factors are a kind of “superficial\nsmokescreen”, that papers over the “fundamental” factors that are supposedly\ndriving “inflation”. You may think that, among other things, a shortage of\nmicrochips has created unique bottlenecks in car production that have\nparticularly impacted the used car market. Therefore in the absence of a\nmicrochip shortage, measured CPI or PCE would have been lower. The defenders of\nthe second argument posit that since “inflation” is generated by overall demand\nconditions (or more infrequently, “the money supply''), the elimination of\nparticular bottlenecks won’t actually “positively” impact the overall Consumer\nPrice Index.\n\n\nThe economic fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine is a major challenge \nto both these sorts of arguments. Many commentators may wish to dismiss the\neconomic consequences of sanctions on Russia, and the devastation of Ukrainian\nproduction (and exports) as not part of “inflation”. But in both economic policy\nand in politics, “inflation” has no existence outside of these measured indices. \nThe Federal Reserve itself is almost certainly raising interest rates faster and\nhigher than it would otherwise if the invasion had not happened. That is because\nof how it interprets its “price stability” mandate. Of course, at the most basic\nlevel, these price increases still impact ordinary households—even if some\ncommentators want to conceptually distinguish them from “inflation”.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the flipside, the rise of energy and food prices in response to this latest\ncrisis highlights what journalist Matthew Klein\n[https://theovershoot.co/p/understanding-covid-flation] has been highlighting\nfor a long time now—even before the Russian attack the “excess” growth in CPI\nwas almost completely attributable to food (largely meat), energy and “motor\nvehicle related” prices. (See Klein’s excellent chart above). That is without\neven considering the potential knock on price increases from energy costs rising\nfor businesses operating in other industries. Some commentators attribute higher\ninflation in 2021 and early 2022 to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\n[https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text]. But why\nwould the “real” cause of these earlier price increases be a generalized\n“excess” demand when the price increases appeared, in large part, in food and\nenergy. By contrast, price increases in mostly the same sectors are suddenly\nexplicable by supply chain disruptions in the aftermath of war in Eastern\nEurope. The war in Ukraine is horrible. However, there is not a very strong case\nto be made that it has been more disruptive to supply chains than the Covid\npandemic.\n\n\nThese points nonetheless bring me into conflict with some of the progressive and\ncenter left narratives that have surfaced in the past year about inflation. In\ngeneral, I don’t find it shocking or implausible that corporations have pricing\npower that  they can successfully deploy to raise profit margins and prices (at\nleast in certain circumstances). However, “potentially plausible” and “the\nempirically identifiable cause of faster price index growth” are two different\nthings. As I’ve just laid out, the price increases accelerating growth in the\nconsumer price index have mostly not been in sectors with “administered prices”.\nIn other words, not in the sectors where prices are determined by companies \nsetting a price for weeks, months, or even years, at a time, and held constant\nfor a significant number of transactions. Even motor vehicles, which do see\nadministered prices, are unique in that there is a submarket for “used cars”\nmanaged by dealers. This secondhand market sees sudden and large price increases\nthat affect the administered price decisions of car manufacturers (who have\nimportant relationships with those same dealers).\n\n\nThe rest of these markets are, for the most part, managed by formal exchange\nmarkets (such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange). These exchange markets see\nday by day traded prices become a reference price for both wholesale and\nconsumer prices. These markets are jointly managed by financial firms and the\nrules the chartered exchanges administer themselves. Many critiques can be made\nof how these markets are managed—but undeniably, their dynamics are not clearly\nexplained by discrete pricing decisions by corporations. There is a case to be\nmade that a market like meatpacking in the United States (for instance) is\nmostly run by the major meat companies like Cargill or Tyson. But even here, the\nimpact on prices is debatable. Before the pandemic, the main progressive\ncritique of meatpackers [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_hCLjUrK1E] was that\nthey were holding down meat prices for upstream producers, by locking them into\nlong term contracts, and keeping cattle from auctions. Now it may be the case\nthat if the meat industry were restructured, meat packing profit margins would\nfall. But it's very questionable whether meat price growth would have been lower\nduring the pandemic if cattle were returned to the auction price determination\nprocess (which inherently benefits sellers.)\n\n\nThis all being said, it is the case that during at least the first 18 months of\nthe pandemic many corporations experienced significantly elevated profits. Some\nmay look at that and think that contradicts what I am saying, asking: “didn’t\nthose profits come from higher prices?”. I don’t think so. As I explained early\non in the pandemic [https://www.crisesnotes.com/where-do-profits-come-from/],\ntotal profits across all businesses come from a few major sources. One of those\nsources is the government budget balance. Given the large expansion of\ngovernment budget deficits, we should expect higher aggregate profits—regardless\nof specific pricing decisions made by companies. Those profits went up as the\ngovernment temporarily took on business expenses, with programs like the Payroll\nProtection Program. Programs like unemployment insurance provided income to\nnewly unemployed workers (who thus were no longer business expenses either). The\ninfamous “stimulus” checks provided income across the board, to workers and\nnon-workers alike. Both groups spent this income on goods and services sold by\nbusinesses. With these drops in expenses and jump in sales, it's no surprise\nthat profits went up.\n\n\nOne could argue that if companies had “passed on” those higher profits into\nlower prices, overall inflation would have been lower. Some have made a version\n[https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/corporate-profits-drive-60-of-inflation] of\nthis argument. I do not find it very convincing. In the first place, some of \nthose profits came from programs that—implicitly or explicitly—were standing in\nfor retained earnings by companies. These companies didn’t have big enough\n“rainy day” funds to get through the pandemic, and so the government stepped in.\nIs it really the best policy to instantly unwind those savings, just as they got\nbuilt up? Now we can always make the case that far too much profit is being put\ninto dividend payments, stock buybacks and merger and acquisitions. But\nfinancial regulation aimed at forcing businesses to save for a rainy day (an\noption I discussed at the beginning of the pandemic\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/should-we-force-businesses-to-save/]) would still\nnot leave room for cutting target profit margins, in order to lower prices.\nRebalancing away from these alternative uses of cash towards more corporate\nsavings will not solve the “pricing problem”. \n\nFurthermore, in the midst of a pandemic it is unrealistic to expect companies\nnot to prepare for the obvious contingencies that may emerge such as\ngeopolitical instability created by the pandemic such as… well… a war in\nUkraine. These problems emerge without even mentioning that there were very good\nreasons to expect this boost in sales not to last. It is important to keep in\nmind that pricing is forward looking. You set a price, and thus a target profit\nmargin today, in the hopes of having successful financial results in the future.\nCutting target profit margins (or alternatively boosting the estimates of\nbudgeted output) in the expectation that sales growth will be sustained can\neasily lead to financial disaster when sales growth slows, or even reverses. If\nbefore the pandemic companies didn’t already have a sense of how quickly\nmacroeconomic trends can turn against them, the pandemic certainly taught that\nlesson very harshly. \n\n\nThis one time shot of “deficit driven” cash couldn’t sustain lower prices\nindefinitely—if it were even possible to coordinate among companies in the first\nplace. The data that many organizations are relying on to claim that companies\nhave been “price gouging” is financial accounting data of a company’s overall\nresults. The “average profit margin” in financial accounting data is simply\ntotal profits, divided by sales. This is not very informative about much of\nanything: it doesn’t even tell us if companies are raising their target profit\nmargins at the individual product level. In order to provide oversight and\njudgment of business pricing decisions, we need managerial accounting data that\ndelves down to the individual product level. \n\n\nComplicating things further, “cost based” price increases can lead to better\nfinancial results. That’s because businesses generally set profit margins on a\npercentage basis, rather than in dollar terms. In other words, if you set a\nprofit margin on diapers that is 6% of your budgeted average total costs then\nany increase in budgeted average total cost will increase the dollar amount of\nyour profit margin—even though the percentage stays the same. We can debate\nwhether that is an appropriate approach to pricing that is in the public\ninterest. However, the company interest in not having percentage profit margins\nshrinking consistently over time is obvious.\n\n\nNone of this means that we shouldn’t regulate corporately administered prices (I\nwill comment on various proposals for that in the future). Nor does it mean that\nincreasing target profit margins may not be a more significant source of price\nindex growth over the next few years. The fact that there is so much we still\ndon’t know is reason enough to create regulations which make the decisions—and\nthe cost data—of corporate pricing committees far more transparent and open to\ncritical scrutiny. What it does mean is that the answers to these questions are\nnot as simple as they may seem on the surface. So there will need to be a two\npronged approach to managing prices: one which takes the institutional\ndifferences between formal exchange prices and corporately administered prices\nseriously.\n\nPrinter Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i220F9XzZXIIJ6QgTCFaMvHm3Xx-jSKM/view?usp=sharing]","html":"<p><em>This is a premium piece of Notes on the Crises</em></p><p>I haven’t covered what’s been going on in pricing and the “inflation” conversation.
