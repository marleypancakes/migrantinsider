But\ninstead, we have hit very rough terrain. President Biden’s whittled down\ninfrastructure spending plans are in critical danger\n[https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-bills-b9fb060c728da28709fc9effaecb0b9a] \n( weary readers may recall these plans started life as a much more expansive\napproach to“building back better” and what “infrastructure” meant).  As time has\ndraged on, the fights over the Biden administration’s spending agenda have\ncrashed head first into our recurring cycle of debt ceiling crises.\n\nTo recap, for obscure reasons [https://rohangrey.net/files/coinage.pdf] in\nfiscal history, congress has decided to pass appropriations bills which\nauthorized and required spending, while imposing arbitrary limitations on how\nmuch debt the treasury can incur in meeting the obligations which congress has\nimposed on the Treasury. Congress then raises this debt ceiling periodically (or\nsuspends it altogether…). But this is not permitted before making raising it a\nplace for partisan political grandstanding. This spectacle has gotten more\nserious as partisanship sharpened, and the Republican party became more\nsingle-minded in its policy-invariant opposition to Democratic presidents in the\n1990s.\n\n\nThis is the most serious debt ceiling crisis yet — today there is not even a\npretense of negotiations between the parties. Worse, the Democratic party\ncontrols the senate by the thinnest of margins, giving right wing Democrats\nenormous leverage. Many in Washington see what’s at stake as nothing less than\nthe ability of those in the majority to govern and pass the agenda they were\nelected to pass — a reasonable perspective, to my mind.\n\nFor my purposes, what is sufficient is that either some legal or financial\ntechnicality will bypass the obstructions, or the Biden administration's\nspending agenda will need curtailing — or even to be abandoned altogether. I\nthink that is a high cost to bear, especially since there are alternatives. I’ll\nleave aside the complicated legislative maneuvers happening now since others are\ncovering these in great detail. As others are focusing on the legal\ntechnicalities, I will focus on my specialty: the financial technicalities.\n\n\nAvoiding the Ceiling Altogether\n\nBefore we discuss a certain coin of … ample denomination, it’s worth taking a\nstep back to think of other available options. There are more conventional\nmeasures that could have been done to avoid, or at least delay, this\neventuality. But how seriously were these being considered?\n\n\nOne option is to simply keep the balance in the Treasury General Account\n(essentially the U.S. Treasury’s “checking” account) at the Federal Reserve very\nhigh. In thinking about this, I was very surprised to find that as soon as Janet\nYellen became Treasury Secretary, the TGA began precipitously dropping\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=H6Yh]. This is partially understandable:\nfunds from various recently passed legislations presumably began to be dispersed\nin large quantities. Nonetheless, this could always be offset by more treasury\nauctions.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, the downside to sustaining the Treasury’s general account at such\nhigh levels would normally be that you reach the debt ceiling limit that much\nsooner. However, this is not the problem it appears at first sight because the\ndebt ceiling no longer works this way. In the last few rounds of debt ceiling\nfights, congress abandoned simply raising the debt ceiling limit. \n\n\nInstead, they “suspended” the debt ceiling\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-01/u-s-debt-ceiling-suspension-ends-congress-unclear-on-next-step]\n. That means that if no solution was reached by the time of the suspension’s\nexpiration, the new debt ceiling simply became however many treasury securities\nwere in the hands of  “the public”. (The debt ceiling resumed at the end of July\n2021, which is why we’re talking about all this now.) \n\n\nThe “extraordinary measures” the Treasury uses to avoid missing payments\n(whether they be interest payments or social security payments) has carried it\nthis far. But those stopgaps are expected to run out sometime in the next month\nor so.\n\n\nThus, the new structure of temporarily dealing with the debt ceiling obstacle\nhas fundamentally changed how the U.S. Treasury can deal with the situation.\nSince the debt ceiling, if it should return, will just apply to whatever\ntreasuries are outstanding, the Treasury department could have issued 10\ntrillion dollars worth of securities. As we’ve talked about at great length\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/we-should-authorize-the-federal-reserve/], the\nFederal Reserve ensures that Treasury security issuance doesn’t interfere with\nits monetary policy objectives. That means there are no concerns over the\nliquidity of these treasuries, or the overall level of interest rates. \n\n\nOf course, on a day to day level there would have to be a significantly\nincreased level of coordination between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve,\nbut this would be a difference of degree and not of kind.\n\n\nI realized as I wrote this piece that this option created by the new legal\nstructure of the debt ceiling has never been properly articulated publicly (at\nleast as far as I’m aware). That is likely a big reason why the general account\nwasn’t sustained at high levels — or even greatly increased from the “lameduck”\nTrump era. Still, I do find myself somewhat disappointed that Secretary Yellen\ndidn’t do more to make the resumption of the debt ceiling a politically less\npainful experience. I can’t help but wonder if her historical deficit\nhawkishness prevented her considering an option that would have technically\nmeant more debt outstanding sooner.\n\n\nI’ve discussed this option informally with a number of people in economic policy\ncircles over the last couple of years.  I have taken to calling it the “Poor\nman’s Trillion Dollar Platinum Coin”.  While this option is an interesting\nconceptual exercise, it is a moot point now. The debt ceiling has resumed. The\nplatinum coin however, is a live option. \n\n\nWhich brings us to our big boy, the Platinum Coin.\n\n\nYes, #MintTheCoin\n\n\nCould a trillion dollar platinum coin solve our cycle of constitutional crisis\nfrom causing intractable financial chaos? Let’s recap!\n\n\nI’ve discussed this intriguing technicality in U.S. coinage law at the very\nbeginning [https://www.crisesnotes.com/all-your-questions-about-the-trillion/] \nof Notes on the Crises. At the time, it served as a kind of “fiscal rhetoric”. A\nrhetorical tool clear to the public that responding to the Coronavirus\nDepression was financially feasible.\n\nHowever, the coin began life as a discovery by an enterprising independent\nlawyer named Carlos Mucha [https://twitter.com/mucha_carlos], who was\nresearching ways to get around Obama’s debt ceiling crisis. Thus, we have swung\nback around to the “classical” platinum coin debates (and yes, they’ve gone on\nlong enough to have “classical” debates!). It is important to emphasize in the\ncontext of these “classical” debates that this is a currently available\nfinancing instrument which can be used at any time.\n\n\nThe debt ceiling only caps how much debt can be outstanding and not all\nliabilities count for that purpose. An obvious example of a liability that\ndoesn’t count would be the Treasury’s obligation to pay social security payments\nto retirees. Even some currently circulating instruments don’t count under the\ndebt ceiling. For example, the Treasury has the ability to issue its own paper\nmoney (called “Treasury Notes”) which does not count under the debt ceiling. \n\nHowever, paper issuance has its own particular cap of 300 million — an\nantiquated limit which dates from the 19th century! Coin issuance has no such\ncap. However, coins are usually statutorily limited in what denomination they\ncan be issued. It would be technically unfeasible (to say the least!) to issue\ndollar coins in sufficient quantities to cover modern deficit spending.\n\n\nThere is however, one exception. Section 5112(k)\n[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5112] of the U.S. Code authorizes\nthe mint and issuance of:\n\n...platinum bullion coins and proof platinum coins in accordance with such\nspecifications, designs, varieties, quantities, denominations, and inscriptions\nas the Secretary, in the Secretary’s discretion, may prescribe from time to time\n[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5112]\n\n\nIt may seem absurd when you first think of it — but according to this provision\nthe U.S. mint can legally mint platinum coins in denominations of the trillions,\nor more. So, why not?\n\n\nMy colleague Rohan Grey has written the definitive law review article\n[https://rohangrey.net/files/coinage.pdf] on its legality and implications.\nGrey’s piece features an extensive response to all the currently made\nobjections, and likely consequences for the debt ceiling.\n\n\nMoreover, the Treasury Secretary has not only the option, but the constitutional\nobligation to use this coinage power. Coinage must be deployed if it stands as\nthe only option available to her for avoiding default — and so it seems to be! \n\n\nThis constitutional obligation is one reason why it is very concerning that the\nBiden administration has publicly declared that this option is not on the table.\nThe other reason it is concerning is that it means they are willingly ceding\nleverage to Republicans. What will they give up in order to avoid using the coin\noption? \n\n\nDemocrats very understandably want to generate a political narrative around\nRepublican intransgenience — and in fairness, there is a lot of intransgenience\nto point to. [https://newrepublic.com/article/163534/case-partisanship] However,\nit is also intransgent to ignore and leave aside these alternative solutions in\nfavor of a political showdown. I also think Democrats overestimate the political\nbenefit they get from highlighting how difficult republicans are making\nlegislating. Potential voters are just as likely to drop out and feel voting is\npointless as they are to feel extra motivated to vote and oppose Republicans. \nSpending, however, can motivate people. \nAnd the best hope for Democrats passing a big spending bill is for accounting\ngimmicks to be dealt with by accounting gimmicks, rather than lowered\nexpectations. The debt ceiling is an accounting problem, calling out for an\naccounting solution.\n\nThat’s a lot of words to say something simple: Mint the damn coin!
