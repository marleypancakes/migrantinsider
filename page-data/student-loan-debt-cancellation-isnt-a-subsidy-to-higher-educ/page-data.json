They all were important, but the change\nattracting the most attention was canceling ten thousand dollars of student debt\nof each borrower who made less than one hundred and twenty five thousand\ndollars. They also canceled an additional ten thousand dollars for each student\ndebtor who was a Pell Grant recipient. Among other things, this announcement is\nimportant because canceling all student debt has been a key demand of many\nactivists. Cancelation began as a demand of Occupy Wall Street’s “Strike Debt”\n[https://strikedebt.org/is-strike-debt-still-active/], a predecessor to the\n“union of debtors” called the Debt Collective [https://debtcollective.org/]. It\nis well known that I’m an advocate of full student debt cancellation, but\ntoday’s piece will not be about why I think that’s a good idea. Instead, I want\nto focus on an analytical point which I think is being seriously overlooked. \n\nNamely: student debt cancellation is not a subsidy to higher education. The\nsubsidy to higher education comes from student loan credit. What is the\ndifference between student loan credit and student loan debt? Everything.\n\n\nLet’s start at the most basic level. A person who is interested in going to\ncollege but is not yet in college does not start out in student debt. They send\napplications to prospective schools, and at the same time they fill out the Free\nApplication for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This application tells students how\nmuch of a Pell Grant they qualify for, based on their parents’ income (or their\nown income if they are older than 23, or have some other qualifying reason that\nmakes them an “independent student''). It also tells them how much student\ncredit they qualify for. They go through this application process every year.\n\n\nWhen those loans are taken out — i.e. when they tap their student credit — they\nget an asset, a bank deposit, and a liability, their student debt. They may not\neven directly receive that bank deposit. Instead, it might go directly to the\nschool or university they are attending. In either case, some large portion (in\nmany, many cases, all of it) of that student credit becomes income to the\nschool, or university they are attending. Even what does not go to the school\nis, in a larger sense, a subsidy to higher education. That’s because those\nstudents need to cover their basic living expenses, in order to be able to\ncontinue attending school.\n\n\nFor more on terminology used here, read this\n[https://www.crisesnotes.com/the-federal-government-always-money/]\nFrom the moment that students pay their tuition (and possibly room and board)\nwith the proceeds from their student loan, the university has received the\nsubsidy they get from the student loan credit program. The student now has a\ndebt load but very soon after, maybe even instantaneously, after the loan is\nmade the student credits have parted ways from the student debt. The Student is\nleft with debt, and the school is left with income. If this were simply a direct\nsubsidy paid out to schools for providing students education, everything would\nbe the same — except the student would not have debt, and this transaction would\nbe officially booked as government spending. However, the school’s income would\nbe exactly the same. \n\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]One way to think about\nthis is to imagine that an administrator in the Bursar department of some\nuniversity meets at the fork of a road with an incoming student. Suddenly\nsomeone from the department of education drives up. They hand the student a big\nbag of money labeled “student credit”, and tell the student “you owe us now”.\nAfter they drive away, the student hands the bag of money to the administrator.\nThe administrator goes down the road towards the rainbows, while the student\ngoes down the road towards the thunderclouds. They now have nothing to do with\neach other. They are going down different roads. If 10 years down the road(s)\nthe department of education calls and says “wow it really has been stormy down\nthat road, so we’re canceling your debt”, it has no impact on the administrator \n— who is in the land of rainbows and sunshine. \n\n\nNone of this means that students don’t get any benefits from the proceeds of\nstudent loans. They are, after all, choosing to go to school. At least at the\nbeginning of the process, they have some sort of belief that this is going to\nmake their lives better. But the benefit they receive from student loans is\ncertainly not anywhere near equivalent to the face value of the loan, let alone\nthe interest bearing payments they will need to make for many years to come.\nMeanwhile, the benefit that universities are receiving from the student loan\ncredit program is something near the amount of student loans made each year —\ni.e. the fraction that becomes its income.\n\n\nWhen most members of the public (we’ll get to the economists in a second) say\nthat student debt cancellation is a “subsidy to higher education” I think they\nare envisioning that cancellation means that all that money retroactively \nbecomes a subsidy. They are thinking to themselves “well this means that money\nwasn’t really a loan, which means we’ve given hundreds of billions to\nuniversities”. Instead, what I am saying here is that student debt cancellation\nis revealing a multi-billion dollar subsidy\n[https://research.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/trends-college-pricing-student-aid-2021.pdf#page=37]\n. A subsidy that was originally “off-balance sheet” but long ago “went out the\ndoor”. \n\n\nLet’s be very clear on who this policy helps out. Unburdening former students\ndoes not change anything for the school. They’ve got nothing to do with the\nschools they attended. Struggling former attendees are not much more than a\npublic relations problem for colleges and universities. Revealing this subsidy\nthrough debt cancellation is an explicit goal of the activists who are pushing\nthis\n[https://theintercept.com/2021/01/25/student-debt-you-are-not-a-loan-film/?fbclid=IwAR0J-tvn2NTPi43LCOVeSC_syU4BsPwqV50vX6pVQELRULGRGCcjFkrh05s]\n. I think the public reaction to cancellation actually happening is illustrating\nthat it has made people much more aware that higher education has deep problems.\nIt’s now clear that higher ed needs to be regulated much more vigorously, since\nwe’ve been handing its more than many billions more dollars each year than we\nrealized.\n\n\n\n\nI know there are economists reading this who think what I’m saying is obtuse.\nThey are bubbling over with the sentiment that I just do not understand.\nSpecifically, they do not care about the past\n[https://twitter.com/nomadj1s/status/1562919845750083584] (which is what the\npiece so far has been about). To these economists, what is significant is\nlooking to the future. So when I say that student debt cancellation isn’t a\nsubsidy to higher education because it was the student loan credit which became\nhigher education’s income, they get frustrated. They think to themselves: “Yes,\nbut this is going to get more people to attend college in the future”. More\nprecisely, students may take into consideration that their debts will simply be\ncanceled and take out more student loans than they otherwise would and attend\nhigher tuition schools than they otherwise would. \n\nI think this sort of response is misguided for two reasons. First, it overrates\nthe “forward looking” behavior of college students. Morespecifically, it makes\nthe possibility that there will be a convenient Democratic Party administration,\nwho is willing to cancel more student debt a far more predictable eventuality\nthan it is. The people in their twenties who I know are much more likely to be\nindifferent to taking on student loans, whether because of future climate\ncatastrophe, or the Republican party successfully ending democracy than faith in\na future Democratic administration. \n\n\nSecond, and more fundamentally, this response misses that even if students tap\ngreater amounts of student credit in the future, it is still the student loan\ncredit program that is providing the subsidy. Without the program, cancellation\nwould have no avenue for influencing future student’s behavior. Student debt\ncancellation may induce significantly more people to seek college — though I am\ndoubtful. But either way, it's still the credit program providing the subsidy.\nFurthermore, the vast, vast majority of this subsidy was going to go out the\ndoor, whether student debt was canceled or not. \n\n\n\n\nFinally, it is much more likely that another change the Biden administration\nannounced will induce greater student attendance than outright cancellation —\nchanges to the Income-Based Repayment program.\n[https://www.americanprogress.org/article/proposed-student-loan-repayment-plan-would-extend-the-same-income-based-terms-to-all-federal-loan-borrowers/] \nSince the mid-90s a series of successive administrations — making it a\nbipartisan project- have introduced increasingly “generous” programs for making\nstudent debt payments based on income rather than debt loads. They have done\nthis out of recognition that vast swathes of this debt is unpayable\n[https://marshallsteinbaum.org/assets/pinto-and-steinbaum-2022-long-run-impact-of-the-great-recession-on-student-debt-draft-of-3-20-22-.pdf] \nbut an unwillingness\n[https://marshallsteinbaum.org/assets/msd4-2020-student-debt-crisis-is-a-crisis-of-non-repayment.pdf] \nto politically admit that because it would be a fundamental challenge to the\nhigher education policy status quo. \n\n\nAfter 20-25 years of “income based” payments, the remaining loan balance is\ncanceled. In 1994 they started out needing to make payments equal to  20% of\n“discretionary income”, then lowering it to 15% in 2007. The Obama\nAdministration in turn lowered it to 10%. The Biden administration is now\nlowering it to 5%\n[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-student-loan-relief-for-borrowers-who-need-it-most/]\n. If prospective students understand the meaning of these IBR changes — and if\nthey are confident that they will continue — then the size of the loans they\ntake out are increasingly irrelevant, as long as they “only” have to pay 5% of\ntheir income. This is a forward looking policy change, and so it's much more\nlikely to impact students' calculations about how “worth it” it is to take on\nstudent debt. On the other hand, students who take out eye-watering amounts of\ndebt on the promise of income-based repayments may have a much more difficult\ntime documenting their income\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/30/opinion/student-loan-debt-relief-biden.html]\n, working with servicer companies and staying in the program each year than they\nrealize.\n\n\nThe changes to Income Based Repayment highlights that student debt cancellation\nis coming in one form or another. It will either be immediate and politicize\nhigher education finance, or it will be delayed, hidden and depoliticized under\nIBR. It will also involve far more burdens to student debtors. In this sense,\nthere are two competing political instincts in Biden’s policy changes. One is\nthe activist instinct to cancel debt now while the other is the technocratic\ninstinct to hide cancellation in the future. Whether the debt is canceled now,\nor canceled later, the subsidy to higher education is already going out the\ndoor. It would be going out the door whether policy changed or not. It is\ncrucially important to think about student loan credit and student loan debt as\ntwo very different things, even if they start on the same road.\n\nSubscribe [https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup]Printer Friendly Version\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eCx6pndmFtJJ2anAZ9sJnkqWKnbDpM4l/view?usp=sharing]","html":"<div class=\"kg-card kg-button-card kg-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.crisesnotes.com/#/portal/signup\" class=\"kg-btn kg-btn-accent\">Subscribe</a></div><p>Last Wednesday the Biden Administration announced a number of changes to how student debt would be treated by the Federal Government.
